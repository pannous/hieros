ܐܪܡ Aramaic ארמישע ָaRamische! 1. Römisch 2. Ramoishe a) Ramses b) Moses !!    ܐܪܡܝܐ‎, ארמיא Arāmāyā √root

Imperial Aramaic almost like Hebrew ++ SO DONT BOTHER LEARNING IT!
Aramaic only language in this part of the family that isn't dead
Aramaic has a continuity that Hebrew doesn't, since it was revived



In one sense, all languages are equally old.
Individual languages are the product of gradual changes, like evolution, and a result of splitting lineages, and recombining!



Hebrew has also lost a lot of features, like pharyngeals, and undergone some shifts, like coda spirantization. I'm not sure when these changes occurred in time, though. Spirantization may have occurred very early, and some communities still speak Hebrew with some amount of pharyngealization even today. Conversely, Aramaic still has a full set of pharyngealized consonants (like Arabic).

modern Hebrew has quite a bit of influence from European languages, particularly German. Germany was home to the communities of Jews that are now called Ashkenazi, and they developed their own Germanic language called Yiddish

PREFACE
THIS work, although prepared as a companion to the Exhaustive Concordance, to which it is specially adapted is here paged & printed so that it can be bound separately, in the belief that a brief & simple Dictionary of the Biblical Hebrew & Chaldee will be useful to students & others, who do not care at all times to consult a more copious & elaborate Lexicon; & it will be particularly serviceable to many who are unable to turn conveniently & rapidly, amid the perplexities & details of foreign characters with which the pages of Gesenius & Furst bristle, to the fundamental & essential points of information that they are seeking. Even scholars will find here, not only all of a strictly verbal character which they most frequently want in ordinary consultation of a lexicon, but numerous original suggestions, relations, & distinctions, carefully made & clearly put, which are not unworthy of their attention, especially in the affinities of roots & the classification of meanings. The compact form & moderate cost of the book, it is hoped, will facilitate its use with all classes. The vocabulary is complete as to the ground-forms that actually occur in the biblical text (or Kethib), with the pointing that properly belongs to them. Their designation by numbers will especially aid those who are not very familiar with the original language, & the Anglicizing & pronunciation of the words will not come amiss to multitudes who have some acquaintance with it. The addition of the renderings in the common version will greatly contribute to fixing & extending the varied significations & applications of the Hebrew & Chaldee words, as well as to correcting their occasionally wrong translations. On this account, as well as for the sake of precision & to prevent repetition, the use of the same terms in the preceding definitions has been avoided wherever practicable. The design of the volume, being purely lexical, does not include grammatical, archaeological, or exegetical details, which would have swelled its size & encumbered its plan.
By observing the subjoined directions, in the associated use of the Main & Comparative Concordances, the reader will have substantially a Concordance-Dictionary of both the Authorized & the Revised English Versions, as well as of the Hebrew Bible.
Copyright. 1890. By JAMES STRONG, MADISON, NJ

PLAN OF THE BOOK

1. All the original words are treated in their alphabetical Hebrew order, & are numbered regularly <- the first to the last, each being known throughout by its appropriate number. This renders reference easy without recourse to the Hebrew characters
2. Immediately after each word is given its exact equivalent in English letters, according to the system of transliteration laid down in the scheme here following, which is substantially that adopted in the Common English Version, only more consistently & uniformly carried out; so that the word could be readily be turned back again into Hebrew <- the form thus given it.
3. Next follows the precise pronunciation, according to the usual English mode of sounding syllables, so plainly indicated that none can fail to apprehend & apply it. The most approved sounds are adopted, as laid down in the annexed scheme of articulation, & in such a way that any good Hebraist would immediately recognize the word if so pronounce, notwithstanding the minor ~s current among scholars in this respect.
4. Then ensues a tracing of the etymology, radical meaning, & applied signification of the word, justly but tersely analyzed & expressed, with any other important peculiarities in this regard.
5. In the case of proper names, the same method is pursued, & at this point the regular mode of Anglicizing it, after the general style of the Common English Version, is given, & a few words of explanation are added to identify it.
6. Finally (after the punctuation-mark : ) are given all the different renderings of the word in the Authorized English Version, arranged in the alphabetical order of the leading terms, & conveniently condensed according to the explanations given below.
By searching out these various renderings in the MAIN CONCORDANCE, to which this dictionary is designed as a companion, & noting the passages to which the same number ~=that of any given Hebrew word is attached in the marginal column, the reader, whether acquainted with the original language or not, will obtain a complete Hebrew Concordance also, expressed in the words of the Common English Version. This is an advantage which no other Concordance or Lexicon affords.
SIGNS EMPLOYED
+ (addition) denotes a rendering in the A.V. of one or more Heb. words in connection with the one under consideration.
X (multiplication) denotes a rendering in the A.V. that results <- an idiom peculiar to the Heb.
o
(degree), appended to a Heb.word, denotes a vowel-pointing correct <- the text. (This mark is set in Heb. Bibles over syllables in which the vowels of the marg. Have been inserted instead of those properly belonging to the text.)
( ) (parenthesis), in the renderings <- the A.V., denotes a word or syllable sometimes given in connection with the principle word to which it is annexed.
[ ] (bracket), in the rendering <- the A.V., denotes the inclusion of an additional word in the Heb.
Itallics, at the end of a rendering <- the A.V., denote an explanation of the ~s <- the usual form.
