FOREWORD
It is a pleasure and privilege to inaugurate the first published fascicle of the Chicago Hittite Dictionary. A fitting introduction to the new volume may be to sketch the history of the project that gave it birth.
In 1963, the year in which he received his doctorate from Brandeis University, Harry Hoffner began assembling Hittite lexical files as a tool for personal research. The files were compiled according to the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary method of transliterating extensive contexts and reproducing multiple file copies for parsing individual words. From 1964 to 1973, while teaching at Brandeis and Yale, Hoffner put on file about 65% of the published Hittite material. In autumn 1972, he spent a sabbatical term with Heinrich Otten at Marburg. Through Otten's generosity, Hoffner was able to use the lexical file at the Marburg Seminar for completion of his book Alimenta Hethaeorum. Learning that Otten's plans to produce a Hittite thesaurus were likely to be delayed for many years, Hoffner began to appreciate the need for a Hittite-English
lexical tool of intermediate length that could be completed over the next few decades. When Hoffner was invited in 1973 to come to the Oriental Institute in Chicago, he and Hans Giuterbock saw the opportunity for a long hoped-for collaboration. Gilterbock had extensive experience in Hittite lexical studies, but no files. Hoffner had files, but felt the need for an
experienced and learned colleague with Gilterbock's background. It was an ideal combination, and both men agreed to set the plan in motion. After Hoffner had come to Chicago in 1974, he was given a part-time student assistant and the equipment necessary to house and expand his files. In 1975 a formal application was submitted to the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund a full-scale dictionary project.
With the award of a substantial three-year grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities at the beginning of 1976, the Hittite Dictionary project was able to hire a full-time research associate, Howard Berman, and several graduate-student assistants. The files were rapidly augmented, colleagues were advised of the new status of the project, and the decision was made to begin the dictionary with the letter "L" to avoid immediate overlap with Annelies Kammenhuber's Hittite-German work. In 1977, Emmanuel Laroche agreed to read and criticize selected articles as an outside consultant, and the first drafts of many "L" words were written. By
1978 sufficient progress had been made to have Eisenbrauns prepare offset samples of dictionary articles and to apply for a second three-year grant from the National Endowment for the
Humanities.
Now in 1979, as the Oriental Institute prepares to celebrate its sixtieth anniversary, the
National Endowment for the Humanities has renewed its grant support; and the first fascicle of the Chicago Hittite Dictionary is ready to go to press.
In a multifaceted project such as this, acknowledgements are due in many quarters. First a deep debt of gratitude is owed to the editors and their staff. Professor Hoffner is to be thanked for over ten years of unassisted labor, out of which grew the main dictionary file of the project, and for his continuing painstaking service as Executive Editor. In the latter capacity he has been responsible not only for writing and editing the dictionary articles but also for negotiating the National Endowment for the Humanities grants and supervising the work of the junior staff. The Senior Editor, Professor Giiterbock, has brought to the project a rare expertise born of many
vii

years of philological and archeological work reaching back to the days when the field of Hittitology was in its infancy. Besides writing and criticizing manuscripts, he has provided a mine of information on all aspects of Hittite language, history, and culture freely drawn on by the staff. Dr. Howard Berman, as Research Associate, has provided a careful philological approach to Hittite combined with a valuable background in linguistics and a study of the historical reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European. Finally the world of scholarship must acknowledge the
indispensable support of the National Endowment for the Humanities, Research Tools Division, without whose aid this dictionary could not have appeared. It is the unique combination of all these efforts that has produced the present work.

PREFACE
The Hittite language is the earliest preserved member of the Indo-European family of lan- guages. It was written on clay tablets in central Asia Minor over a five hundred year span (c. 1650-1180 B.c.) which witnessed the rise, the floruit and the decline of many political powers in the Near East. It is studied today for a wide variety of reasons. Historical linguists seek information in Hittite texts to elucidate the relationships between the various member languages of the Indo-European family, as well as the probable structure of their common parent, Proto- Indo-European. Historians find in Hittite annals, treaties, royal edicts and political correspon- dence information of great value in reconstructing the sequence of events on the international scene of mid-second-millennium Western Asia. Anthropologists, mythographers, and students of comparative religion mine the riches of Hittite religious texts: myth, magic rituals to cure ailments, festivals to worship the gods of the empire. Students of the history of law discover ancient precedents for legal procedures which have survived to this day. All of these interested researchers share a dependence upon the written texts. None can penetrate further than our limited understanding of this language allows.
The vast majority of Hittite tablets derive from the ruins of the ancient Hittite capital Hattusa located near the modern Turkish town of Bogazkale (earlier name: Bogazk6y) about 210 kilometers east of Ankara. Scientific excavation of these ruins by a German team began in 1906. About 10,000 clay tablets inscribed with the familiar Assyro-Babylonian script came to light. Although some were written in the Akkadian language and could be read immediately, most were in an unknown language, correctly assumed to be Hittite. Within ten years the language had been deciphered, and a sketch of its grammar published. Gradually, the international community of scholars, led by the Germans, extended the boundaries of the known. The number of common Hittite words which one could translate with reasonable certainty increased steadily. Glossaries published in 1936 by Edgar Sturtevant (in English) and in 1952 by Johannes Friedrich (in German) admirably served the needs of their contemporaries. Yet today, seventy-five years after the decipherment, there still exists no complete dictionary of the Hittite language.
Certain conditions must be met before a Hittite dictionary can be written. Fundamental to all others is the first: a sufficient percentage of the excavated tablets must be published or made available in unpublished form to the dictionary editors. At this writing thirty-one volumes of the KBo series have appeared, fifty-eight of the KUB series, four of the IBoT, and five singly published volumes. Thus ninety-eight volumes of published Hittite texts exist, each containing on the average fifty plates of copies, totalling 4,900 plates of Hittite texts. Although the total number of Hittite fragments with excavation or museum numbers may amount to 30,000, most of these are quite small in size. In terms of complete lines of Hittite text, more than half the amount of excavated text material has been published. This remarkable achievement over a period of half a century is a tribute to Ehelolf, Figulla, Goetze, Gtiterbock, Klengel, Walther, Weidner and others, who labored at the task of making cuneiform copies of Hittite texts, but especially in recent years to Otten, who copied all or large parts of over twenty volumes.
Lexical surprises still come from newly published texts. But as the published corpus grows, the number of such surprises diminishes. In order to reduce the number of surprises, the editors of a
ix
 oi.uchicago.edu
dictionary such as this should be allowed access to and use of all known texts, published or unpublished. In his 1982 review of CHD's first fascicle (ZA 72:280-288) H. Otten claimed that no dictionary of Hittite written today could be satisfactory without full use of known unpublished texts. During the first years of our work on the CHD, while fascicles 1-3 were being prepared, Giterbock was allowed to use some of these unpublished texts in his publications, which included the CHD. But in 1985, as we were putting fascicle 3 to press, Otten wrote to Giterbock, denying him the right to use for the CHD any unpublished Hittite text. We deeply regret that Otten has thus made it impossible for us to provide our users with data from the unpublished texts. Nevertheless, this loss, serious as it is, is clearly not sufficient reason to discontinue the production of the CHD, since it is based upon a very large corpus of published texts augmented by many printed quotations from unpublished texts.
A second condition is sufficient progress in the editing of texts. Although the decipherer Hrozny himself wrote the first edition of a Hittite text from Bogazkoy in 1919, it was Ferdinand Sommer who in 1925 founded the first series to publish editions of Hittite texts, the Hethitische Texte subseries of the Mitteilungen der Vorderasiatisch-igyptischenGesellschaft. The two modern series of Hittite text editions are Studien zu den Bogazkiy-Texten (Wiesbaden) and Texte der Hethiter (Heidelberg), which to date have produced forty-four volumes. To these two series must also be added the numerous text editions which have appeared over the past seventy years in other books and articles.
Most text editions contain philological commentary in which the meanings of certain key Hittite words are discussed. In addition there have been many lexical studies which have appeared in books and articles not primarily concerned with text editions. Studies of this type published during the first twenty to forty years of Hittitology formed the basis of the first two glossaries of Hittite, those by Sturtevant (1936) and Friedrich (1952). Most frequently cited in these two glossaries are the contributions of Ehelolf, Friedrich, Goetze, Giiterbock, Laroche and Sommer. Since 1952 new generations of Hittitologists have enlarged and refined the earlier work epitomized in Friedrich's Hethitisches Worterbuch. It is the task of the CHD and the HW 2 to evaluate and
exploit the studies of this thirty-year period, while also adding fresh insights which grow out of a prolonged and systematic occupation with the task of dictionary writing.
It would be difficult to conceive of writing a Hittite dictionary without a tool such as E. Laroche's Catalogue des textes hittites (CTH), first published in 1956-58 and now in a thoroughly revised and augmented second edition of 1971. This systematic classification of the published Bogazkoy tablets allows each Hittitologist to utilize all known copies of a given composition to create his own critical edition, or to supplement and correct an older published edition by means of more recently found evidence. The usefulness of CTH is universally recognized. The front matter of each new volume of cuneiform copies now often identifies each published fragment by its CTH number. Discoveries of additional joins or duplicates are regularly reported and related to the CTH numbering system. As in the assembling of a jigsaw puzzle, the identifying and placing of new pieces becomes easier as the picture grows more complete. The contribution of such work to lexical study is obvious. Joining and thus reconstructing tablets from their frag- mentary remains affords full contexts in passages where the words occur. Identification of duplicates often leads to a discovery that a syllabically written Hittite word in one copy is written with a Sumerogram or Akkadogram of known meaning in its duplicate. Therefore it is no mere coincidence that Laroche's preparation of the first edition of his Catalogue was carried out
concurrently with his significant lexical studies of 1947 through 1958.
No dictionary of a language written over a span of five centuries would be serviceable without
reliable criteria for determining the dates of the texts on which it is based. There must be an
 oi.uchicago.edu
agreed upon basis for distinguishing earlier from later compositions and - in the case of traditional, transmitted texts - the earlier from the later copies of the same composition. Indeed the date of the original composition of some texts can be determined on the basis of named authors, in most cases a king. But for the majority of religious and administrative texts not datable by this means the following methods have been developed. The copy is dated by noting the latest palaeographic features of its script. The original composition is dated by noting the oldest orthographic, grammatical, and lexical features to be found in its copies. In the CHD we have chosen to abbreviate our conclusions in the form OH/NS, which is to be interpreted as "deriving from OH archetype, but showing New Script and often considerable linguistic moderni- zation." We distinguish Old Script (Otten's "typisch alt" and "alt", Starke's I), Middle Script (Otten's "altere Schrift," "altlich," etc., Starke's II), and New Script (Starke's III), only occasion- ally differentiating early and late forms of NS (ENS, LNS). We have not attempted to date as precisely as Starke (StBoT 30:21-27: Ia, b, IIa,b, c, etc.) by script alone. When dating texts attributable to specific kings of the empire period, we have usually made no comment about the script. But the reader should not conclude from such words as "prayer of Murs. II" after a citation that the copy cited was necessarily made during that same king's reign. But a Hattusili III copy of Mursili II composition is not as likely to show significant grammatical innovations as a Hattusili III copy of a HJattusili I text.
In matters of text dating we concur in the main with the judgments of Carruba, Otten and Neu, in contrast to the views of Kammenhuber. For two reasons we have decided not to include here a complete listing of the Old and Middle Hittite corpora according to our point of view. First, provisional lists are available with which we are in general agreement. And secondly, we deem it wiser to continue to refine our own dating scheme and to print it on a later occasion. Since evidence will continue to accumulate, our opinions will certainly change. It is inevitable that not all datings in this volume will be retained in future ones. In most cases, however, changes will be minor, such as discovering from a newly published OS duplicate that a text which we previously
called NH was in reality OH/NS. Users of the CHD can easily accommodate such developments. Although published lexical studies provide a broad base of information about the occurrence of certain Hittite words, no dictionary could be written without extensive lexical files. The main lexical file of the CHD, consisting of nearly a million cards, now gives complete coverage to published texts including KBo 30 and 33 and KUB 58. It is based upon the personal lexical file of H. A. Hoffner, built up from 1963 through 1975, augmented by Hoffner, Berman, Beal, van den Hout and McMahon working under a series of grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities from 1976-1989. A much smaller, but significant source is the personal lexical file of Gilterbock. In addition, a computer file of the most significant texts, compiled by Hoffner,
supplements and checks the main card file.
Since we believe that the conditions for the writing of a Hittite dictionary have been met, we
have embarked upon the production of the CHD.
While in many ways we have consciously imitated the organization, procedure and format of
our sister dictionary, The Assyrian Dictionaryof the OrientalInstitute (CAD), the smaller size of the Hittite text corpus insures that the CHD will be more limited in size and scope. We attempt to give complete coverage of the representative occurrences of each Hittite word, but we will not seek to be exhaustive. Words whose occurrences are fully registered are marked by a daggert.
Although Hittite dictionary and thesaurus projects have been initiated in Germany by A. Kammenhuber, we do not consider our work a mere duplication. The CHD is primarily designed for English-speaking scholars and students, who truly need and deserve an up-to-date Hittite dictionary in their own language. Our procedure, organization, and views on text dating differ
xi
 oi.uchicago.edu
from Kammenhuber's. In no way do we wish to disparage her work; we welcome it and profit from it. But while we are eager to learn from her experience, we have adopted distinctive operating procedures and do not intend to model our dictionary upon hers.
The specific ways in which the CHD approach will differ from HW 2 have already been outlined by Hoffner in his review of its first fascicle in Bibliotheca Orientalis35:242ff. We seek to give the user a maximum of usable information, allowing him to see not only our conclusions but the basis for them. The CHD does not attempt to determine the Proto-Indo-European origins of Hittite words. In that sense it is not an etymological dictionary. Words borrowed into Hittite from some identifiable foreign source will be noted as such. In many cases our dictionary does not list all known occurrences of a particular form or a semantic usage, but adduces those which are representative of a time period (OH, MH, NH), of a text genre (myth, ritual, law), or an ethno- cultural milieu (Hurrian, Hattian, Luwian).
The alphabetization scheme for the dictionary's entries is essentially that used by HW. The consonant alternations b/p, d/t, and g/k/q have been merged and alphabetized as p, t, k. Consonantal doubling is ignored. Also adjacent i and y or u and w are alphabetized as single i or u.
It is well-known that the vowels e and i often interchange in the spelling of Hittite words. In the earliest texts scribes clearly sought to maintain a distinction. What consistency underlies later usage and whether the post-OH spelling conventions also reflect a continuing phonological distinction between e and i are matters of controversy. Our decision to consider the two vowels equivalent for the purposes of the alphabetization of lemmas and to list them in the i position was made without prejudice as to what may be the eventual resolution of the controversy. Ours was a practical procedural decision intended to reduce the number of necessary cross references of the type "zenna- see zinna-."
When different spellings are attested for the stem of a word (lahlahbeskinu-, lahhilabhhekinu-), we have alphabetized according to that form of the stem which allows the entry to appear closest to its cognates.
In the morphological section we have sought to adduce at least one example of each spelling of the form under consideration. We have usually refrained from citing more than two or three locations for the same spelling in the same diachronic phase of the language. If given a choice, we have preferred to cite well-preserved rather than broken examples of each spelling. If we cite a line to locate a form which is partially broken, we place the line number in parentheses. If we cite a line to locate a form which requires emendation, we place an exclamation point after the line number. Such exclamation points do not, therefore, indicate a correction of the line count. Normally in the morphological section we employ the line count of the cuneiform copy rather than a cumulative one from an edition. Unless the lines in a column interrupted by a lacuna of undetermined length are numbered 1, 2, 3, .. . 1', 2', 3', etc., we have not used prime numbers in line counts.
The morphological terminology is that used conventionally by our colleagues with two excep- tions: (1) we have called the nominal case in -a the "allative" in preference to either "directive" or "terminative." Our objections to "directive" are those adduced by F. Starke in StBoT 23 (1977) 23 with note 12. In addition, the standard complete dictionary of American English, Webster's Third New InternationalDictionaryof the English Language Unabridged,attests no use of "directive" as a designation of a noun case. Although "terminative," once suggested by Hoffner and advocated by Starke, is not unacceptable to us, in English it occasions some confusion, since its well- established usage with verbs in the sense of perfective (see F. Josephson, The Function of Sentence Particles in Old and Middle Hittite, page 33) beclouds its more recent employment to describe noun case. "Allative," on the other hand, enjoys a clear usage in noun-case terminology, being defined in Webster's New InternationalDictionaryofthe English LanguageSecond Edition
X11
 oi.uchicago.edu
Unabridged: "Designating or pertaining to a case which expresses the relational idea of motion to or toward." Its symmetry with other case designations such as ablative and illative (the latter roughly equivalent to allative in Hittite grammar) also favors its adoption. Our choice of English terms is not to be regarded as a rejection of the argument or conclusions of Starke as to the functions of this case. For another opinion see Kammenhuber in E. Neu and W. Meid, eds., Hethitisch und Indogermanisch, 115ff. (2) Building upon E. Laroche's identification of an ergative in Hittite (BSL 57, 1962, 23-43), we decided not only to identify such forms as "ergative," but even to include them in the paradigms of the base neuter noun. Although this has earned us some criticism in reviews, the forthcoming article of Andrew Garrett ("The Origins of NP Split Ergativity" in B. Need and E. Schiller, eds., Proceedings of the Conference on the Theory and Practice of HistoricalLinguistics Chicago, April 27, 1988, University of Chicago Special Publications in Linguistics 2) seems to justify the description of Hittite as a language showing "split ergativity."
Bilingual evidence has been assigned a location between morphological and semantic sections, although bilingual passages may be cross-referenced at a point in the semantic section appropriate to their semantic content or usage.
The significance of the number and letter hierarchy of the CHD in its semantic section is essentially the same as that of the CAD. In those articles where the Hittite word requires a different English translation in each of its principal usages the highest level of the hierarchy (i.e., the primary division) is represented by Arabic numerals, which correlate with translations in the article heading. In those articles where the Hittite word may be uniformly translated in all its usages the primary division of the article is represented by lower case letters of the alphabet.
Within the semantic section wider contexts are indicated by means of English translations (in quotation marks) or paraphrases, while a minimal significant context is given both in Hittite and English. Only the key word is transliterated; other Hittite words are rendered in broad transcrip- tion. When it is deemed necessary to indicate morpheme boundaries within a Hittite word cited in
broad transcription, the mark , is used in preference to the simple hyphen (e.g., kessarusmus a "and my hands"). In all cases text references are to the cuneiform copies with additional information about cumulative line count in published editions. We indicate line count as follows. In the case of vertically joined tablet fragments, if there is a difference between separate and cumulative line count and there is a need for indicating both, the separate is given first followed by cumulative, e.g., KBo 3.8 ii 34-35 (= KUB 7.1 + KBo 3.8 ii 68-69). Otherwise only the separate will be given, as regularly in the morphological section. Lateral joins are indicated KUB 31.4 obv. 15 + KBo 3.41 obv. 14. Some elaborate and complex tablet reconstructions are simpler to cite in a standard cumulative line count, e.g., Otten's line count for the Vow of Puduhepa adopted from StBoT 1 and used, e.g., in our laman article, or 2 Mast. cited from Rost's edition.
Following the text references appears information about text type, date, and published studies. Suspect readings are indicated -ta(sic)-, emended readings -ga!-, and collations -ga(coll.)-.
Unpublished texts derived from published references are noted, e.g., Bo 3348 i 6 (StBoT 15:24). Transliteration follows the conventions of Hittitology, which in turn were derived from Assyri- ology. We have tried to avoid a faddish striving to incorporate the very latest values proposed for Sumerian words. Like the CAD, we do not hesitate to use what might look like an outmoded writing of these words. Since this is not a Sumerian dictionary, we have had as our primary concern the unambiguous representation in transliteration and transcription of the actual signs which occur on the Hittite tablets. Our second consideration is the obvious value of using writings familiar to Hittitology itself. We do not wish to make it difficult to correlate earlier editions of
Hittite texts with our dictionary renderings. For all these reasons we have kept our adjustments and innovations to a bare minimum. We wish to avoid the subscript x-values. Therefore, since Borger (Assyrisch-babylonischeZeichenliste,AOAT 33, 1978) gives a numbered value for ENx
X111
 oi.uchicago.edu
GANA (BURU14), and for GESTIN as a Hittite syllabic sign (wi5), we have adopted these. We have also followed him in reading GISKIRI6 for GIS.SAR, and LTSAGI(.A) for LOQA.SU. DUs(.A). We have retained SAL in preference to MUNUS since it is so frequent, and we prefer a shorter form to conserve space. Because we use Arabic, not Roman numerals, we have avoided dX and dXXX for the Stormgod and Moongod. And since dU and dSIN are familiar writings in our discipline, we have decided to continue to use them rather than the unfamiliar dl0 and d30. Hittitologists understand that these signs are conventional designations for Stormgod and Moon- god and do not pretend to identify the deities with Adad or Sin. Since we will never read the other Moongod designation dEN.ZU as dSIN, no confusion is likely to arise. Unfortunately, Borger did not assign index numbers to the "ZU" value of the sign KAxUD, the "li" value of LIS, the "d/tan" value of DIN, the "SUR" value of SAG (in SAG.DJ.AMUSEN), or the "UH" value of U+KAK at Bogazkiy. Gotze (NBr 14) was of the opinion that the U+KAK sign derived from the same prototype as the sign normally used for ab/ih/ub in Hittite texts, but that its different shape was preserved for the logographic representation of alwanzatar"sorcery." Indeed the lexical entry [u-ub] [AH] = [ki-is-pu] = (Hitt.) al-wa-an-za-tarSa Voc. B 8' is cited in CAD K 454. But the AH (number one) sign confidently restored is not preserved for us to observe its shape. The usual Sumerogram for Akkadian kispiC is UH 4 (KAxBAD). Although U+KAK is probably a variant shape of AH/UH (number one), we have chosen to assign it the value UHx to avoid confusing it with the regular shape of UH (number one). We realize that such orthographic decisions are in large measure arbitrary and make no claim that our procedures are "better" than those adopted by others. We wish to avoid confusion, however, by stating at the outset what our symbols mean. A new sign list for Hittite texts by E. Neu and Chr. Riister has been announced, which will employ all of the newer values from R. Borger's Akkadian sign list.
We express our appreciation to the curators and directors of the archaeological museums whose Hittite tablets we have been allowed to collate and photograph: Raci Temizer and Inci Bayburtluoglu (Ankara), Necati Dolunay, Aykut Ozet, Nu§in Askeri, Veysel Donbaz and Fatma Yildiz (Istanbul), Liane Jakob-Rost and Horst Klengel (Berlin), Christopher Walker (London), Pierre Amiet (Paris), W. W. Hallo (Yale University, New Haven), Erle Leichty and Ake Sjiberg (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia), and J. A. Brinkman and Janet Johnson (The Oriental Institute, Chicago). We also remember the kindnesses extended to us by the late G. R. Meyer (Berlin), Nezih Firatl (Istanbul) and Edmund Sollberger (London).
To the University of Chicago and its president, Hanna H. Gray, and to the Oriental Institute and its directors, John A. Brinkman and Janet H. Johnson, who provided partial financial support and a wide variety of services and resources which furthered our work, we express our thanks.
Research Associates during the period that volume L-N was in preparation were Howard R. Berman, Silvin Kosak, Ahmet Unal and Richard H. Beal. Visiting contributors were Philo Houwink ten Cate and Gary M. Beckman.
Graduate student assistants with a Hittitological concentration who gave much assistance over this same period were: Richard H. Beal, J. Gregory McMahon, Barbara Knowles, Margaret Schroeder, and George Moore.
We are indebted to E. Laroche, who as our outside consultant read and commented upon a number of articles, although ill health prevented him from as extensive an involvement in the work as he and we had hoped for.
Especially to the National Endowment for the Humanities, its former directors Mr. Ronald Berman, Mr. Joseph Duffey and Mr. William Bennett, and its present director, Ms. Lynne Cheney, we are grateful for generous and sustained financial support.

9. Adverbs - a. appa la-: the adverb appa is used with la- to indicate the return to a pre- vious state or condition, appa la- is especially frequent in mng. 6: "to release from sorcery, to free from a spell." See also mng. 2; see Josephson, RHA XXV/81 (1967) 129. - b. arha la-: the adverb arha is frequent with active forms of la- in all mngs. It does not appear to change the mng. of the simple la-. See esp. mng. 4 a. - c. piran la-: function unclear. See mng. 8 a 2'. On the adverbs with Ia- see Josephson, RHA XXV/81 (1967) 128-29.
Usually the obj. from which something is loosed is indi- cated by loc. and -kan (1 a, 3, 5, 8 a 1', 8 b), but once by abl. and -kan (6 a). The -kan is not required in the man clause (8 b).

Since one never reads that 1.is eaten, it may
be doubted (with Szab6, FsSalonen 338) that the
translation "fruit"is proper. The context points
to fibers, leaves and stalks of trees or bushes.
Perhaps the choice of 1.to translate Sum. and
Akk. was inexact. For "fruit" a word Sesa- is

pard often accompanies the lagan bar- con- struction when the object is "ear" (parais absent in KUB 24.1 i 16f. and dupl. KUB 24.2 obv. 14 and in KUB 33.68 ii 4) but not with "back". It is probably an adverb rather than a preverb and does not alter the meaning of lak-. If para means "forth", the image may be of ear extended. If it means "forward", the image may be drawn from canine or equid ear movement, i.e. "prick up (or cock) the ears." The fundamental conception is inclining, as Forrer noted (Forsch. 1/2 pp. 183f.), but not just at a 45° angle (Forrer, p. 184)!

7. blade (of knife), ingot (of metal): in Akka- dian texts metal objects designated EME, to be read lifgnu ("tongue"), have been described as either blades or ingots (CAD L 214-15).

There is, however, no evidence that the Hitt. syllabic reading of EME in the meanings "ingot" or "blade" was lala-.

That this section may be dealing with trans- humance rights is suggested (1) by the verb pennanzi "they drive (animals)"; (2) by the listing of :lapanan beside (therefore distinct from) "meadow and sheep pasture"; (3) by the mention of MUN "salt", in this connection apparently a place where the animals may find it. The morphology of some of these Luw. terms is dif- ficult to explain. :lapanaliyanza must be obj., hence Luw. pl.acc. com., although the next clause (-at piyan) refers to a neut. sg. Although LUlapanalli-is a profession, this meaning does not fit :lapanaliyanza here, especially with "given by the king". For the possibility that a noun in -ali-may be synonymous with the basic noun cf. van Brock, RHA XX/71 (1962) 110 sub no. 193. :lapanuwani- may contain the formative -wanni- "the area devoted to summer pasture."

follows the pattern in that it spells the name of
the king with la- in the Hittite version (except GIgKIRI6 SAR.HI.A tuman "all the vegeta- the first line) but with ta- in the Akkadian. In
the 'deeds', however, it is spelled with ta- in both versions. Possibly the scribe of this late manuscript generalized this form because he considered it as the title of the king otherwise known as HattuSili.

In military contexts latti- and its log. denote groups of fighting men characteristic of the KaSka. The log. through its relationship to the

name Sutaeans suggests that these bands were made up of nomads cf. Kupper, Nomades (1957) 83- 145. It is probable that latti- or the log. denoted not just troops, but also the tribe itself. This cannot be established from our limited evidence. As a kind of shorthand, however, we have used
the term "tribe" in our translations.

As a feature of the exta which "looks" (auszi/
uskizzi) the latti-ISUTI "tribe" belongs in the
group which includes KASKAL-NU (KUB 18.11
rev. 6), TEMEg/SU.MES (KUB 18.2 ii 15, KUB 5.10
obv. 18), ZE 6i-lix (GIBIL) (KUB 46.37 obv. 30),
ke(ldis) (KUB 5.1 iv 49), and ta(nanis) (KUB
46.37 obv. 38f.). Like KASKAL, GISgU.A and
keldis, it is a non-anatomical term employed in
extispicies to designate a feature of the exta.

luk(k)atta forms pertinent to the verb, as opposed to the adverb, can be detected only syntactically: verbal luk(k)atta concludes its clause. Therefore luk(k)atta forms followed immediately by explicit marks of clause bound- ary are verbal. Others are treated under the adverb. The adverbial luk(k)atta could be derived from a frozen mid. form. Adverbial luk(k)atti, on the other hand, must be a locative of a noun *luk(k)at-. No clear examples of active forms of luk- have been found in OH or MH. The verb luk- is confined to describing the faint but growing sunlight in the atmosphere at

 luk(k)- B
dawn just before the sun rises. Only once (sub a) does it possibly describe light emitted from a star. Kiimmel's claim, StBoT 3 (1967) 32f., that one should distinguish active lukzi "es wird hell" from mid. lukkatta "es ist hell" and that the latter includes sunrise seems contrary to the available evidence.

KUB 39.8 iii 14, if this is restored correctly. One cannot be positive which of the two forms of this idiom has priority. But it is likely in view of the attestation of ispantan laknu- in the omens and the royal funeral rituals, compositions which may possibly go back to OH or MH prototypes, and ipantan luqqanu- in the cult inventories which are quite late, that the laknu- form is the original. "To make the night fall" was not an obvious choice to later scribes for the idiom which means con- tinuation of daytime activities in the nighttime. So the phrase was transformed to "to make the night light/bright".

As observed by Kiimmel, StBoT 3 (1967) 32f., lukkatta/lukkatti denotes primarily a time of day, namely dawn. Only from the viewpoint of the preceding day does it require the transla- tion "on the morrow, on the following day".
The forms assembled here, which share a common meaning and function (adv.), are apparently of diverse origins. Probably lu(k).

The association of the phrase "experience lulu" with "grow old" - i.e., "live long" - in some treaties, and the passage in Hatt. where the statement "I experienced lulu at the hand of IStar" follows the explanation that HattuSili had been entrusted to that goddess because he was
 :lumpasti-
dying, may be adduced in favor of the trans- lations "recovery" or "survival". Similarly the mid. of the verb luluwai- seems to mean "to be sustained, survive", and may be nearly synony- mous with the idiom lulu aus-. On the other hand, the association of active forms of luluwai- with the near synonym happinahh-"make rich" may be cited in favor of "make prosperous", if simple juxtaposition of the two verbs implies a similar meaning. A more general translation like "good fortune, doing well, thriving" might cover all uses.

The employment of the verb sdi-/siya- with lupanni- characterizes the latter as a type of headdress (Gotze, NBr 77f.). The det. TOG indicates it was made of cloth (once GAD, "linen", KBo 18.186 I.e. 2). According to reliefs, the headdress worn by the king and the Sungod was a round cap. Metal l.'s are men- tioned in descriptions of daggers (swords) and may have been caps (or cappings) on the pommel. The alleged interchange with TUGBAR.SI claimed by Goetze is based on insufficient evidence.

As can be seen from the exx. quoted above, the first
alternative question may or may not be introduced by nu,
while the second one is always so introduced. The -ma is
appended to that element in the second question which is
central in the opposition to the first alternative: e.g., NA 4
... KO.GIma, andurza ... arabzama, idalawafta ...
tepnuttama, IDI ... UL,,ma IDI The -ma serves within
the clauses to focus the attention on the central elements in
the opposition while the nu ... nu or # ... nu conjunctions
relate the juxtaposed clauses. Contrast the indirect double
questions posing the same kind of opposition, where min
introduces both, and -ma does not occur in the second atomu mdSIN-dU-as DUMU mZida maniyab,, clause (see sub man and Friedrich, HE §333).
While it is true that the second clause of a direct double
question posing alternatives seems always to be introduced

He also added kulsan "whenever" (law 28, copy C), which following a suggestion by Gotze (apud Chrest. 226) we have read ku-is!- sa-an (kuisan). In 1925 Ungnad could not have known either that the exx. for this delayed -ma were almost all old. No exx. of madnma (unde- layed -ma) in OS or MS are known to us. Some NH compositions which are formulated in a language inherited from OH or MH prototypes (treaties, festivals or rituals) preserved the de- layed -ma construction alongside the madnma NH innovation. The fact that no exx. of man-,ma have been found in OS or MS, while the same construction is clearly predominating in NH, suggests that the distinction is primarily a dia- chronic one. - 2" in clauses introduced by takku - a" open conditions with present-future tense - 1"' OS: takku nattamm[(a kuitki

b' delayed beyond the second word in its clause: In the construction employed with double questions, discussed above in a 1' b" 4", the -ma is often delayed beyond the second word in its clause, being appended to that element in the second question which is central to the opposi- tion to the first alternative.
c' -ma on the first accented word of the clause and man later in the clause: andama,,zkan man LJKUR-a kuwdpi uwalhiuwanzidai KBo 16.50:

na man ZI-anza esta KUB 14.7 i 20-21 (Hatt. III).
The essential function of -ma (from OH/OS) is to mark a correlation, either between single words or phrases within adjacent clauses (usage a), or between entire clauses (b). The anaphoric use (d) is merely a specialization of this func- tion, in which the repetition of the key word is highlighted by transposition to the head of the clause and marked by -ma. The paragraph- introducing, continuative use (e) is an extension of the series-marking use seen in a 1' a' KUB 24.8 iv 13-18. It is clear from its use relating two main clauses (b 1'-4'), two dependent clauses (b 5'), a dependent clause with a following main clause (b 6'), and the members of a series of paragraphs (e) that -ma does not function to mark either subordination or coordination, but merely a correlation between words, clauses or paragraphs regardless of their dependent or in- dependent status.

The proposed translation is based on the fact that the speaker wishes that unpleasant or evil things (anger(?), kallar-) should do this. We therefore separate this word from the verb maskiske- "to give presents".

The position of madhanda q.v. and m. in their clauses requires comment.
mahhanda, which occurs in OH with the same mng. as mahhan 2, is clause initial nine out of ten times. The exception is mdnhandain KBo 25.112 ii 14 (OS).
In mng. 1 mahhan always follows the compared word and does not determine its case.
In mngs. 2, 3, and 4 the subject of the clause usually either precedes mahhan or is expressed by an enclitic pron. appended to m. Rarely only
a part of the phrase constituting the subject may precede m. (e.g., tuel mabban SAG.DU-KA,
gimras GIM-an SISKUR.SISKUR).
In mng. 5 (temporal usage) m. is usually (80-90%) clause initial. It can be preceded by nu

because they are emphatic, have an anaphoric function, or introduce a new subject. Cf. Gdtze,
Hatt. 122 s.v. GIM-an.
In mng. 6 the subject, if one is expressed,

The verb mai- essentially describes growth. When the process is viewed in its final stages, as it is in the intransitive participles (LO)mayant- and miyant-, it may require the English transla- tion "mature", "ripe", "fruit-bearing".
The stems mai- and miya- are attested already in OS. mai- is used exclusively in the act; miya- is used in the mid. (including mid. iter.). The
stem miegs- is first unambiguously attested in NS, and can be confused with its homograph miess- "to be soft, mild, gentle". The form ma- is-te-en KBo 8.35 ii 15 (MS) offers no evidence for a stem maig-, but is like paisti"you give" (pai-) and naisteni"you (pl.) turn/ send" (nai-).

The m.'s seem to be attachments to the object

that Akk. magarruwas borrowed as *magarri- into Hitt. as a specialized word for "chariot wheel" alongside burki- "wheel (in general)". The city name URUMa-kar-wa-an-da KUB 31.44 i7 cited by Laroche may not after all contain this word. Even if the interpretation "wheels" proves
wrong, there is nothing in KUB 34.89 rev. 3-5 to suggest plants. Thus it would be difficult to explain URUMakarwanda on the basis of the objects mentioned in KUB 34.89.

The word describes animals which are abnormally thin due either to a lack of food or to an emaciating disease. More than simply the lack of special fattening seems implied in several passages. Their inferior status, as compared to healthy cattle, is clear from the prohibition against exchanging them with those fattened for temple sacrifice. From KUB 13.4 iv 28 it is clear that the man who claimed that "It died from maklatar"thought this was an acceptable excuse for not returning livestock belonging to the temple. See maklatar.

In fact, the structure of lines 25-27 is the same as lines 31-32: nasta ANA LJ.MES arha ... da nat INA URUHatti uda ANA SAL.ME -makan arha ... da natkan ANA KUR URUUatti istarna uda. Since GISTUKUL.HI.A begins a list of objects, the "and" after mal is understandable as connecting it with the preceding physical conditions.

On the nature of Zawalli rituals cf. Archi, AOF 6:81ff., who, however, does not treat the entire passage.

KUB 49.98 ii(?) 8.
mal in KBo 2.9 i 25-27 (usage a) is a quality possessed by fighting men and by virtue of which they pose a threat. To "know" this quality for oneself (usage b) may be a way of saying that one possesses it (i.e., to know something for oneself is to experience it). But the expression may also have the force of recognizing the quality in another (e.g., in an opponent). The passage cited in c demonstrates that this quality could be lost,
 mila
and that it could be restored through a ritual. Only in KUB 33.62 (usage d) does it alternate in the same construction with IM-as and GI~amama, words denoting concrete objects.

A connection with the Hurrian offering term maiT considered possible by Beckman (Diss. 190f.) and seemingly favored by the Hurr. terms
following in obv. 8-9 (namma uziya zurki[ya] sipan[ti]) and following rev. 6 in rev. 9, is unlikely because of the different ending (-a versus -i) and mala's construction with Hitt. genitives. Identification with the noun mal, deemed "likely" by Beckman (Diss. 191), can be neither proven nor disproven.

Of the latter possibility he excluded the commonly occurring
GISTUKUL in favor of Ehelolf's proposal that GISTUKUL = hatanti-. He tentatively favored an equation with the Sumerogram GIR "dagger" and restored Akk. ina patri in Akk. vers. at i 28. But this passage is much more unclear than the editors admitted.

(If any land turns away from me, or if any lords defect from me, and you join them, claiming they forced you,-don't do it!) § nasmatzik :ma(coll.)-li-siasimankanZAG[-as' GAM-an?] niyarinasma,, <m> anwakan unius EN.MEg :alla[ll]pdnzi Cqqamanwa phbu. danzi nat Ie 'anfti 3S-anta ZAG-as s[du] "Or (if) you contemplate it: 'That province might turn (i.e., change its allegiance), or those lords might defect and take me away with them'-Don't try it! Let death be your boundary!" KBo 4.14 ii 78-81 (treaty of Supp. II), ed. Stefanini, AANL 20:43f., comments on p. 65 ("prendere in considerazione... queste (ipotesi): '.. . potrebbe . . . ' "); ikmawa<r>an[. .. -a]t UL :ma!-li-wis "But I will not contemplate it" ibid. iv 33-34 in broken context; collation showed :ku-, but one should probably emend to :ma-.
In the paragraph KBo 4.14 ii 73-76 a rebellious province and rebellious lords force the vassal to join their faction. Despite the excuse that "They forced me" the vassal is held accountable for his complicity. In the following paragraph KBo 4.14 ii 77-81 he is held accountable for even entertaining fears regarding the danger to him if certain lands or lords should rebel and carry him off. The interpretation of the crucial verb :malisi
depends upon the interpretation of the ,,man clauses. If they are examples of the speaker optative (cf. man usage al') to be translated "Would that ... " or "I wish that. .. ", it is conceivable that the vassal is himself planning rebellion, or even proposing it to others. If, however, the vman clauses are potential and to be translated ". . . might . . . " (Stefanini's "potrebbe"), then the vassal can only be entertaining thoughts about threats posed to his safety and contemplating action along the lines of least danger (i.e., desertion if it becomes necessary). Favoring the latter interpretation is the phrase "Let death be your limit (ZAG-al)", which concludes this pericope. This phrase occurs elsewhere in this text only in those
(:)maliyagba-
situations where the vassal is tempted to abandon the Hittite king through outside threat or invasion (ii 23, 29, 61). It seems to have been similar in force to LUGAL-i GAM-an ik "Give your life for the king!" (ii 65) and is inappropriate to a situation in which the vassal is conceived as fomenting a rebellion.
In spite of the phonetic similarity to malai-"to approve" and the possibility of translating these passages as "If you approve it (i.e., the rebellion or foreign invasion)", we must keep this verb apart from malai- because of the marker wedge and the absence of -za, which is obligatory for the finite forms of malai- (cf. malai- usage a).
According to Starke (KZ 93:251 n. 18-19) two participles of this verb are attested: an older one ma!-li-im-ma-as-si(-wa) in the broken Luw. context KUB 35.79 iv 9, and a younger one :maldimi- in KUB 40.80 obv. 19. The latter, being in a Hittite context, occupies its own lemma above in this dictionary.

StBoT 18:45. Laroche (Priere hittite 11) translated "il l'a proclame/voue ainsi", although what follows is neither a proclamation nor a vow, but a ritual performed for the deity. Also against the tr. "vowed" is the absence of -za. Note also that in the colophon KUB 7.20 rev. 4 what immediately follows nan kisan is not mald-, as in the opening lines of the ritual, but a word beginning with i[s- or another sign of similar shape; perhaps read i[§fai]?
Since the text is a purification ritual which includes offerings, and since according to the colophon the king re- erected the god (dan sard [tittanut] KUB 7.20 rev. 3), it is conceivable that the ritual was meant to fulfill a vow to replace the previous statue. A tentative rendering might be: "He provided him (the deity) with offerings/a ritual in fulfillment of a vow."

adj.; obliged to make a maltessar(?);
The text KBo 8.68 is a Kizzuwatnean ritual.
The context which concerns the m. person is
badly broken and difficult to restore or inter-
pret. It appears that the m. person has not made
the required maltessar: man ma-al-ta-al-lis malte(sa)nala- adj.; recipient of maltessar UN-ag [maltesar(?) U-UL] kuitki iyat (i? 6-7).
The ritual's purpose seems to be the purification
of certain rooms or buildings (E.ME9, i? 2 and
10), as well as the purification of the m. man himself through a statuette(?) of wax which is placed at his feet (i? 12-14). The bread and the
libation cup are placed upside down (i? 15-17). m. is an adj. in -alli-, always used attributively with the noun UN-a- (=antuha-)"person". m. seems to be derived from the verb mald- "to recite, vow; treat (a deity) with a ritual". It hardly denotes a "reciting person" as the title of a functionary, since no other functionary is designated by an adj. + antubha-. Since maltesar can designate an offering, and the verb mald- once describes the treating of a god with a purification ritual (cf. mald- mng. 3), it seems likely that the m. person is one obliged to
make such an offering; cf. 34/p:1-3 cited under SISKURmantalli- b 3'.

KBo 22.242 + 1003/z ii 5-7 (NH), restored also in iii 5, 9. Since the gift of the elders has been described in full, it cannot be meant by the maltef~ar. Yet what is provided for the king on his visit is probably not a recitation, but either an offering or a ritual of some kind.
The variant maltesnas for SISKUR.SISKUR. HI.A-as in the prayer of Arn. and Am. (cf. HW
3.Erg. 23) cannot be used to prove that m. is the normal reading of SISKUR.SISKUR. This logogram is used in Hittite for both "offering" and "ritual". The definition of SISKUR.SISKUR as "magisches Ritual" (HW2 85) is much too narrow. Beside the alternation of SISKUR. SISKUR with maltessar there is also an alternation with mu-ke[-es-sar] KUB 30.51 obv. 11 and dupl. KBo 14.68 obv. 8 (Otten, MDOG 93:77 n. 5). Additionally, LImukisnas EN-as KBo 14.86 i 7, L jmukisnas(-pat) ihaJs KBo 12.19 ii 12 (KuliwiSna rits.) is likely to be a reading of EN.SISKUR (cf. Otten, MDOG 93.77 n. 5).

mugessar could be a ritual (including offerings
and words) aimed at invoking the gods,
maltessar, a ritual performed in fulfilment of a

maltesnas parkuyannas uddani of the newer

In Hierogl. Luw. the verb LITUUS-na- seems to mean "see", "behold", "regard" (Hawkins and Starke, Kadmos 19:123ff.). The Hierogl. Luw. verb LITUUS.LITUUS-na-i in its one occurrence (ibid. 136), "He who fears this god, he too shall behold his benefit here," may be freely paraphrased "he too shall receive his benefit here" (cf. below). According to Starke (ibid. 142ff.), LITUUS-na- represents cuneiform Luw. mand-"sehen, erleben", and LITUUS.LITUUS- na- cuneiform Luw. ma(m)manna- "schauen", although the second is not a reduplicated form of the first (ibid. 147, contra 137). To the Luw. text dUTU-waz dKamrusepai daueyan ma-am-ma[- an-na-at-ta] zdniwa kuwati "The Sungod... -ed toward Kamrugepa: 'How is this?'" (KUB 35.107 iii 8-9) he adduces parallels from the Hittite version of this same text, showing ... austa inimawa kuit "looked ... , (saying:) 'What is that?"' KBo 12.89 iii 10 (ibid. 146). Starke also cites the Hittite passage KUB 24.12 ii 28-30 and iii 4-5 as examples of :mamanna-"schauen".
In the prayer-incantations to the infernal deities with regard to the substitutes (tarpalli-), two consecutive imperatives are used: "X these substitutes, but Y the sacrificer." In all the other exx. X and Y are virtual antonyms: da- "take" vs. (arha) tarna- "release", nuwa ki~ akkandu

Enclitic -man was suffixed to the first word of
(-wa, -mu, -nas, -kan, -asta). The word mamman (MS), mdnman (NH) contains the conj. "if" and the particle man in that order, ma-a-am-ma- an KUB 30.10 obv. 22 (OH?/ MS), ma-am-ma-an-za-

StBoT 3:112f., 119). The conj. "if" is occasionally
written ma-an or ma-na-, and the particle written ma-a-an or ma-a-na-. The particle is often enclitic, while the conj. "if" is never enclitic. Exx. of man + man as a single word compound were unknown to Friedrich in 1930 (KIF 289f.), when he maintained on the basis of plene vs. nonplene writings that the particle always preceded the conj. in the non-compounded exx. such as ma- an-kin ma-a-an (KUB 6.41 iv 28, KUB 14.1 i 12), ma- a-an-khn ma-a-an (KBo 5.8 iii 15), ma-a-an ma-a-an (KUB 14.3 ii 16), and even (in Korrektur- nachtrag) "ma-a?-an ma-an" (KUB 21.38 i 44), actually wr. as one word; cf. also ma-an ma-a- an KUB 33.117 ii 7, (10), KUB 19.55 rev. 9, KBo 9.85:22. The existence of analogous takkuman (2' a'), however, where it is clear that "if" precedes the particle, and of the compound mammdn, where it is highly unlikely that the "if" conj. is enclitic to the particle, suggests that the plene vs. nonplene contrast is an unsatisfactory basis for determining the sequence particle + conj. Even in the exx. cited by Friedrich where the particle and conj. are written as two separate words, it is likely that the conj. precedes.
Giuterbock (OrNS 12:154) pointed out that, as in other IE languages, the optative and potential are expressed in Hittite by a common morpheme. In Hittite that morpheme is man. It would appear that the optative usage of man is attested in the earliest texts, and that the irrealis usage demonstrated in b 1' grew out of the optative usage of a 2' b'. In fact one could equally well translate many exx. in b 1'as "so-and-so wanted to do such-and-such, but... " The usages under b share most with a 2'. The negative of a 1' (speaker optative) is expressed by Ie and man, while the negative of a 2' (subject optative) would seem to be expressed by numan/nuwan

g. man and takku in the Laws and in omen protases - 1' In the Laws: "If" introducing a law is always takku, from OS mss. to the late version, KBo 6.4. man is used only in con- ditional clauses inside a law; for exx., including
one in OS, see mng. 7 a-b.
2' In omens: Most omen protases begin with takku. Here, too, man may occur in the interior of a paragraph. At the beginning of an omen,
533.12, 13 (KUB 34.10 with dupls. and KUB 34.11); in the mixed omens KBo 13.29 (CTH 544.2); in the physiognomic omens KUB 43.8 (CTH suppl. 543.3) with [B]E-an rev. 9, probably also KUB 43.9 (CTH suppl. 543.4) with [ma-a-a]n-za-kdn in lines 7, 9; in the text of iqqur Tpus type, KUB 8.35 (CTH 545 II). Both takku and man are found in CTH 535.2 with takku in B = KUB 8.25 i 7 and ma-a-an-sa-an in A = KUB 8.22 ii 6; and in the liver omens CTH 549 b and c (KUB 8.34 + KUB 43.13, KBo 10.7). In KUB 8.28 (CTH 535.4) only the colophon uses man, against takku in the text, apparently a modernization by the copyist.

9. man in incipits (incl. colophons and catalog entries), "when"/"if": In rituals which prescribe means for counteracting or remedying certain conditions in persons, the man clause is to be understood as conditional, e.g. ma-a-an antu,- wahhba alwanzabbanza nan kissan aniyami "If a person is bewitched, I treat him as follows" KUB 11.12 i 1-2 (rit. of Alli), ed. THeth 2:20f. and passim. We found no OS rituals beginning with man "if". In MH/MS we .noted KUB 32.115 i 1 (2Mat.). Further exx. in MH/NS are KUB 12.34 i 2 (IMaSt.) and KBo 12.107 rev. 19 (colophon of rit. of Mast. to expiate murder). For conditional man from MS on see mng. 7 above.
In other types of rituals, man must be understood as temporal, e.g. in the rituals for the construction of buildings: ma-a-an INA E.GAL- LIM GIBIL hattalwas GIS-ru tittanuwanzi
foundations" KUB 2.2 ii 36 (colophon, NH); in KUB 29.1 i 1(OH/NS), the verb wetezzi demands the restoration of[mn ... ], cf. ibid. iii 13 (see Kellerman, Diss. 25, 32); in other rits.: ma-a-an LO-an LU.dU-nili aniyami "When(ever) I treat a man in the manner of a 'Man of the Stormgod"' KUB 7.57 iv 2-3 + KUB 35.148 iv 26-27 (colophon of the rit. of Zuwi, NS), for a possible OH origin of this rit., incl. OS exemplars, see Neu, StBoT 25, p. 23.
In festival texts, which describe regularly recurring rites, the man clause in the incipit/ colophon must be temporal, not conditional, e.g. ma-a-an LUGAL-ug URUArinna ANA EZEN nuntaryalba [p]aizzi"When(ever) the king goes to Arinna for the n.-festival" KUB 2.9 vi 5-8, ma-a-an LUGAL SAL.LUGAL [1]ahaza uwan[zi] "When(ever) the king and queen return from a voyage" KUB 25.14 vi 2-3, etc.
It has long been observed that some archaic features in NS festival texts point to an early date of the original composition. The OS festival texts (in StBoT 25) confirm the early existence of the genre. The temporal function of man was preserved in festival incipits through NH. A dated late ex. is: ma-a-an-za (var. adds [tab]ar, nag) m Tudhaliya LUGAL.GAL... dU URUHatti INA GIS.HI.A GISTUG tarnui maninkuwan EZEN.AN.TAH.SUMSAR hame<()>hi DU-zi (var. iyazi) "When(ever) (the Tabarna) T., the great king (with full title and genealogy of Tudb. IV) performs the A. festival for the Stormgod of H. in the box grove near the bath house in the spring" KUB 20.63 + KUB 11.18 i 1-10, w. dupl. KUB 20.42 i 1-9, cf. the undated parallel KUB 11.22 vi 1-5.

(:)mannai(m)mi- according to its formation should be the participle of a Luw. verb *mannai-. The verb mand- "to see" (q.v.) is known (Starke, Kadmos 19:142ff.), but its parti- ciple should be *mand(m)mi-. To ignore this spelling distinction and translate the participle (:)mannai(m)mi-as "seen, visible, conspicuous" does not materially clarify its contexts.

proposed that niman was the negative for the "subject optative" construction of man (q.v.); its occurrence here with manqa reinforces the impression gained from the exx. cited above under a 1' that this adverb had a particular appro- priateness to clauses involving the optative/potential/unreal particle man.

If one rejects Sommer's tr. "with respect to one's self" in favor of "in some way" (negated "in no way"), one is faced with the question: "How does UL manka differ in meaning from UL kuitki or UL kuwatka?" No sure answer can be given yet. But if there is more than mere coincidence in the frequent association of manka with the particle man and the negative numan, there might be a hint of the optative, potential or unreal ideas in its contexts.

the m.-ritual was performed in Arzawa dif- ferently from in Hatti.
The m. ritual was performed to heal an estrangement or antagonism between two people, one of whom was usually deceased. The position of the marker wedges before SISKUR in KUB 16.32 ii 14 suggests that SISKUR was not a logogram, but a determinative. But even if the SISKUR is a determinative and m. a substantive, the semantic connection of NH SISKURmantalli-to the MH adj. mantalli- is likely. For the desig- nation of a SISKUR by a word denoting the evil to be removed compare marsaya SISKUR (cf. marsi- adj.).

Both the miri- and the GI'UKUR are weapons of the spear type. Of English words available (spear, pike, javelin, lance) we have avoided "lance", because it suggests a weapon used from horseback. There is no evidence from texts that either the mdri- or the GISgUKUR were hurled (javelin). Indeed, in texts, no evidence has been found which might point to the military use of either. A pike is a particularly long thrusting spear held with two hands. The word "spear", although it can denote a thrusting weapon, is the least specific of the available terms. Until concrete evidence is available we think it best to refer to these as "miri-spear"and "SUKUR- spear". One reading of GISgUKUR was turi- (Sommer, ZA 46:24ff.; Laroche, OLZ 1959:276; Popko, Kultobjekte 103f.), but the complementation GISSUKUR-an (acc. sg.) in Hittite Law 101 indicates another reading. The GIsturi- is once used figuratively "to thrust forth, expel" (pard suwai-) the "portentous thing" (kallar uttar) (KBo 4.2 i 69-70). This could indicate that the turi- was used for thrusting or prodding, if the figure of speech in the ritual reflects the actual use of the weapon. In the idol description (usage b 1') the god dLAMMA holds a miri- in his right hand and a shield in his left. For examples of standing gods in the attacking posture with shield in the left hand and spear (or javelin?) in the upraised right hand see Helga Seeden, The Standing Armed Figurines in the Levant, Pra- historische Bronzefunde, Abteilung I, Band I, Miunchen, 1980, plates 112-116. The weapons have been lost from the Divlek statuette (Bittel, Die Hethiter, figure 149), but it probably held a shield in the left hand and a spear in the upraised right hand. Other artistic representations of gods and kings show them with a long spear in one hand but never a shield in the other: cf. Bittel, Die Hethiter, figures 182, 183, 185, 201, 202, 203, 207, 239. This
(NINDA)miri-
longer spear might be the turi- or GISUKUR. Note especially the longer spear used in Bittel, figure 182, to fight a lion at close quarters without a shield; and compare with this the GISSUKUR which the hunter Ke§§i takes when he sets out with his dogs to go lion hunting (KUB 33.121 ii 11).

If the heat of emotion, passion or anger is indicated by this adv., one might compare the

Interpreting the word as Akk. setu 'light' also gives a possible sense (cf. Riemschneider, OrNS 40:477) and allows one to connect the Hittite counterpart with the verb marra-, marriye- "to melt" and the adverb marri "rashly(?), heatedly(??)".

Regardless of the correct reading of the Sum. and Akk. columns, it is unclear how the Hittite scribe understood (and therefore translated) the ambiguously spelled Akkadian word.

The LO.MESTJG are usually thought to be fullers. The situation reflected in the KUB 27.67 passages might be the cleaning of linen prior to dyeing. The "chamberlains" in KBo 13.109 may function as overseers of the closets and storerooms, where items not in use (including clothing) are kept. Clothing must be cleaned before it is put away. Whatever impurities attach to clothes and keep them from looking harki- "white" could be meant. The determinative SIG "hair, wool" suggests "fuzz" or "lint". The word may be Luwian, as suggested by the gloss marker in KBo 13.109 ii 8. Cf. Luwian ma-ra-ah-si-wa-li- is KUB 25.39 iv 5 and DLL 68 (mar(a)hsi-"sorte de laine").

While we do not wish to rule out Friedrich's equation of marmarr(a)-with GIsmammarr[i(-) ... ], the forms have been kept separate because the latter has no r in the first syllable, because its context within the missing god myth is different from marmarr(a)-, and because it bears the determinative GIS. Terms for terrain, such as gimra-, wellu-, and luliya&ga-, do not bear the det. GI. However in support of Friedrich, cf. warhuessarwithout GIS and ties'ar with GIS, both apparently meaning "forest". Otten's tr. "Moor" (Eng. "swamp, marsh") depends on his tr. of balenzu- as a kind of algae, "duckweed" or the like. (HGG prefers alenzu- = "foliage".)

as giving the dimensions of the house, if -at "it" refers back to E-er "house". marnan and hastai ("bone") could be units of linear measure. bastai
probably translates Akk. esemtu, which in Neo- Assyrian texts is a subdivision (probably 2/ 3) of a cubit (Postgate, Fifty Neo-Assyrian Legal Documents 71). This would make the house 6 cubits wide. But if marnan were a unit of measure, it should have a number before it. Since it doesn't, we might regard it as an object of known height used as a comparison ("You made it as high as a m."). In such a clause the postpositional matban (cf. nan GISAN.ZA.GAR GIM-an parganusi KUB 24.7 ii 11) might be understood. In all other respects the construction is the same. Since in this proverb we do not know if the proportions of the father's house are supposed to be ridiculous, leading to the question "But what did you obtain?" (Akk.), we cannot use the width (6 cubits) of the house to predict its height (and therefore the height of a marnan). Since the semantic connection with the glossed :marnan B is unclear, we have kept the two entries separate and do not wish to exclude the possibility of reading GIsmenan or of accepting the mng. "doorleaf" for it.

Friedrich and von Schuler in interpreting marnu(w)an as nom.-acc. neuter of the stem marnu(w)ant-, although by 1971 Otten knew of the two occurrences of marnuwandan (sg. com. acc.). The form marnu(w)an served as both subject of intransitive verbs (nom.) and object of transitive ones (acc.), which points to a neuter of either marnuwa- or marnuwant-. But since the marnuwandanforms show that marnuwant-was com. gender, we assume that the neut. mar,, nu(w)an forms belong to the stem marnuwa-. It was the stem marnu(w)ant-which was taken up
into the Old Assyrian marnuatum.

The overwhelming majority of occurrences of this beverage name occur either in OS texts or in
194
cultic texts in the OH tradition (mostly OH/NS). The very few exx. which may be NH rather than OH/NS are in texts dealing with aliments necessary to celebrate festivals and rites which continue the OH (almost
always Hattian influenced) religious traditions. The religious texts represented by the references cited above are those classified by Laroche as CTH 323 (The missing Sungod), 415, 612, 627, 633, 646, 648-9, 671, 674, 676, 681, 725, 730, 732, 739, all with evidence of Hattic religious and often linguistic influence. The word does not occur in religious
texts relating primarily to Hurrian deities.
Von Schuler, AOAT 1:317, has pointed out that marnuatum in the Old Assyrian texts from Cappadocia is the same word as Hittite
marnuwan, marnuwant-. Since this marnuatum was made from a cereal (CAD M 1:284), it was probably a kind of beer. It then makes sense, as Singer, Diss. 263, has pointed out, that marnuwan was distributed not by the LUZABAR. DAB, who distributed wine, but by the LUAGRIG, who distributed the other beverages.
The spellings without the glide -wa- are predominantly found in texts of OS and MS, whereas those with the glide are usually in NS texts.
Friedrich, HW 137 posited two stems, marnu- and marnuwant-, the latter neuter. No form, however, requires the stem marnu-. Von Schuler,

According to its formation marnuwala-is an adj. in -ala-, derived from marnu-/mernu-, "to cause to vanish". For another ex. of a derivative in -ala- based on a -nu- caus. cf. arnuwala-"resettled person", from arnu- "to transport". Thus, "the road which makes (things) disappear" or "the road which has been made invisible", (for the latter see KBo 13.101 rev. 14- 15, treated s.v. mer- and mernu-).

Two areas of meaning can be ascertained in Hittite words based on the root *mars-: (1) profaneness, unholiness, and (2) deceitfulness, dishonesty. Both meanings are attested for marsa-, margabb-, marganu-, and marsess-. marsastarri- has only meaning (1), while marsant-, marsatar and marse- have only meaning (2). The two meanings probably derive from a common source, but we do not know what that was. According to Laroche, RHA X/51:23-25, it was the notion of falseness. The second meaning proposed for marsant-, "unfit, poor (quality)" (describing a cow), may derive from "deceptive", meaning that in the spring the cow looks better than she really is.

The earlier identification of ID.SA 5 "Red River" with IDMaraSlanta (the Classical "Halys", Turkish "Kizil Irmak") was first proposed by
Forrer, SPAW 1919:1039, and advocated sub- sequently by Giuterbock, JCS 10 (1956) 116 note b. On the basis of this equation one proposed SA 5 "red" = *marasaa- = Luw. mar(r)usfa-, related to the Luw. v. "to redden" (cf. Oettinger, Stammbildung 385). This equation must now be given up on the basis of nu ID.SA5 AN[A]' IDMarassandakuedanipidi anda imm [i]Skittari "In the place where the Red River mixes with (i.e., flows into) the Mara§§anda River" KBo 23.27 ii 28-29, cf. KBo 12.94:3-5, cf. Otten, StBoT 17 (1973) 21f. With the collapse of the equation one must now cautiously reassess contextual evidence. Even the inner Luw. connection of marwa(i)- to marusa- should be viewed with skepticism. It is highly probable that the words marwai- (adj.), marwai- (v.), maruwammi- (part. of marwai-), and mar(r)uwabza-are derived from the same root. If, as Laroche (DLL 69) suggests, marusa- is iter. of the verb marru-/ maruwai-, one could associate the part. :marusam(m)e- with the above words. Two problems confront this solution. What would be the sense in the iter. here (cf. on :maruSam(m)e-)? And, how can one explain the form marusaasv in IBoT 1.31 i 16,

We can say then that the group of Luwian and Hittite words related to marwai-could denote a color. But it is not yet possible to identify that
color. 201

KUB 8.38 + KUB 44.63 iii 10-17 (medical rit.), ed. StBoT 19:30ff.; Burde here assumes that what is brought from Cyprus is a reddish mineral, perhaps copper-bearing. With the collapse of the ID.SAs = iDMaraSSanta equation (see disc. s.v. marwai-, adj.) there remains no compelling reason to translate m. as "redness" or "red substance". Cyprus was famous for copper, but all copper salts even in dilute solutions are known to attack mucous membranes (the tissue surrounding the eyes). The unima (11) shows that the m. in 10 is also the mineral, not "redness" as a condition of the eyes. But if so, does line 10 contain one clause or two? Does the sufferer lack tears, iyauwan and the medicine marruwalha-? Then [0-UL bar-zi] would have to be restored on the right edge. Or should one read the line nasmag<si>itbabru iya[uwa]n marruwabhan[-ma L- UL harzi] "(The patient) has tears and i.; but he has no m."? No solution is totally satisfactory. Since nammalf[i] in line 12 begins a new clause, and temporal mahban is normally not delayed to the end of its clause, we have interpreted maiban as comparative and associated it with the preceding verb a[rnuan]zi"they bring

Although the inflection of this verb resembles that of ed- and ispart-, and Friedrich, HW 139, entered it under the stem mat-, no form of the verb has a t, even in forms where it might have been expected (e.g., mazzuwa' and mazzuweni). The reading ma-t[e-er] KBo 3.13 (=BoTU 3) obv. 18 (Gilterbock, ZA 44:70f., 75, Oettinger, Stammbildung 208) is highly questionable from the traces in BoTU 3 and KBo 3.13. Contrast the trace after ma- with the te sign in line 21. The ma-du found in KUB 30.10 rev. 6 certainly is not this verb, cf. ma- v. We have concluded therefore that the stem was maz(z)-.

differences between "your (-Smi-)", "their" (-smi-) and "our" (-ummi-) were too slight for a proper differentiation. But it is equally possible that, when the scribe wrote, the enclitic forms for the plural had been replaced by the gen. of the independent personal pronoun, while the enclitic forms for the singular were still in use. It may be, therefore, that the use of sumenzan, apenzan and anzel in non-contrasting attributive situations began earlier than the non-contrasting use of ammel, tuel and apel.
oi.chicago.edu
The genitive forms of the independent per-
sonal pronoun (the -el/-enzan forms) are
required in all periods of Hittite to express
a predicate (". .. is/was mine", ".. .is/was
yours"). But their use in attributive position in
OH and MH expresses contrast ("mine [not
yours or his]"), while the enclitic form (-mi-,
-tir, -si-, etc.) serves as the non-contrasting possessive is well known (Friedrich, HE § 205). attributive possessive.
Whereas the enclitic possessive pronoun has a wide use in OH and MH texts (including NS copies), its use in original NH compositions is restricted to text types with an OH or MH tradition (prayers, rituals, festivals, myths, treaties, vocabularies). Even in these traditional texts its use is sparing. In NH treaty texts only one example of -mi- (kattimi) occurs in the Suppiluliuma I-Hukkana treaty and one -si- (pedissi) in the Murgili II-DuppiteSup treaty. Furthermore, in the NH occurrences there are differences in vocalization and inflection (see further below). In NH, examples of the non- contrasting attributive use of the -el/-enzan forms are fairly common, e.g., mahhanmaza mM6iwatallisapelSES-SU DINGIR-LIM-igkisat "But when his brother Muwatalli became a god" KUB 21.27 i 38-39 (prayer of Pud.), Itwa dTelepinun anzel EN-NI DINGIR-LAM SA SAG.DU-NI mugdi "Go, invoke Telepinu, our lord, the god of our person(s)!" KUB 24.1 i 5-7 + 1122/v + 217/w (prayer of Mur. II), translit. Otten/Rtister, ZA 62:232. This shows that the NH -el/-enzan forms had assumed some functions of the OH and MH enclitic possessives. In the paradigm of possessives found in KBo 1.42 i 23-28 the three singular forms "my", "your" and "his/her" are expressed by the enclitic possessive, while the plural forms "your", "their" and "our" are expressed by the gen. of the independent per- sonal pronoun (sumenzan, apenzan, anzel). Why did the scribe not use the enclitics through- out? It is possible that the phonetic or graphic
Gotze (AM 310 sub -si "D. an Stelle eines Poss.") once listed examples in the MurSili annals where the dat. pron. -i expresses the poss. relationship. A replacement of poss. -tis "your" in an OH prayer by -ta "to you" in NH can be seen by comparing nu bannesnas pv di dariyabhastis NU.GAL KUB 31.127 i 24-25 +KUB 36.79 (Sun hymn, OH/NS) with nu,,tta bannesnaspedi tarriyashas NU.GAL KUB 24.3 i 48 (prayer, MurI II), ed. Gtiter- bock, AnSt 30:46, cf. idem, Frontiers 138. If the enclitic possessive continued in general use in NH, it is difficult to explain those NH texts in which its forms are so badly misused (e.g., KBo 22.6). Cf. also Starke, StBoT 23.189-91 on the misuse of -Summi. If it was no longer a part of the spoken language and was only used in making copies of older texts or in composing traditional texts in an archaic style, it is easy to understand that NH scribes would have found it difficult to use correctly. The situation is similar to the attempts to use OH uk in late NH.
The question of how the Akk. possessive suffixes were read in NH is a difficult one. There is no direct proof available. One can only draw tentative conclusions based upon indirect evidence. It would be circular reasoning to assume that the Akk. poss. suffixes were read either ammel or -mi- and then use that evidence to confirm a particular theory. Until the rules governing usage in the NH period are estab- lished based upon the unequivocal evidence of the syll. writings one may not make any assumptions about the reading of the Akkado- graphic examples. The remarks in the preceding
222
That the dative occasionally expresses the
 in examples of -mi- and the assumption of its functions by the -el/-enzan forms and the datives in NH. They do not show that the enclitic poss. was completely replaced, but rather that it was considerably restricted.
In some cases the Akk. poss. might still be read -mi-, if confusion would otherwise result. Thus in KBo 4.4 i 45 (AM 112) SA ABI-YA (= attas1ma') ammella lingaus "The oaths of my father and me", if read ammel attas ammella lingaus, might have caused confusion, since the two ammel's function on different syntactic levels.
From this evidence we conclude that, while the question is still an open one, it is likely that the usual NH means of expressing non- contrasting possession was either with the -elf-enzan forms or with the dative. The enclitic possessive pronoun (-mi-, etc.) was used only in NS texts with an earlier tradition, in cases like KBo 4.4 i 45 (AM 112) where confusion might result from the use of the -el -enzan form, and possibly in very common set expressions like attas-mis "my father" (esp. in DS) and pedissi.
In MH a new vocalization of the sg. acc. com. (-min, etc.) replaced the older vocalization -man, -san, etc. Beginning in NH, forms occur in which the case endings of the noun and the enclitic possessive do not agree (e.g., attagmin KUB 14.11 ii 22, attastin KUB 31.66 ii 25). In KBo 12.70 the scribe writes the vocative atti-me (iii 10), the acc. sg. com. attitten (= attinten?, ii 6), and the gen. sg. adda r da (ii 9).

HAB 103 n. 2 O since "old women" are included with the men, it is probably better not to regard the LU.MES.gU.GI as the political body of adult men called "elders" but simply elderly men and women as objects of respect and pity; in KBo 4.4 iv 31-32 (AM 138f.) and KBo 5.8 iv 11-12 (AM 160f.), however, the LO.ME. 9U.GI alone are an embassy of "elders" in the political sense (cf. mng. 3); so understood by Klengel, ZA 57:229f. and von Schuler, KaSkier 72, but cf.

HG 40f.; since the pl. ending -as in OS is highly unlikely as a nom., we follow Hrozny (CH p. 61), Walther (HC p. 259), Neufeld (HL 23) and von Schuler (TUAT l:108f.) in interpreting the form as dat. pl. The form is translated as nom. pl. by Goetze (ANET), Friedrich (HG), and Imparati (Leggi). Since the form is dat., one cannot claim that the elders assign the stray, but merely attest that the finder has attempted to locate the owner. His custody and use of the animal could follow automatically upon his notifying the authorities. So contra Klengel, ZA 57:231 ("die dann entscheiden").

Otten ZA 50:231-34 has shown that SAL. SU.GI, the "Old Woman" who is a magical expert, is to be read SALhSawa-. There is no proof that LU.MES.SU.GI, when it denotes not just a group of old men but "elders, aldermen
(as a body having political, religious and judicial functions)", was read as the pl. of miyahhuwant-. But since the word(s) for "old men" designated such groups in other ancient
societies (cf. Akk. sTbi2tu, Hebrew zaqenim and Greek rtpscop6Trpot), it is possible that it did so in Hatti.

returning in the spring; "birds of the season" would express this notion. The dative pron. -gi "for/to him," which can only refer to the king, would imply that the birds return in droves while he is still in his winter quarters; the occasional imp. would mean that he should wait long enough to witness their return.

Since all of the activities mentioned ("Do we have anything to fear while . . .") are actions of the king, it might be assumed that the taruppantari of the birds was a collecting of birds undertaken at the king's order, and not a congregating of the birds which was beyond the king's control. But in spite of this possibility we prefer the interpretation that the middle tarupp- means "congregate" and refers to the action of the birds themselves. Friedrich, HW (1952) 139, thought that the meya(n)na' in this construction was the same word as meyani-, which he judged to be of uncertain meaning. Giterbock, RHA XXV/81 (1967) 144, also assuming that these were birds of the meyani-, translated "every (kind of) birds". Archi, SMEA 16 (1975) 141, connected the birds of m. with the word miyatar and translated "uccelli della prosperith". Cf. also Unal, RHA XXXI 45, "V6gel des Gedeihens". Archi suggested that it refers to a rite performed to secure prosperity for the coming year, a rite which employed augury. This theory is ad hoc, for there is no other evidence for such a rite. Neither the word miyatar "growth, prosperity" nor the expression "birds of m." occurs in augury texts. Furthermore, the e in meyannas and the single writing of n in miyanas would be unusual in writing the gen. of miyatar.
c. extent or limit in a numerical sense (of captives and booty): "I, the king, brought home x-thousand, 530 captives, but concerning the captives and livestock which the Hittite infantry

troops specified. For the double nominative construction proposed by Hoffner and followed here compare: min DUMU.LUGAL-ma DUMU.NITA NU.GAL "but if there is no prince, no male child" KBo 3.1 ii 38 (Tel.Pr., OH/NS); URU.rBADi EGIR-paappannasASRUNU.GAL kuigki e~ta "a fortified city, any place of refuge did not exist" KBo 5.8 ii 24-25, ed. AM 152-55. Note that in this construction, although there are two nouns as subject, the verb "to be" when expressed is sg. (~sta).
d. in broken context of oracle questions as the first word in the paragraph: mi-ia-ni- kdn [. . .] KUB 52.7 iii 13; mi-ia-n[i . . ] ibid. 2.
Four combinations of "year" and m. are attested: MU-ti meyan(i)as, MU-ti meyani, MU-as meyanas, and MU.KAM-as meanni. On merely formal grounds one could find the common denominator in partitive apposition. MU-ti meyan(i)as would be explained as loc. sg. followed by loc. pl. The literal meaning would be "in the year, (specifically) in (its) m.'s (periods?)". But in nusmas SA U[D-M]I SA ITU.KAM MU-ti me-e-ia-ni-ia-as SISKUR. SISKUR.HI.A r UL kuiski pi KUB 17.21 iii 14- 15 (cf. ibid. i 21-23) (see a 2' a' 2" above) meyaniyas must be gen. like "day" and "month", thus excluding the interpretation as apposition. And if the loc. + gen. construction is certain here, it becomes most likely in the other occurrences of MU-ti meyan(i)a'. However, it is not possible in the unique combination MU.KAM-ag me-

("There was no limit (or) extent", both nom.) contra ed. AM 170f. ("eine Grenze der Fiille [gab] es davon nicht"); the word order disallows Goetze's interpretation of miyanas as a gen. dependent upon irhas. Hoffner's solution (loc. cit.) adopted here is that both nouns are nom. Alternatively, irhas could be gen. followed by nom. miyanas, or both could be free-standing gen. ("that of the i. and the m. did not exist"); the counterpart of this statement usually encoun- tered in AM is nussan/nukan kappi~wauwar NU.GAL rsta KBo 3.4 ii 43-44 (AM 56f.), iii 35 (AM 76f.), iii 54 (AM 80f.), or nasfan UL anda esta KBo 3.4 iv 43 (AM 136f.); in no case is the number of captives allotted to the
233
to emend this to me-an-ni<-as>. The appo- sitional interpretation of MU-ti meyani and MU-as meyanas is possible. MU-as meyanas might be an ordinary gen. construction "of the extent of the year".
The constructions with MU-ti are attested from OH on, while the construction with MU- as is attested no earlier than NH. In KBo 14.142 i 41 (time of Muw.) the restoration [MU-ti] me- e-ni-ma-as-si is certain, because this line begins a new paragraph, the space in the lacuna is just the right size for MU-ti, and no other word but witti is appropriatebefore meni. The position of
,masi after meni proves that witti mini is a single accentual unit here. If this unit existed also in OH and MH, it might explain why the
 meya(n)ni- d
miyanissi
same, regardless of the inflection of meyani-, meni-. The construction MU-as meyanas first appears in NH, probably after the dissolution of the single accentual unit into independently declinable nouns. That dissolution is shown by MU.KAM.HI.A-patkan me-e-na-as SISKUR in KUB 27.1 i 22 (fest., Hatt. III)and MU-as, mas me-ia-na-as in KUB 38.12 iii 25 (cult inv., Tudh. IV?). Whatever the original significance of the form witti (locative?) in the compound, it is unneces- sary to require translations of the compound witti meyani- to express the idea of the locative witti, as though the case of witti were dictated by that word's function in the surrounding clause. witti meyani- should be translated as a unit (as in the case of nekuz mehur, nekuz mehuni, etc. "(at) evening-time"). It would be easiest to indicate the status of w. m. as a single accentual unit by translating it with an English phrase such as "year-cycle", "year-period", "time-in-the-year", or "year-time", but these words do not exist in English, and their use in this article might mislead. Therefore we have translated w. m. variously, as each context seems to require, occasionally adding a literal tr., but ask the reader to keep in mind that witti m. (as opposed to wittas m.) was a single accentualunitandwasprobablyconceivedofas a compound word (like nekuz mehur).
For the w. m. constructions some contexts suggest the translation "annually" (i.e., at the same time each year), others "in the course of the year", and a few others (perhaps) "at (certain) times in the year".
Goetze was right in thinking the two words to be the same, enough difficulties remain to keep them apart.

MU-ti portion of the expression remains the face". Therefore, although it is possible that
Goetze in JCS 4 (1950) 225 proposed that the
me(ya)ni- in MU-ti me(ya)ni- is the same word
as meni- "face", for which he also posited a
meaning "side". Josephson (Part. 108f.) also
regarded the two words as the same, but
translated "face, surface, length, extension (of
the territory)". Indeed there might be a semantic
link between the two words, but more evidence
is needed in order to prove their identity.
"Face" does not show the longer form meyani-
(or meani-), unless the word meyanigsi/miya,, writing of the first syllable of the word "face" nisgi, which we have assigned to a separate (i.e., meyana/i- or miyana/i- for otherwise lemma, is to be translated "on his/its face/sur- consistent mena/i-) and would increase the

Jakob-Rost understood miyanas and miyanit as forms of miyatar and translated miyanas EME as "Zunge des Wachstums" (p. 82), but miyanit EME as "miyanit-Zunge" (p. 35). The lectio difficilior is miyanit. The fact that the scribe of KUB 24.11 first wrote mi-ia-ni-it and then "corrected" it to mi-ia-na-as may indicate the priority of the difficult miyanit. If he had written EME before deciding to correct miyanit, there would not have been sufficient space to substitute -an-na-ag, so he wrote only -na-as. The correction miyanas, therefore, may have been intended as gen. of miyatar, gen. miyannas. The scribe of KUB 24.11 may have been a neophyte, since he made many erasures (in at least 13 lines!), and he pre-ruled his tablet before inscribing it.

Considering the cry miesnas SISKUR else- where in the ritual (see *miessar), miyawa may be the verbal subst. of mai-, miya- (cf. Neu, GsKronasser 130 n. 33, FsNeumann 219 § 5.1), or it could be miyauwa, mid. pres. sg. 3 of mai-

denotes the growth of humans, animals and vegetation. Because such growth implies increase in number as well as size, one may also occasionally translate "proliferation" or "abun- dance". But one should not conclude (as Gbtze did in AM 170f.) from this extended usage that m. is a primary term for large quantities. Nor is it a general term for "prosperity" (as according to Archi, SMEA 16:141).

In the sequence "my fatherhood", "my m.", "my humanity" a quality or status is expected, the quality or status of being miyauwant-. Since one of the meanings of Akk. amTlutu is "old age" (CAD A/2 62b sub 3c), it is possible that m. is a writing of *miyahuwantatarmet "my old age", i.e., either a scribal error (-hu- omitted) or an

That one deity proceeds on the left and the other on the right could, but need not imply that one was evil and the other good. The one on the left is specifically called a mienus, the one on the right is unspecified. Comparison with KBo 17.105 iii 30-32 (see minumar 2b) where the (friendly) Heptad is asked to give minumar to a god while the terrifying (hadugaes) Heptad is to "step off the road" indicates that in KUB 17.12 too there is
a contrast between the LJ.MES KALAG.GA (= hatugaes?) who should step off the road and the mienus who receives the offering. "The mild/gentle/friendly one" would fit. Cf. also minu- v. 1 c for contrast with batuga. For hatuga as reading of KALAG.GA see Goetze, JAOS 74 (1954) 189. Also cf. the contrast hatuga-/miu- KBo 17.105 iii 6-7. Not duplicating this section, but parallel to the context, is KBo 29.191 w. dupl. KBo 29.192, which show that the "cooked" and the "raw" actually do refer to the breads and not to unspecified meats.

Both Gtiterbock and Siegelova assume that the subject of the third clause, if it was expressed by a noun, is in the lacuna, and that the goat kid is part of the simile. This interpretation is represented by our alternate translation in parentheses above. But since we do not know the identity of the speakers, and the subjects of the preceding two clauses are at the head of the clause, we could suppose that something has caused panic among the speakers' live- stock. In this passage Gtiterbock (Kum. 75) thought that the text compared the effect of the fright to diarrhoea (Akk. nihu) among sheep or goats. Siegelova (p. 74) equated the adjectives mienu- and miu- and translated "des glatten Zickleins" (despite the reverse word order). Neumann (IF 78:241), followed by Weitenberg (U-Stimme 42, 402 n. 28), thought m. was a noun designating a body part. Without the end of the clause no definite translation can be established.

When used as an attributive, mekki- some- times preceeds and sometimes follows its noun. Neither sequence predominates.

As Gtiterbock has noted (FsOtten 83), it is possible that the Sumerogram DUn may represent either mema- or te-/tar-. But, as the following evidence shows, no Hittite
complement to DU11 requires an underlying form ofte-/tar-, two complements require mema-, and most are ambiguous. And since few forms of DUn1 are attested, all of which stem from late NH, when te-/tar- was becoming rarer, while mema- remained common, we have listed the exx. of DUn here rather than in the logogram section under DUnI. Act. pres. sg. 1 DU11-ah-hi KUB 40.1 rev. 14 requires a reading
memahhi, as act. pres. sg. 3 DUIn-i KUB 44.50 i 13, 14 requires memai. Act. pres. 3 (pl. by context) DU1n-zi KBo 4.11:16, 24, KBo 15.18:5 permits either mem(i)anzi or taranzi.

 mema-
Akk. verb QABU occur often as logograms in Hittite texts, but since they never carry complementation and can therefore in each instance stand for either mema- or te-/tar-, their occurrences appear in the QABU article. Except for the formula QIBIMA and the single occurrence of IQBI (with tet in the dupl.) in the "anecdotes", all forms of QABU are from Supp. I and later. They therefore probably represent mema- (cf. AM 277 and 289 s.v. AQBI and IQBI), since te-/tar- is quite rare in new compositions from Mursili II and later. All occurrences of DABABU are OH/NS and could represent either te-/tar- or mema-. Of the 27 known exx. of the spelling me-e-mi/a-, 15 are OS, 10 MS, and only 2 NS. Yet THeth. 9:172 discounts this as an orthographic dating criterion. The spelling me-em-ma- (see act. pres. sg. 2 and 3, pret. act. pl. 3, verbal subst. and mng. 12 b) resembles mimma- "to refuse".

A sentence containing mema- does not ordi- narily take a sentence particle unless an adverb is also present, leading to the conclusion that the use of the particle is conditioned by the adverbs and not by mema-. See section 13 above. te-/tar-, which occurs much less frequently than mema-, is largely synonymous with it. This is clear from passages in which one of the verbs is resumed by the other, e.g., nat INA E.GAL-LIM me-mi-is'- ten nu x [ o INA] E.GAL-LIM mahhan da-ra- an-zi KBo 15.28 rev. 10-12; see also KUB 30.10 obv. 25-28. Also instructive is the substitution of one verb for the other in duplicate texts, e.g., [me- m]a-i KBo 11.52 ii 17, dupl. te-ez-zi KUB 20.76 iv 2. Note also the juxtapositon: [ .. ]x tar-as-ki- iz[-zi ... ]/[ ... ] me-mi-is-ki (-)[ . .. ] KUB 55.2 obv. 3-4 (not in dupl. KUB 20.54 + KBo 13.122). Al- though both verbs are found in OH, te-/tar- became quite rare in original NH compositions. te-/tar- was used only rarely to describe speech in a foreign language; while mema- was commonly used in this function. Of the well- attested meanings of mema-, only 2 c, "to testify", and 2 d, "to describe", seem to be lacking for te-/tar-. On the other hand, te-/tar- may bear the meanings "to command" (e.g., KBo 17.4 ii 12-13) and "to designate" (e.g., KUB 9.10 iii 3ff.), and its participle tarant- may mean "betrothed" (KBo 6.3 ii 5, Law § 28a), while none of these nuances are found for mema-.

But, if so, how are we to relate it to pattar,which has also been claimed for "sieve" (e.g., Popko, JCS 26:181f.)? And since our passages say that they sifted(?) by means of a basket (GISerhui- /GISMA.SA.AB), does that exclude hasgunga- from being "sieve"? Since any container with holes could serve as a sieve,

fodder of horses. From the enumeration '/2 BAN ARSANNU 1 hazilai me-ma-al (KUB 12.4 i 8) it is clear that memal is not the Hittite reading of
 memmami-
ARSANNU. It is difficult to explain how the two differed. But since the latter term is occasionally preceded by the TU 7 determinative indicating a cooked dish (e.g., KUB 29.6:10), and is never scattered upon other foodstuffs, perhaps ARSANNU indicates meal which has been boiled, while memal denotes meal in an uncooked state.

Evidence for neuter concord with memiya(n)- consists solely of the four syntactically acc. (sg.) instances cited above. In view of the absence of any nominatives showing neuter agreement, of the presence of the common gender [ap]eniguwantannamemian (KUB 6.41 iii 58) in the same paragraph of the Kupanta-dLAMMA treaty as the neuter apinis'uwanmemian (ibid. iii 65), and of the occurrence of [apenig]uwandanmemiyan (KUB 21.4 i 17) as a duplicate
of apenisuwanmemiyan (KUB 21.5 iii 13) in the Alaksandu treaty, it is best to regard these examples of neuter agreement as exceptions caused by confusion with the largely synony- mous uttar. Another apparent example of neuter agreement is me-mi-an sa-ku-wa-sar in KUB 14.3 i 66 in mng. 1 b 6', but the fact that s. follows m. may point to its being an adverb.
The Sumerogram INIM and the Akkadian A WATU(M) in sg. may be read either memiya(n) or uttar, certain distinction being possible only in writings of non-oblique cases with complementation in -as/-an or -(t)ar, and in the sg. d.-1. complemented with -anni(which fits memiyanni,but not uddani). An indication may also be given by a syllabically written or complemented form in the immediate context, e.g., INIM-an and INIM-za in KBo 24.134 rev. 15- 16 where both probably indicate memiya(n)-. INIM and A WATUM(cf. b 2') with common gender agreement always represent memias. The plurals A WATEME9 and INIM.MES almost always show neuter agreement and therefore stand for uttar. For an exception cf. KBo 5.4 obv. 28 (sub mng. la), where (if A WATEMES is the subject) the pl. verb piddanzi indicates a com. gender pl. subject (i.e., not neut. pl. udddr). Colophons of ritual tablets which designate the tablet as A WAT PN (cf. KBo 5.2 iv 63) could reflect uttlir or memiya-; for the former see DUB.1.KAM QATI SA mKella LOGU[DU u]ddanas KBo 3.7 iv 30 (OH/NS), (with Otten's collation, cf. Beckman, JANES 14:18). The instances of A WAT Tabarnatreated under 1b 2' and 16' suggest uttarin OH, but memiya- in NH.

During the NH period memiya(n)- became more common than uttar and gradually assumed some of the latter's usages. memiya(n)- and uttar are largely synonymous, both possess- ing the three basic meanings "word", "deed", and "matter, affair". uttaris employed as a technical term for "(ritual) procedure" (e.g., KUB 7.41 obv. 3) and "legal case" (e.g., KUB 13.7 i 14), meanings which are not found for memiya(n)-.

Most exx. are what we have called postpositional, in that m. appears to govern an object in the dat. (ANA) or loc. (-i, -as) cases. Those exx. in which such an object is lacking and cannot be reasonably supplied we have called adverbial. It might be claimed that the usages quoted in 10 (verbal idioms), which take an object in the acc., and clearly represent idioms, i.e., cases in which m. has modified the basic meaning of the verb, show a preverbial m.

Gilterbock, Oriens 10:357 ("and face"); the com. gender is problematic, but the tr., following "head", is necessary; since it is but one head, it is unlikely that more than one face is intended; therefore our tr. "cheeks". But in the case of the difficult mi-e-nu-us, which is opposite to DINGIR.DIDLI "the gods", neither a transla- tion "cheeks" nor Laroche's (FsOtten 187) "les visages" seems likely. Therefore we prefer to
consider this reference as mienu- adj. c 2'.
Gilterbock, JCS 6(1952) 39, proposed the reading menin for IGI.HI.A-in, because the only known form of the word for "eye" was sakuwa (neut. pl.), and because the pl. suffix HI.A of the logogram could be easily explained, if the underlying Akk. term was panui ("face", gram- matically pl.). In the meantime a com. gender noun sakuis, with the writing IGI.HI.A-i has been recognized in contexts where it must be

sakuwas (pl.) KUB 33.95 iv 5 (A), ed. JCS 5:156 w. n. 42. However, the fact that menajbandais frequently written IGI-anda in NH seems to indicate that the Hittites combined the logogram with the

Otten suggested to Dressler (Plur. 217) the translation "Jager(?)". And although the activi- ties recorded in our texts are all in festivals, they all describe a man who uses a bow and arrows (cf.

The new example in KBo 26.81 contributes nothing to establishing a translation. On the basis of KUB 33.24 i 32-33 Otten proposed "allein" for minu. "Allein" would seem to be inherent in -pat, leaving minu for another nuance. Eichner (Die Sprache 21:165) reads as Akk. minu for Hitt. kuit: "Why (MINU) did you alone (-pat) sin?" But no question, even a rhetorical one, seems in place here. Such a solution is very unlikely. A tr. "mildly" (neuter adj. as adv.) fails to fit the circumstances, since the grandfather threatens to kill the father, if he is found to be at fault.
Otten, Tel. (1942) 68 ("allein"); Neumann, KZ 75 (1958) 90 n. 3 ("allein"); Giterbock in MAW (1961) 145 ("alone"); Eichner, Die Sprache 21 (1975) 165 (reads Akk. MINU "why?").

No such reinterpretation can be proved in KBo 11.72 (see our a) because of its broken condition. But it is quite possible in KUB 48.123 i 10 (see our d). Bo 6893 is still unpublished, so that its wording is unknown to us. That the writings mi-e- need not point away from "make mild, soothe" to miyanu- "make to thrive" is apparent from the adj. mienu-, minu- "mild, gentle".

Interchange of miumar KUB 15.32 i 57 and minumar KUB 15.31 i 55 (slightly younger script) in duplicates shows that at least in NH, with the appearance of the adj. minu- "mild, gentle" (earliest exx. NS), the scribes were not clearly distinguishing miumarfrom minumar.

34, KUB 22.64 ii 3-4, iii 10-11, KUB 52.45 obv. 7). E The
passive construction indicates that the agent 'longevity'
(introduced by ISTU) has taken the 'm. of the gods'. Archi,
OA 13 (1974) 124, however, claims that ISTU x y dan(tes)
does not specify the agent ("ed anche questa volta non viene
specificato chi sia 1' A"), and translates "y is/are taken from
x". But in the active constructions the agent (subject) is
regularly indicated, while the place from which the objects
are taken is never indicated. Why, in the passive construc-
tion, should the agent never be specified, while the place
from which the objects are taken is introduced? Since with
the exception of GIG.GAL and GIG.TUR, SIGs-ant- and
HUL-ant-, all agents are personal (dU dUTU.AN,
DINGIR.MAH, dDAG, panku-, DINGIR-LUM, DINGIR.
MES, L.MESDUB.SAR, EN.MES, KARAS.HI.A, KUR,
LUGAL, etc.), it may be that the passive construction was
occasionally used to designate the agent, when that agent was
impersonal (MU.HI.A GID.DA). Parallel is the consistent
use of the active construction of pai- with personally
conceived locations, but alternation between active (dai-)
and passive (ki-) constructions with impersonally conceived
ones (see above). As a designation of tokens, SA
DINGIR.MES minumar(.A) stands in implied
opposition to SA DINGIR.MES karpin/karpiu'. pl.neut. acc. me-er-ra-an-da VBoT 24 iii 27, 30 (MH/NS).

We have suggested two possible areas of meaning for words in the misriw(a)- family. The first, which has long been utilized in Hittitology is "bright",,"luminous", "splendid", "beautiful". In this conception "beautiful" would seem to be a secondary development from "splendid". The second possible semantic range, which has arguments in its favor as well, is "complete", "full", "perfect", "without defect". So far no convincingly close Akkadian parallel has been found to the omen text KUB 8.13:13, which leaves the question unresolved whether arumma tepaweszi in the Hitt. means "is/grows very faint/dim" or "diminishes greatly in size" (i.e., "wanes"). Since misriweszi is the opposite of tepaweszi in that omen, it could be translated "is/grows very bright" or "waxes greatly".
Arguments in favor of "splendid", "luminous", etc.: (1) The presence of arummawith misriweszi in the moon omen is easier to translate as "exceedingly" (indicating degree) with brightness than with fullness, although a degree of waxing may be in view rather than a degree of fullness. (2) A prominent feature of the moon's appear- ance would be its brightness. (3) In the Bo 2489+ passage there might be a parallelism between miriwanza and lalukkiwantes, which would favor "bright", "brilliant". Other passages, describing women, temples, lands, sacrificial animals, etc. would be less obviously appropriate for the notion of "brightness". Some might be metaphorical; others should be translated simply "beautiful". (4) The Sungoddess's garment in

f. other: nepisas dUTU-ui i[Sta]nzagti kuel KUB 28.6 is more likely "splendid" than
mi-is-ri-w[(a-a)]n-zahapparnuwashiskuel laluk-
"perfect".
298
 misriwant-
Arguments in favor of "complete", "perfect", "full": (1) the moon omen is just as probably describing waxing and waning as conditions of visibility. (2) As the juxtaposition of misriwanza and lalukkiwantes suggested synonymity above, so do that of misriwanza and humandaza assanuwanzain the description of a woman. One who is endowed/provided with everything is complete. (3) The use of m. to describe a sacrificial animal fits known requirements in other ancient Near Eastern cultures. Such an animal must have no physical defect. The notion of "splendor" or "beauty" is cultically irrelevant.

Most of the passages fit the two interpreta- tions equally well. "Complete" is more fitting to the known passages, when it becomes generalized as "perfect" in the sense of "first-rate", "top- notch". "Bright" can fit most contexts, when it is generalized to "fair" or "beautiful". The tuekkes (limbs) of the woman Ziplantawiya are m., which could be either "bright", "radiant", "fair", "lovely", or "perfect". The garment of the
Sungoddess of Arinna is either a "bright" or "beautiful" one, or it is a "faultless", "perfect" one. So also with temples and lands. The adverb misriwandadescribes the envoy(s) who come to Hatti after the foreign princess. Either they come "brightly", "in pomp", "colorfully" or they come "completely", "in full array". It does not seem possible yet, therefore, to decide firmly in favor of one of the two alternatives.

In KBo 17.1 and dupls. (StBoT 8) the m.-time (ii25) is followed by retiring for the night (ii 43) and the following morning (ii44). In KBo 17.74 and dupl. (StBoT 12) a day begins (i 31), the king goes out (i 32-33), many cultic activities take place at the halentiuhouse (i35-ii 25), the king returns to the inner chamber (ii26) and eats and drinks, the dignitaries go to a meal (iv 13), curtains are raised and the king takes his regalia (iv 27-28), they open and enter the inner chamber at the m.-time (iv 35- 36), more offerings and libations are performed (iv 36-40), the king and queen sit down together and drink, then the tablet ends. In the Ammi- hatna ritual (KBo 5.2 = CTH 471) the scheduled acts begin during the night, when the sun has not yet risen (i 42, cf. ii28). The morning of day one of the ritual is noted (ii29). The client eats (at midday?) (iv 27), m.-time follows (iv 27-28). Another meal is mentioned (iv 42) before the end of the day. This
 mi(t)ta- la
would seem to indicate that the m.-time was in the afternoon. Whether it was early or late afternoon, if the expression was that precise, cannot be determined. In the examples under a, m. might be a meal (esp. with salli-, cf. NAPTANU GAL) after which the time of the day was named (cf. English "supper time").

The key to the meaning of mita- is found in ritual passages involving the use of colored wool (cf. Sturtevant, Chrest. l18f.). Ideograms designating colors of wool are BABBAR "white", GE6 "black", SIG7 .SIG 7 "yellow, green", ZA.GIN "blue" and SA 5 "red". Syllabically written color terms are harki- "white", dankui- "dark, black", hahlawant- "yellow, green", andara- and mita-. Therefore the latter two syll. terms ought to correspond to ZA.GIN and SA 5. That SIG SA5 "red wool" is the log. equivalent of SIG mita- is suggested by comparison of [SIG andaras]tepu SIG mi-i-ta-as tepu KUB 7.53 + KUB 12.58 i 45, with SIG ZA.GIN SIG SA 5 ibid. ii 28 (cf. Goetze, Tunn. 70f.), and is confirmed by [ISTU] SIG ZA.GIN SIGSIG7.SIG7SIGmi-it-ti-it KBo21.47ii4(cf. Rost, MIO 1:370f.).

Since syll. wr. mita- never modifies anything
 (SIG)mitai-
that SA5 describing objects other than wool may stand for another Hittite word, perhaps indicat- ing a different subsection of the "red" and "brown" area of the spectrum.
mita/i and SA 5 probably covered a section of the spectrum including red and brown. Since the precise color of objects described by miti- and SA 5 cannot be determined, we have not attempted to choose between "red" and "brown" as transla- tions in specific cases. Instead we have arbitrarily used "red" as the "unmarked", conventional translation of SA 5 and miti-.

Our tentative interpretation is based on the following facts. 91/d shows that the verbs mita(i)- and SfGmiteski- belong together. The sign SIG precedes m. without word space (coll.) and is therefore a determinative; as Neu (StBoT 5:142 sub NA4piruluwa- note 4) already assumed, and

Through the alternation of NINDA mitgaimi-
and NINDA "AL" (= KU 7) in the duplicate
passages cited above under section a, Goetze (JCS
5:67-73) established their equivalence and noted
the contrast between NINDA mitgaimi-/KU7
and NINDA EMSA in the preceding paragraph.
In this way he was able to show that the sign
which resembled AL was actually KU7 (Labat
#110). Since one of the Akk. translations of Sum.
KU7 was matqu, Goetze even entertained the
idea that "Hitt." mitgaimi- might ultimately
derive from the Semitic root mtq "sweet". He
also (JCS 5:72f.) analyzed mitgaimi- as a Luwian
passive participle. If this is so, then the word (:)miu- A adj.; soft, smooth, mild, gentle, should be strictly translated "sweetened (through pleasant, agreeable; from OS.f

Myth 38, tr. ANET 128 and NERT 165 = RTAT 186, and cf. Ehelolf, OLZ 1933:3 note 2; both ANET and RTAT ("gtinstige Befunde") understand mius'alugas as a favorable sign encountered during inspection of (lamb) exta, but miu- and its etymologically related words never occur in Hittite extispicies. And since we know that Hittite extispicies were sometimes (perhaps even exclusively?) performed on adult animals (UDU.SIR-isin KUB 16.29 obv. 8-9, 14, 19, etc.), it is not likely that a formulation dealing with favorable findings would specify the newborn ("lamb") as here. More likely the gentle (miu-) bleating of the lamb (note: the young animal is singled out) symbolizes the fertility of the livestock; cf. also KUB 33.19 iii 11, 13 (Myth. 63), KUB 33.21 iii (10), (11) (Myth. 61), KUB 33.38 iv (10) (Myth. 85).

KUB 29.50 iv 7-10 (MS?), ed. Hipp.heth. 212f., cf. ibid. 190f.
A finite form of the cognate Luwian verb is found in another hippological text in a similar context: [.. . DAN]NA ma-a-u-wa-ni- in-ta "(the horses) m.-ed (pret.!) [... for x m]iles(s)" KUB 29.55 i 22, ed. Hipp.heth 152; the Luw. verb is active, probably to be translated "ran in fours", "ran in (teams of) four".
The translations are based on the similarity to meu-, miu- "four" (Hipp.heth. 153 n. c) and Luw. mauwa "four". Such a derivation is feasible. Although no four-horse chariot is shown in the scenes of the battle of Kadesh, we have no knowledge of whether the Hittites may have used quadrigas for other purposes, such as horse racing. Although no example is preserved of m. in the same clause with a term for the horse's gate (zallaz uwa-, etc.), there is good reason to restore such a word in the lacunas present in these texts. Therefore, one can probably exclude an interpretation of m. itself as a gait ("trot", "canter", etc.).

Since muwas does not mean "rival" (Akk. 'aininum), nor does it seem likely that it was connected with ninu "(a medicinal plant), ammi", it is unclear what the Hittite scribe was thinking of. For other passages in lex. texts claimed to contain muwa- see below in the discussion section.
1. (an awe-inspiring quality possessed by the king, deities, the lion, countries and boundaries)-
a. secured by the king in battle; "If on this campaign, wherever I turn, you will assist me," nahsarattansmu-kan tiyasi harqanumianarha& za A.A-an udahhi SIGs-ru "and step on my fear, so that I will destroy it, (and if) I will bring home for myself m., let (the oracle) be favor- able" KUB 5.1 iii 54-7 (oracle question, NH), ed.

Will he bring home for himself m. and joy?" KUB 49.100 rev.? 10-11 (oracle question, NH); cf. also, the lot "king's muwa-" under mng. 2; see further below 1 c.
b. belonging to countries: [m]dn ME SA KUR URUHatti U SA KUR UR[U... [ma?-]an- qa-ma mu-u-wa-as SA KUR URUHatti ser x[ .. ] "If battle of the land of Hatti and of the land of [... ], but somehow the m. of the land of Hatti [ ... ] above" KUB 49.74:23-24 (oracle question, NH); note the connection of m. with battle; cf. in PN-s below 1c.
c. in personal names (See NH pp. 322-24): Most bearers of names containing the element muwa- are men. However, the element is attested in three feminine names fHepamuwa, 'Muwanani and 'Muwatti. The first element in X-muwa names probably indicated the possessor of the quality: gods Arma, Santa, Tiwata and Uppar(a), goddesses Sauska and Hepat (cf. Sauskamuwa and Hepamuwa), the lion (UR.MAH-muwa), the army (KARAS-muwa), lands and cities (cf. HattuSa-muwa, Kappariya-muwa, Kaska-muwa,
oi.chicago.edu
 muwa- ld
Mizra-muwa), the border (Irha-muwa), and the field(?) (Ulila-muwa). Muwa-X names such as Muwanani (muwa- + "brother"), Muwatti, Muwa-UR.MAH, Muwa-ziti and *Muwasarma (attested only in vowelless Aramaic script) are probably to be similarly understood. For other names with muwa- + a (Luwian?) word of unknown sense see NH p. 322 and add NH 834 and Muta-mu(wa) (Hogarth, Hittite Seals, p. 89 fig. 112, cf. Beckman, JAOS 103:625). Uncombined muwa- is also used as a name (NH no. 832). For the PN Muwat(t)al(l)i see muwa(t)ta(l)la- adj. Later Luwian and Anatolian names written in Greek letters sometimes contain the element -oag (cf. Zgusta, Kleinasiatische Personnamen p. 663); cf. also
Khossian, SMEA 24:225-27.
d. muwa- might occur as a component in the (hieroglyphic) Luwian composite noun INFANS ni-mu-wa/i-za-s(a) "child" < neg. + muwa- "not having muwa-" (cf. Oettinger, Stammbildung 490 n. 84).

Ambiguous "mu"-an occurs in the following passages: [. . TI-tar MU-an in-nir-tar KUB 49.85 obv. 10, ZAG-tar MU-an-na KUB 52.49 ii (4), KBo 14.21 i 45, SA LUGAL ADAMMA MU-an-na KBo 2.6 ii 34, ZAG-tar ADAMMA MU-an KUB 16.30 iii 5, SA 5 IZKIM MU-an-na KUB 52.68 i 11, SILIM-ul MU-an-na KUB 5.3 iv 9, KUR-ea assu MU-an-na KUB 49.22:5, MU-an KUR-easIa asIfu KUB 5.4 i 54-55, pabhanumar MU-an-na KUB 16.77 ii 69, and innarawatarMU-an-na KUB 22.26 obv. 4 tr. "strength and [seminal] fluid" by Puhvel, HED 1-2:369, 372. Thus, the occurrence of unambiguous muwan (mng. 2) and MU.KAM- an in very similar combinations among the tokens in the lot oracles makes it impossible to decide on the basis of context which of the two words is being expressed by the spelling mu-an(-na). But since the normal rules of Hittite syllabifica- tion are against a spelling mu-an (as opposed to mu-wa-an), and since there is no certain ex. of mu-an for *muwan in any text, it is better to read these exx. as MU-an(-na).
The translations "sperme", "flux vital" (Laroche, NH p. 323), "(seminal) fluid" (Puhvel, HED 1-2:372) were based on several considerations. In the vocabu- lary passage (Akk.) bu-bu-uh-du "pustule" = (Hitt.) x-wa-as / (Akk.) [a-d] a-am-mu "blood" =(Hitt.) is-har "blood" / (Akk.) rsarl-ku "pus" = (Hitt.) ma-ni-is KBo 1.51 rev. 16-18, the first sign in the Hittite word of line 16 was read mu!? by Friedrich, KlF 1:376 w. n. 4. Since the resulting word *muwa- immediately precedes two words denoting body fluids, it was assumed alsoto be such a fluid. However, the sign on the tablet is not mu- but pal- (coll.). Therefore this text contributes nothing to the elucidation of muwa-.
A second lexical text has (Sum.) [me] =(Sum. pronunciation) me-i = (Akk.) [d]tu-u-tu "man- liness, virility" = (Hitt.) FA.A.UR-af KBo 26.25 iii 1 (Erimhbu Bogh. A5), ed. MSL 17:115 iv 33, dupl. of KBo 13.1 iv 33 (Erimhus Bogh. A), cf. StBoT 7:26f. However, there is no proof that the logogram A.A.UR is to be read the same way as A.A (i.e., muwa-). Therefore one may not use this lexical entry to prove that muwa- means "manli- ness, virility". Since PNs show that m. was possessed by goddesses as well as gods, a

 muwani[yant-]
translation "semen" is unlikely.
Probably A.A is a rebus writing (Sum. A = Akk. mu "water"), intended to evoke the sound muwa-, but not the meaning.

The body part m. is attested for the following animals: cattle KBo 17.15 rev. 4, KBo 22.172:2-6, KBo 13.167 ii 2, 5, KBo 17.30 ii 2, sheep KBo 23.34 i 26, lambs KUB 45.51 ii 16-17, 20-21, and mice KUB 27.67 iii 52, 57. For a time m. was thought (Laroche, RA 48:47) to be the Hittite reading of Sum. TI "rib" until a list was published in which the two occurred together (Otten, KBo 23 Inhaltstibersicht, V). Unlike the liver and heart, which are cooked over an open flame (happinit, IZI-nit), the m., ribs, 'hand', breast, head and hind leg are almost always cooked in a pot (DUGUTUL, Akk. diqaru). The only ex. known to us of an animal's head and breast being roasted on a flame is KBo 20.64 obv. 11.
Because of the det. and the close similarity of spelling we have included UZUma-ah-ra-en x[ ...] KBo 17.30 ii 2; its context indicates only that it was eaten. We have kept mahurai-(s.v.) and mahhuri- (s.v.) apart, because they are not written w. UZU det., and there is no evidence from their contexts that they designate a body part.

In KUB 32.130 the verb mugai- is used synonymously with "give a mukesar" and "give a SISKUR.SISKUR" (cf. sub mukesar, mng.
1). Laroche, priere hittite 23, thinks that (arha) talliya- is the specific verb for the evocation. In ibid. 22f. he combines mugai- with the magic paths which should bring the gods near. The lex. evidence equating mugawar with Akk. tazimtu "lament, complaint" is not supported by the use of m. in actual contexts.

CHD under (GIS)mari- a ("rattle?"). In ancient Egypt sistrums were used to scare off evil spirits. But we have no way of knowing what kind of noise-producing implements the Hittites pre- ferred for this procedure. The mukar was used both to scare off evil and to summon a (good) god. The GISPA.HI.A of the m. could be the parallel rods which pass through a sistrum, or they might be wooden handles. The pl. GISPA.HI.A need not imply that a single m. had
more than one GISPA, since the gen. GIsmuknaS can also be plural ("rods of the mukars"). But it seems certain that the GISPA.HI.A brought from the Silver Trees were used to construct the mukar(s).

A mukessar can be something written or described on a tablet (1 a 1', 2', 1 b 6'). It is something concrete with the following verbs: pai-"to give", asnu- "to provide for (a ritual with
offerings)" (1b 4'), sara da- "to pick up" and pard peda- "to carry off" (mng. 2). In other passages it is unclear whether the m. is words, ritual actions
GISmukna-
or offerings, as the verbs used with it are ambiguous.
In some cases it seems that m. might be a Hittite reading of SISKUR. This is likely in the exx. sub 1 a 1', 2', 1b 3', 4', 6'. One ex. under 1 a 2' actually has SISKUR.SISKUR as variant to m., and the text listed first under 1 b 1', KUB 32.130, gives the impression that mukessar ... pai (7), SISKUR.SISKUR piskanzi (14, 22), muke, 9kanzi (17) and muganzi (18) all refer to the performance of rituals. On the other hand, mukisnas SISKUR.SISKUR (1 b 1' second ex.) excludes the equation. It occurs in the same tablet of the rites for the Stormgod of Kuliwisna as the phrase mukisnas ishas (1c 4'). This shows that the latter refers to a person for whom a specific kind of ritual, viz., a mukisnas SISKUR, is performed. So the LOmukisnas ishas is only the EN of a specific kind of SISKUR, not of any ritual. It is possible that in the late period such a generalization (i.e., a person for whom any ritual is performed) took place (see the variant above). - On the question of whether SISKUR-ear (RS 25.421:52) is mukessar, maltessar, or some yet unknown noun in -essarsee bibliography below and discussion under maltessar.

The somewhat diverse meanings posited here might be traceable to a single common idea. But it is also possible that we are dealing with homonyms. Since in mng. 1 the pig does not "remove" the meadow or mountain, but merely digs in it, the semantic connection with mng. 2 "remove" is not obvious. Mng. 3 "to neglect (something)" might derive from mng. 2 +-za ("to remove oneself from a task").

It is tempting to associate this word with the verb mudai- "to remove," garbage being that which has been removed from the table or kitchen and perhaps given to dogs and pigs. The neut. sg. part. would be mudan, but the final -a cannot be understood as "and" or "but" in this sentence and must be part of the word, perhaps a pl.neut. in -a of an n-stem.

The most helpful occurrence is in KBo 17.96 i 6-7. In view of wappuwas IM/insa- it is likely that mutmutali- denotes a place from which the clay was taken. Since there is an animal name mutamut[i- ... ] (q.v.), the derivative noun in -ali- might identify a place characteristic of that animal (a watering hole, a burrow, etc.). This word only occurs in the Old Woman rituals and rituals with Hurrian background. It is related to the Luwian word family mutamuti-, mudamadali- (DLL 72); cf. KU[R UR]UMitamtassa, KUB 14.1 rev. 30. The occurrences in Luwian texts show the vocalization midamudali-: mu-u-da-mu-u- da-li-ti and mu-u-da-mu-u-da-li-§a (DLL 72). In Hittite contexts the word is written mu-UD- mu-ta-... Although one could read UD as -tam-, we refrain in view of the rarity of this syllabic value of the sign in Hittite contexts.

The exx. show that n. is an adj. describing a pastry made from ingredients 1 UPNU to 1/2 SUTU in volume. It can be made of flour and made with sourdough, can be sprinkled with dried fruit, figs and raisins (e.g., KBo 24.59 i? 8-11) and can be served hot. It can be decorated with molded(?) astral symbols and is large and flat enough for various objects to be placed upon it.
n. is of Hurr. origin. A connection with URUNahita(AlHeth 174 and 210) is possible.

n. does not differ essentially in meaning from nah(h)-, but it is noticable that n. (at least in mng. 1) seems to date to be always inchoative, whereas nah(h)- can be either "be afraid" or "become afraid". In addition, whereas nah(b)- takes its obj. in the acc. and dat., n. takes its object only in the dat. (cf. ANA dU in mng. 2, [ku]edani in KUB 33.120 ii 56 in mng. 1 b 2').

Riem- schneider, Omentexte 112, 114, 426 ("[das Heer(?) des] K6nigs wird man zum Abfall verleiten"); the interpretation of LUGAL as a genitive is based upon the lack of any Hittite complement; but since sometimes an uncomplemented logo- gram can represent an accusative, it is impossible to exclude the tr. "they shall remove/set aside the king."

If (or: when) her son wants to come back in again, he/she takes her door.)" ta edi (var. idi) na-a-i "he/she removes (it),

She takes them back and makes her son again her son." KBo 6.13 i 13-18 (Law § 171, OH/NS), w. dupl. KBo 6.26 ii 3-8 D The obj. pron. -us, com. gender, which does not agree with iskisfani and huppuli, might refer to the door (GISIG), the i. and the h. and take its gender from GSIG. Melchert (JCS 31:62-64) thinks that she turns her garments around to show her anger, and that the son turns the door and furniture around to symbolically undo the estrangement. But three documents from Ugarit (RS 8.145:16-23, ed. Thureau-Dangin, Syria 18:246, 249, CAD S 257 right, tr. ANET 546 bottom right; RS 20.146:8-10, ed. Nougayrol, Ugar. 5:177, cf. Berger, UF 2:339f.; RS 17.159:26-27, 37-39, ed. PRU 4:126f., tr. CAD L 219 right) attest the custom of a disinherited son leaving his garment behind, in the first two cases upon the door bolt. The garment symbolizes the son's legal claim to the status of sonship. Such a symbolism seems much more appropriate in a law than disarranged clothing showing anger. Furthermore, the d.-l. DUMU.NITA-iJ'fi is unlikely to mean "in the face of her son" (Melchert), whereas the person from whom something is taken is regularly expressed by the dative. Cf. KBo 10.45 ii 27 cited sub nakki-A 1g.

e. mountains: (mid.):HUR.SAG-an tarmaemi t.asta edi natta ne-e-a-ri "I will nail down the mountain, so that it will not be removed (from its accustomed place)" KUB 31.4 obv. 13 +KBo 3.41 obv! 12 (legend, OH/NS), ed. Otten, ZA 55:160f. ("so dass es sich nicht mehr von der Stelle bewegen lisst"), cf. Josephson, Part. 210 ("it shall not be overturned"), 282 n. 84; (act.): (and when the bull came and lifted the moun- tain,) s'anasgta [edi na-a]-es "it removed it (from its place), (and we reached the sea)" ibid. 18-19 + 17-18, restorations from Josephson, Part. 211, Houwink ten Cate, Records 22. According to Melchert, this ex. shows that nai- in conjunction w. edihas its usual attested sense of "turn". But in fact there is no reason to think of the mountain turning at all; it is simply taken out of the way, so that it no longer obstructs the path.
f. (mid.) "to remove oneself," i.e., "todesert": see3b 1'b'2".
g. (summary of edi nai-): Melchert (Jcs 31:62-64) seeks to derive all translations of edi nai- from the idea "to turn around". But this theory does not adequately explain the occurrence of the verb in KUB 31.4 + KBo 3.41 (section e), where the mountain does not "turn around". Even Melchert must concede that in that passage edi nai- must be translated "budge from its place" (p.63). Controverting the king's words is expressed by other verbs: wahnu- and bulla- (cf. memiya(n)- 1 b 2') and arha pessiya-. Each of these verbs has its own flavor. Perhaps wahnu- "turn" most closely approximates English "controvert".The legal symbolism of Law § 171 is more appropriately elucidated by symbolic actions associated with disinheriting sons attested in the same general area and time (Ugarit) than from the behaviour of deities in myths. The mid. edi nai- "to remove oneself, desert" could refer to turning oneself around and proceeding in the opposite direction, but it could just as easily refer to removing oneself from one's customary position of allegiance.

Aranzah River; thirdly I have impregnated you with the mighty(?) Tasmi(su)" KUB 33.120 i 30-33 (Kumarbi myth, NS), cf. Gilterbock, Kum. 7, *2, translit. Myth. 155, tr. ANET 120, MAW 157; cf. Melchert, Diss. 327; since these gods constitute a "burden" (aimpa-), we might have translated nakki- here as "heavy" in the concrete sense. But because of the parallelism with "irresistible" it seems that Anu wants to warn Kumarbi here of the expected power of these potential foes; hence "mighty" seems here more appropriate than "honored" (mng. 1). Cf. discussion below; aruni piran §dkuwa taswa[ banzi] /
nakki- A
(CAD kabtu mng. 2 "dangerous, grievous, severe"). It is asserted that one ought to compare nakki- with kabtu, because nakkiyatar (in the dative form nakkiyanni) is twice written in Hittite with DUGUD-anni (1683/u iv 29, w. dupl. KUB 1.8 iv 14 [Hatt. iv 29] and KUB 21.38 rev. 15 [compare obv. 54]), and DUGUD is the regular Sumerogram for Akk. kabtu. The second theory is Del Monte's (VO 3:117-19), who opts for the notion of power. For him the basic meaning of nakki- is "powerful," from which "important" and "diffi- cult" could have developed. Del Monte believes
oi.uchicago.edu
iOtamanuss;a kukkuraskanz[i] / GUD-askan
iwar kunnan Uzupaltanan/ kuragkanzi n.an that the writings w. DUGUD are isolated and
DUGUD-ya IZI-ni peseskan[zi] "They blind (his) eyes before the sea, and they cut off (his) ears. They cut off (his) right shoulder like an ox and throw it onto a roaring fire" Bo 3640 iii(?) 7-10, ed. Ehelolf, KlF 1:397 and Ertem, Flora 157f. (Ertem read DUGUD-ya as "GE6 -as-ia," which is impossible; but it is easy to mistake a DUGUD sign for MI+AS, and
DUGUD-ya IZI-ni is perfect for nakkiya pahhuni.)
DUGUD with phonetic complement -u-, KUB 5.1 iii 67, iv 77 is not to be read nakki- (con- tra THeth 4:181, q.v.) but rather dasu-; DUGUD- an ibid. i 99 can be either *nakkiyant- or dasuwant-.
late, and he wishes to minimize the contribution of this usage to the understanding of the mean- ing of the family of nakki- (VO 3:119).
We have found very few occurrences of nakki- cases in which either "heavy" or "power- ful" (nakkiyatarmng. 2) are the most probable translations, although both are possible in a number of instances. On the contrary, "a heavy load" is dassu GUN-an (KBo 1.42 iii 26 = MSL 13:138 line 166). There is also DUGUD with phonetic complement -u- = dassu- (see above at the beginning of the discussion section). The two words and some of their derivatives are close to one another; cf. nu-,tta,,kan SUM-an lamnas iftarna nakki (usage 1 a) with SUM-antet dasu = Akk. sumki sTru in the IStar hymn (JCS 21:258 Hi4andBo7b),nakkiASRIULA andnakkipedi (nakki- A 2) with tassa(w)i pedi, [tassa]wi
We maintain that four areas of meaning can
be identified for the family of words which are
comprised by nakki- and its derivatives, al-
though we cannot show an example of each pedi (KBo 3.8 iii 10, 28, the place of the leopard). Also
meaning at present for each word in the family.
Expressed as adjectives those areas of meaning
are: (1) honored, important, valuable, (2) diffi-
cult, (3) powerful, and (possibly) (4) heavy.
One can see how some of these could have
developed from others, but no one has convinc-
ingly demonstrated which meaning is the basic
one from which the others developed. To date
there are two theories as to what that basic
meaning was. The earlier explanation, repre-
sented by Friedrich, HW 148, posits a basic idea
of heaviness or weight. According to this view
nakki- is to be compared with Akkadian kabtu,
whose semantic development was the same: meaning "heavy," and many Hittite words basic meaning "heavy," derivatives "honored,
important" (CAD kabtu mng. 3 and 4), "difficult"
(hastali-, tar uili-, innarawant-) can be trans- lated "strong," it seems unlikely that either

cf. dasesta (KBo 4.10 obv. 40), dasseszi (KUB 45.79 obv. 12, KUB 50.89 ii 5) and exx. under nakkes- 2 and 3 (although some of the exx. spelled DUGUD-ess- might belong to dasess-).
In the great majority of cases the best sense is achieved by translating nakki- with (1) "impor- tant, honored" or (2) "difficult." The most that can be claimed for (3) "powerful" and (4) "heavy" is that (3) "powerful, mighty" is a likely translation in a few cases (nakkiyatar mng. 2 "power," nakki- A 3 "mighty") and both of them are also possible in other passages. And since dasu- is admitted by all as having the

"(physically) heavy" or "powerful" is the basic meaning of nakki- and its derivatives.

The stem is nakkiu-, whether or not the vocab. (Sum.) [bara?] = (Akk.) [o o o] = (Hitt.) na- ak-ki-i-us KUB 3.94 i 28 belongs to this lemma. The n.'s are deities or demons associated with dU.GUR (Nergal), the Sungoddess of the Nether- world, and the Former Gods (cf. 1 a and c). They are therefore netherworld beings. The use of SIG5 to describe them on occasions merely under- scores the fact that chthonic powers were often besought to perform services beneficial to the living. It does not necessarily mean that there were "good" and "bad" classes of n.'s. The writings nakkiu- and nakki(ya)- could be either tolerated phonetic variants or could (in the case of nakki(ya)-) be a genuine variant (substanti- vized adj. nakki- "the powerful ones").

Laroche's (FsGiiterbock 137-40), although his translation
assumes the emendation of na-at to na-at(-ta) in KBo 6.2. The history of the interpretation of this passage is sketched
 nakkussa-
by Laroche. Since the direct object of the verb sarnink- is invariably the original lost or damaged item, not what is put in its place as a reparation, it is impossible for nakkus to be translated "substitutes" here. aresseSa / [. .. ] uwateten,,wa / [. . . -w]atar umini / [. .. -]x-wa- tar-ra na-ak-ku-us (§) "his/her companions [...], 'Bring [...], we will see [...-]watar, [...] and [. . . -]watar (is) damage" KBo 3.60 i 9-12 (cannibal story, OH/NS) O although the context is damaged, it is unlikely that there was an additional line between numbered lines 12 and 13 which contained writing only on the lefthand side of the column, since neither Figulla'scopynorForrer'stransliterationshowemptyspace or a slanting dividing line. Although the sentence could have continued over the paragraph line, this is rare in Hittite. If the sentence ends with nakkus, it is almost certain that it is a nominal sentence, and that nakkus is the predicate. [. .

StBoT 25:221; in a paragraph with Hittite words such as are often found in ritual or festival descriptions (pattar,waksur).
Although the first two cited exx. are very likely nom.-acc. neut. -stems, the ex. from KBo 8.74 i 5 is less conclusive. The tentative tr. is based solely on Laws §98.

The term nakkufsi/a- designates living beings to whom sins are transferred and who are then released (tarna-) in order to carry off the evils (peda-); see van Brock RHA XVII/65:126-139, Km- mel, StBoT 3:146f. and Gurney, Schweich 50-58. Gurney advocates keeping a strict distinction between tarpalli- "substitute"and nakkussi- "scapegoat, carrier (to remove evils)." Animals which served this purpose, but are not called nakkussi-, appear in KUB 9.32 obv. 4-32 (tr. Gurney, Schweich 49). Some have suggested that the word is of Hurr. origin (van Brock, RHA XVII/65:132-139, Gurney, Schweich 51). Others favor a Hittite source
(Melchert, Diss. 285; Lebrun, Samuha 135). Therefore, a connection with Hurro-Akk. nakkussu is de- batable, even if suggestive; cf. Goetze, Kizz. 34f. w.n. 133; CAD N/1:186f., AHw 722b. Since the word nakku- might designate living and inanimate carriers of evil, it is possible that the two words are derived from the same root.

Since one expects a pres.-fut. tense in the apodosis of an omen, we suppose a middle form. A difficulty with our interpretation is that all of the -ess- verbs attested in the middle (aSiwantess-, makkesg-, pargawess-, parkes'-, te, pawess- in Neu, StBoT 5:21, 111, 137, 172) are iteratives. nakkusses'da[ri]would be the only exception.

neider, Omentexte 304, the last sign in obv. 8 can be read

-rkdn -. The last sign in obv. 6 certainly cannot be -kdn-.
2 Riemschneider's reading is questioned by HW 1:124f.,
which reads a meaningless "-es-iS!" both times. The photo, however, definitely excludes the -is- reading of the hand copy. Our interpretation of the verb as a singular makes
2 possible the interpretation of anzase/is (which HW
construes as a stem anzaSSi-) as a noun dnza and its possessive enclitic.

f. immediately after nu, used in a main clause which follows a causal clause: Since Sommer, Pap. 6-7, all of whose examples actually concern nu namma followed by a negation, it has been assumed that nu nam- ma may carry the connotation "therefore, so, consequently" (German "infolgedessen"). But since - just as in cases where a "because" clause is followed by any main clause (often beginning with nu) - the mere juxtaposition of clauses can imply the meaning "therefore, so, consequently" for the main clause, it is possible that namma adds some other (perhaps temporal) meaning ("subsequently," "again"). Examples without negation can be translated as "then": mPIS.TUR-as'mazakan wastul kuit ugkizzi nu!mu'zakan nam-ma d[UTU-SI] mimmas "Because Majhuiluwa realized (his) sin, he then rejected me, My Majesty (and fled away before me)" KUB 6.41 i 40-41 (Kup.), ed.

As the number and case of GSIMAR.GID.DA (.HI.A), which immediately follows it, change, the ending of nana(n)kaltas itself remains the same. This suggests that the word is not an attributive adjective, but rather a noun in the genitive, modifying the wagon.

From context it is clear that nanakussiyant- was the opposite of lalukkiwant- "bright", "lum- inous". How did n. differ in meaning from its synonym dankui-? Watkins (MSS 45:253) thinks n. is "absolute" darkness and has "mythological chthonic or underworld overtones". Although some passages do use n. to describe the nether- world, others (e.g., KBo 12.39) describe a real place, where a tablet might be kept out of sight. It strains credulity to insist that there too we must find overtones of the netherworld. Further- more, the adjective which regularly describes the netherworld is dankui-, not n. The only

In any event, it is worth noting that in the state treaties edited in Friedrich, SV 1 and 2 there is no instance of na-as-ma "or (if)" which is not preceded somewhere in the treaty by man "if": Targ. ii25 (man ii 21), Kup. §10 D 21 (man §10 C 36), Alaki.

reeds") which describes ponds and meadows proves that nata/i-is also the syll. wr. of GI in the meaning "reed." Therefore we have included the examples of simple GI in the meaning "reed." The case for GI/GISKAK.U.TAG.GA "arrow" and GI/GISA.DA.GUR, Akk. SULPU "drinking tube" is less clear. Since they represent different logograms, which may have covered more specialized Hittite terms, despite the ex- istence of the par. GI.HI.A KUB 41.8 iv 6= GIA.DA.GUR.HI.A KBo 10.45 iv 8, we have treated them separately under their logographic writings. Although in Mesopotamian texts the Sum. word a-da-gur4/ 5 is known only in the word dug-a-da-gur 4/5 (= Akk. adagu(r)ru), denoting a container with a pointed bottom, the Hittite term has been shown by Otten (HTR 120f.) to designate a drinking tube. Accordingly, when it has a det., it is not DUG but GI. When it lacks the det. and is qualified by KJ.BABBAR (e.g., KUB 42.10 rev. 8), it denotes a drinking tube made of silver. There is to date in Hitt. no ex. of A.DA. GUR as a container with a pointed bottom.
If GI-pi-in KBo 23.27 i 19 is correctly read as a logogram with phonetic complement, it might show that GI had more than one reading in Hittite. But such evidence is an inadequate basis

Hoffner apud Beal, Diss. 597f. n. 1861.
Although there are no direct parallels for an alternation between nata- and GI in the mean- ing "reed," it would be extremely unlikely that this meaning, which unites the otherwise unre- lated "arrow" and "drinking tube," did not exist for nata/i-. The adj. (:)naduwant- ("having

The three occurrences of GI in the ME§EDI text IBoT 1.36 i 20-21 (Rost, MIO 11:174f.) require comment. The second of these is almost certainly a scribal error and the

writings were rare (HE 1§279a). Since 1960 with
the publication of texts in OS and MS that situation has changed. At any period of the Hittite language scribes could write the word syllabically. But, just as in all periods of Hittite writing scribes completely avoided writing DUMU ("son") syllabically and were reluctant to write hassu- "king" syllabically (as opposed to LUGAL), so during the NH period the Akkadogram U- UL (or UL) was almost always preferred to the syll. writing na-at-ta.

2' the Akkadogram U-UL/UL - a' in OS: In OS texts only two exx. of U-UL have been noted by Neu (StBoT 26:304). Neu is probably right (StBoT 25:52) to stress the close association of the negative with the Akk. USKEN as the reason for the preference of U- UL to na-at-tain KBo 20.33 obv. 3 (OS type II), translit. StBoT 25:53. In the other example U-UL[. . .] KBo 17.9 i 1(OS type I), translit. StBoT 25:31 (line y+1) could also conceal an Akk. verb form. Elsewhere in Neu's corpus of OS ritual and festival texts the negative is always written na-at-ta.
b' MS: U-UL Mt 75/10:10, Mgt 75/45:8, KBo 16.50:5, 14, KBo 16.47:13, KUB 23.77:56, 60, KBo 8.35 ii 4,

c' NS- 1" early NS: In texts copied earlier
than the 13th Century scribes wrote U-UL almost without exception.
2" later NS (probably Muw. II or Hatt. III and later) - a" The writing UL (with one sign) occurs in late NS copies of texts whose originals date from OH, MH and earlier NH (Murs. II). But since these tablets are later copies, they give no proof for the beginning of this writing habit earlier than the 13th Century. In some cases the writing with one sign was necessary because of cramped space.

le is the negative of volition, used to express prohibition, while natta is the negative of assertion. Yet natta can occur in dependent or
independent clauses, in interrogative, declara- tive, or asseverative clauses. Under certain circumstances it can even occur in quasi- imperative clauses in place of the volitional negative le. This is particularly the case in text genres which state in a declarative manner the duties or obligations of certain people - the laws, treaties, instructions, ritual and festival texts.

It is usually sentence final when the verbal form takes the stressed initial posi- tion, e.g. KBo 3.34 i 23 (a 1' a'), KUB 9.15 ii 18 (a 1' c'), KUB 13.4 iii 79 (a 1' c'), KUB 14.4 iii 24 (b 1') (all with finite verb) and KUB 5.3 ii 46-47 and 50 (c 1' b') (with participle), but occasionally an additional adverb follows nawi KUB 21.29 i 14 (b 1'). There may intervene between nawi and the verb the various indefinite and relative pronouns - e.g., kuit KUB 22.70 rev. 51, 54 (c 1' b'), and kuigki Mt 75/15:16-17 (a 1'b'), conjunctions - e.g., kuitman KBo 3.4 i 20-21 (b 2'), and adverbs - e.g., anku KUB 29.55 i 3 (a 1' b'), and kuwapikki

:nawil(a?)- Luw. n.; pasture(?), or pasturing animals(?); NH.t
URUAyaras LO.MESUMMEDA :na-u-i-la-as"the Ayaran keepers of the pastures(?) (or: of the pasturing animals?)" Bronze Tablet i 79 (treaty of
Tudh. IV w. Kurunta), ed. StBoT Beiheft 1:14f., 40f. Oc- curs as an occupational designation in a list of cities which also contains other occupational designations: augurs, tent men, scribes of the tuppas, spear men, potters, cupbearers, etc. The marker wedges probably indicate that the word is Luwian. This noun is presumably a genitive modifying LO.MESUMMEDA. Otten based his tentative translation "Weide(vieh)-Hiiter(?)" on the Hurrian verb in the clause nali agabenasa ndwaa "a deer grazes (ndwaa = Hitt. wesiyattari) in the pastures (agabenasa = Hitt. weses)" from the new Hurrian-Hittite bilingual to be published by Neu, and from the determined form naunni (i.e., naunne) listed in Laroche, GLH 180, which Otten notes is "sicherlich ... eine Landschaftsbezeichnung." If this surmise is correct, the Hurrian word naw(i?) "pasture(?)" might derive from the same word as Akkadian naWU <*nawiu (cf. CAD N/1:249 "pasture land on the fringes of cultivated areas," AHw 771) and Hebr. naweh. The derived form nawil(a?)- would mean "those (i.e., animals) of the pasture land." In Hittite texts L.MESUMMEDA keep horses (KBo 5.7 obv. 23, 27, KUB 29.40 ii 13, KBo 27.10:3), but also apparently cattle and sheep (KUB 16.39 ii 33-34, HTR l0f.). It is not clear, however, in what way the LUMMEDA differed from the LSIPA.GUD or LSIPA.UDU, or how Hur- rian naw(i?) differed in meaning from agabe.

 negna- b
pound noun of which "brother" formed a part. Since in the compounds annaneges and paps panegne' the meaning is not "sisters/brothers of the mother/father," but "having the same mother/father," one might argue that in order to avoid ambiguity the Hittites did not use the compounds to express "son of brother," "brother
of father," etc.
3' Half brothers could also be designated with SES without any additional qualifica- tion: KUB 26.5 iii 59 (instr. for LU.SAG, Tudh. IV), ed. Dienstanw. 14. But the existence of pappanegnes "brothers having the same father" and annaneges "sisters having the same mother" proves that compounds could be used to express the distinction between full and half brother/sister.
b. an equal ranking king in a treaty rela- tionship (cf. also nega- mng. c, *negatar, and *neg, natar): Partners refer to each other as ES- YA "my brother"; an equal ranking queen in a treaty relationship is referred to as NIN-YA "my sister" (cf. nega- c).

The form is the vocative (or "cas absolu" in Laroche's terminology) of an a-stem noun. In this instance the vocative is imbedded in the clause.

emendation of the OS copy to ne-eg-na(-an). But could we not have here a diachronic difference? Could not the OS original have had andamaz AMA-KA anna balzissa U AHI,,KA negna halzissa, which the NH scribe "corrected" to ... annan ... negnan . .. ? The very fact that we find the OS construction with an embedded vocative awkward could have been the reason the NS scribe changed it to "proper" NH.
From the pairing of annaneges "sisters having the same mother" and pappa-S[ES.MES] the meaning of the latter ("brothers having the same father") can be determined. pappanegnes is the only known candidate for the syllabic writing of pappa-S[ES.MES], and its usages are consonant with a translation "brothers having the same father" (for discussion of the evidence cf. sub pappanegna-). This sets up an equation: SES.MES *negnes "brothers" (nom. pl.). It has been long known from phonetic complements to SES that the final syllable of the stem of the underlying Hitt. word was -na- (voc. SES-ni, nom. sg. SES-a!). negna- "brother" stands to pappanegnes "brothers having the same father" in a similar relation as nega- "sister" to annaneges "sisters having the same mother". negna- "brother" has been built from the word nega- "sister" by the addition of -na-. This may indicate that at an earlier stage nega- meant "sibling" and that negna- was the form specialized ("marked") for masculinity. In Luwian the opposite pattern is seen, where nanasri-"sister" seems to have been built upon nani- "brother" through the addition of the feminine suffix -(a)sri-.

III or Tudh. IV), ed. Sommer, AU 198f.
The meaning of negna- implied in this factitive verb is either negna- b or c. Other parts of the letter, especially the augmented reverse, on which see Hoffner, AfO Beih. 19 (1982) 130-37, suggest that, while the Hittite king is the
addressee's superior and therefore calls him DUMU-YA "my son," the two of them also control a subordinate vassal (Walmu was "our kulawanis vassal"). Therefore, while the rela- tionship is not the same as that with other Great Kings (of Egypt, Assyria), whom the Hittite king calls SES-YA "my brother," it is a higher status than ordinary vassalship.

The preceding exx. define nekuz mehur as the time between the late afternoon and bed time, in contrast to ispant- "night" (hipp.). Cultically n. m. is the time of day for the performance of purification rituals (s'eelligki-), as well as for the manipulation of the a-a-bi ritual pits (cf. Hoffner, JBL 86: 393).

It is unclear what case form is reflected in
nekuz. Friedrich (HW 150) advocated the nomina-
tive of a stem *nekut-. Others (e.g., Goetze, 2
Language 27:473f. and Kiihne, FsOtten 204 w. n. 8 and 208f. n. 20) have suggested a genitive in -s from the same hypothetical stem. Other nominal combinations with mehur (q.v.) do not seem to require the genitive case in the first noun. The alternation mehur and mebuni in the clause mahban n. m. kisari (1 b 1' b', 1 c) might suggest that nekuz mehur, like nekuz(a) mebuni, was locative in force (or "adverbial") rather than a real grammatical subject (nominative). But the existence of mabhan bamihanzakisat (KBo 4.4 iii 57, etc.) and GIM-an zenas DU-ri (KUB 7.24 obv. 6, KUB 38.32 obv. 8), where bamihanza and zenas must be real subjects, alongside of GIM- anmabamishiDU-ri (KUB25.23i8,KUB 13.32 obv.7) andGIM-an,,mazeniDf-ri(KUB38.27 obv. 13, KBo 2.13 obv. 25, KBo 26.196 obv. 9) makes the interpretation of mehur as a nominative very probable. The zenaslzeni kisari is nicely paral- leled by nekuza mehur/mehunitiyazi (cf. 1b 1' a', 1c).

It seems that the DN with -annitermination is not confined to images of the deity, but can serve as a real DN: lukkattima LOMEHAL dni-na-at-ta-an-ni-u sipandanzi LUGAL-us, ma,,za dKarmahilin iyazi "The next day the exorcists offer to 'the Ninattanni's' (i.e., Ninatta and Kulitta), while the king worships Kar- mahili" KBo 10.20 iii 37-39 (AN.TAH.SUM fest., NS), ed. Giiterbock, JNES 19:83, 87; cf. also possibly KBo 12.118:12 (rit. frag., NS). Even if such a termina- tion were confined to images and representa- tions, it need not denote small size. Therefore Friedrich's (BiOr 5:51f. w. n. 18, HE2 §50c) inter- pretation of -anni- as a diminutive-forming suffix is gratuitous. Cf. the remarks of Giiter- bock in Yaz.2 170f. w. n. 23 about dSarrumanni and against the diminutive interpretation of -anni-.
Wegner (AOAT 36:80 n. 278) pointed out that d/NINDAn. occurs in pl. forms without dkuli&
tanni-; in the one ex. where dn. is sg., it is followed by dkulitanni-. Therefore the pl. forms of dn.and NINDAn. are understood as synecdoche.

Laroche, CTH, pp. 174f., where he reads dNi-in-ga-as,but see Kammenhuber, Arier 152 n. 472.
The proposed definition is based partly on SUR = Akk. zandnu "to rain," partly on the etymological connection with nink- "to drink one's fill" and ninganu- "to drench." The syll. occurrences without the divine determinative in HFAC 84:3, 7, 9 exclude an interpretation of the syll. evidence as an-ni-in-ga-.
Laroche, RHA XIX/68 (1961) 44, has further references, both bibliographical and onomastic. Whereas dSUR occurs in names, ninga- does not.

Although the root verb nink- means both "to quench one's own thirst" and "to get drunk", none of the above passages seems unequivocally to support a translation for the causative
ninganu- "to quench someone else's thirst". Giiterbock, ZA 43:324f.

Laroche thought that nipasuri- corresponded to Akk. amiutum, which denotes the liver as examined in haruspicy ("oracle liver"). But no Akkadian extispicy reports that there is "no amitum" or that there are several (cf. above sub b). It is therefore likely that n. denotes some mark on the oracle liver, whose presence, absence or position had oracular significance.

Interpretation is difficult because of the broken context. Possibilities: (1.) sg. abl. from an unattested *nepisatar;(2.) emendation to ne- pi-sa-an-ta-az, as done by Haas-Thiel, sg. abl. of an unattested *nepisant-; (3.) analyzed as nepilanna'z, see Beckman, StBoT 29:181 w. n. 465, sg. acc. or pi. gen. of nepisa- n. com. Since EGIR-pa DU8-it probably ends a
TU7nirikkia
clause, leaving n. to introduce the next clause, the 3rd pos- sibility (i.e., noun + end.) is the most probable one.

The adv. here is derived from the gentilic in -umna- of the GN, "NeSian", cf. LI.MES ne-Ju-me-ni-es, see also Berman, Diss., q.v.

Forms in combination with sentence enclitic particles: nu can be followed by a number of enclitic particles. These particles are arrayed in a fixed order. The first slot after fnu is occupied by the quotative particle -wa(r-), the second by -nas and -smag, the third by -as, -an, -at, -e and -us, the fourth by -mu, -ta, and -ge/i, the fifth by -z(a), and the
461
nuA a1'
sixth by -kan, -san, -(a)gta and -(a)pa. For summaries cf.
oi.uchicago.edu
Friedrich, HE §288, Hoffner, JAOS 93:520f., FsGiiterbock 93-94 (on -nagand -gmas).

When nu is directly followed by a particle beginning with a vowel other than u, its own vowel is elided, thus: na-a', na-an, na-at, ne (for nu + -e), na-as-ta, and na-pa. Cf. Friedrich, HE §306a.
Some particles beginning with a consonant double that consonant when immediately following nu: nu-usg-e/i, nu- ut-ta, nu-ud-du-za, nu-usg-a-an, nu-um-ma-as-ta (= nu, mmuagta) KUB 31.130 rev. 7 (MS), nu-uk-ku KBo 12.128:6 (NS). Other such particles occasionally double the initial consonant nu-uk-kdn (StBoT 8:80, StBoT 26:127), nu-um-mu KBo 3.40 obv. 14 (OH/NS), and nu-uz-za KBo 6.2 ii 32 (OS) and StBoT 26:128, cf. also Kammenhuber, HdOr 177; other times the consonant is not doubled: nu-za StBoT 26:128 (OS) + passim, nu-mu passim, nu-kdn passim.
The proclitic nature of nu when no enclitics are attached to it is indicated by two phenomena: (1) nu without enclitics never occurs at the end of a line, and (2) in some OS texts no word dividing space occurs between nu and a following word (cf. KBo 3.22:55, 59, 71, 74; KBo 17.1 iii 5, iv 24; KBo

j. statistics: These statistics do not take into account the exx. of asyndesis. There are five particles which one may call conjunctive in nature: nu, su (only OH), ta (properly only OH), ,ma and ,,(y)a. In OH their proportional frequencies are: nu 42%, su 1%, ta 9%, Ima 18%, and ,(y)a 30%. In NH the proportions are: nu 51%, su 0%, ta less than 1%, ,ma 30%, and ,(y)a 18%. The above figures are based on a representative computerized text sample amounting to about 40% of the published NH texts and 90% of the published OH ones. The figures should, therefore, be taken as only approximate. Even these approximate ones allow us to see the relative frequency of the conjunctive particles between the two periods. Since nu increases in frequency from OH to NH by approximately the amount that su and ta decrease, it is likely that in NH nu assumed functions earlier exercised by the older two particles. The fact that ,,ma increases at -(y)a's expense in NH may reflect the replacement of the OH adversative -a (Otten&Soucek, StBoT 8:68f., Houwink ten Cate, Acta Orientalia Neerlandica [1971] 37-42) by NH -ma. Obviously, many of the -(y)a's may have been joining words within a clause rather than joining clauses. But since the same would be true in OH and NH, the relative frequency between OH and NH would not be affected. In both OH and NH nu was the most common of the clause conjunctive particles.

The context can be translated: "Because this matter is so remote, I do not know from which Hittite king Wilusa defected.

The tr. "cannot" is possible in the Erimhus entries, the Illuyanka myth, the KBo 14.20 (AM) passage; it is very unlikely in the
Egyptian queen's speech and in the Kessi story. In these latter two instances it is pride alone
negative of volition (Hoffner, in GsKronasser 38-45), whereby also some etymological connection
with the optative particle man seems likely.
