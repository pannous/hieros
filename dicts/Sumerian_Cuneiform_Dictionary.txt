The niftiest 'Sumerian Cuneiform English Dictionary' in the university world: 

eBook Description 
The unique "MUGSAR 4-Way"  

1. unicode 2. sign 3. lemma 4. translation 

All on one screen. At elite university sites it's all over the place. None give unicodes and their 
translations are superficial / computer generated. 
The real nifty part, the "MUGSAR QuickFinder Index" 

Specially designed for small 'tablet' screens that may not be able to display cuneiform fonts. 

.. 

The first great civilization (fl c. 6600CT - 8000CT) were the Sumerians - "ki.en.gi", who were black 
('saĝ gig.ga') to boot! For the enlightened Sumer is aptly termed the 'cradle of civilization'. 

Much has been plagiarized from them without due attribution, not just the wheel, writing, law, but 
even true etymologies - the real origins of so many English words like 'abzu' = abyss, not to 
mention 'shekel', the Hebrew term for money -- some would have us believe that everything starts 
with the Greeks and Romans, world champion plagiarizers themselves. Our libraries may as well 
forget the non-fiction / history section - just put it all under fiction. How some can relegate this 
great civilization to what's conjured by terms like "ancient" and "BC". It's not going backwards, 
they come first at about 6600CT. 

.. 

Tablet 1 

Inspiration for all this came out of not being able to find a Sumerian cuneiform sign list with 
unicode, lemma and translation. There are some amazing dedicated websites and books produced 
by some amazing academes {missing fragment} ...from the experience of living in Japan and studying 
kan-ji, it became obvious that you have to have the logogram, reading and translation all together. 
Just reading and translation is useless. And now of course linking everything is the unicode – see 
our unique 'MUGSAR 4-Way', an example:

Some well funded universities like Oxford's Faculty of Oriental Studies, ETCSL et al have 
everything separated, don't give unicodes at all, and for the sign they link off to PSD (University of 
Pennsylvania) where it is often not clear which is the relevant one. And their translations are 
superficial, probably computer generated. When you work with the actual cuneiform signs, rather 
than just impotent readings using our boring English phonetic script, you start to see that the scribes 
were not just telling a story, but literally painting the scene. 

When we start going deeper than such misleading translations it becomes very revealing. It's not 
just that to the chagrin of some, that the Sumerians keep referring to themselves as black, there's a 
sign in particular that clearly tells us that the very first professors, scholars, experts, master 
craftsman, the ones who could write and teach, were black... 

...and 'um-mi-a' is not just of a more recent period of only 4000 years ago (Ur III) it goes way back to 
over 5000 years ago (ED IIIb) [a good 2000 years before the Greeks et al]: 

.. 

.. 

Gilgamesh, the hero of oldest written epic is also black 
(Sumerian: Bilgamesh [cf. Billjim!]; Akkad.: Gilgamesh) [𒉋 BIL2 burnt + 𒂵 GA young (bull) + 𒈩 
BIL.GA.MEŠ 

mes (meš) black hero (next on the sign list is the more common black sign 𒈪 
to write = power connotation)] 
MI; and 𒁾 dub 
able 

And not only were the first scholars black, the earliest known author and poet was female (and most 
likely black), Enheduanna. 

.. 

It's even more bewildering when you see someone like Jeremy Black ('1951-'2004) founder of ETCSL, 
publish Literature of Ancient Sumer but leaves out the actual cuneiform. Starting with the 
Introduction (see Google Books) he adeptly covers the nuances using the awesome 9x6cm tablet 
containing 16 lines of Nertal's Axe story, encouraging the reader to begin to feel how enchanting 
Sumerian cuneiform is. Yet he sticks solely to what he calls "our Latin alphabet" (didn't it come west 
via the Phoenicians [Lebanon], as in the phonetic alphabet!) in giving Sumerian readings and transliteration. 
Straight off he could have shown he was going to be totally faithful. Why not show us the beautiful 
picture of the magical axe, which when we go hunting for it on his own ETCSL baby (c573.4) we 
(hazin, see 𒅔). What a shame. Jeremy must have known the signs 

find 
intimately, and could have told us so much about his personal findings on their evolution and little 
things to look for in the pictures. Likewise with The Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture – with 
a title that highlights the word cuneiform, yet way less than 1% actually shows signs. Really there 
should have been at least a chapter about the 300 most common Sumerian cuneiform. Nope, just 
some 800 pages of English phonetic script. And incredibly expensive. Yet you can find much of it 
around the Net (see Google Books for starters) and some fair dinkum cuneophiles share their 
contributions for free, like Frans van Koppen's Chapter 7 The Scribe of the Flood Story and His 
Circle at academia.com (a backup of the MUGSAR is there too). 

.. 

The scribes who invented writing 5000 years ago clearly had no inhibitions about the basis for the 
design of their cuneiform, nor should we bowdlerize [etym.: Thomas Bowdler expurgated William Shakespeare 
(aka Edward de Vere) '1822] for hypocritical luddites / puritans who are still happy to plagiarize the 
technology revolution started by the Sumerians, and it may well have been the inspiration for the 
whole style ~ cunei.form = cuneus writing.  

Scratching and dragging a pointed stylus would not have been near as effective and enduring for us 
to be able to read now. And it can be no coincidence that the Sumerian apotheosis of 'woman' 
through the cuneus -shaped v sign has come down to us as the first letter of vagina, a fundamental 
example of our True Etymology campaign. 

.. 

To top it off, at long last, for the many frustrated cuneophiles out there, comes the nifty MUGSAR 
QuickFinder Index. Can you find an elite university that nifty? 

Oh, and if any nuts were looking for evidence that these first great civilizations got some help from 
aliens ...well, your first glance at the arrangement of many signs sure reminds one of spaceships, 

docking modules, rocket thruster exhausts – take a look at 𒈗 
spaceship man! As you would expect for the King of the Sumerians / "Kings of the Earthlings". 
LUGAL King he's in a 

Seriously though, enduring Sumerian picture script on tablets offers us a lot more than say Greek 
phonetic writing on papyrus (much of it disintegrated almost immediately). One might first say that 
for starters the Greeks were much more intellectual. But how much of the basics were plagiarized 
from the Sumerians.  

With the tablets we have a conduit, like electrons through a main circuit travelling at the speed of 
light straight back 5000 years ago. Analogous to astronomers and their powerful telescopes peering 
back into the evolution of galaxies (now there's an aptly interesting True Etymology – see 𒃲 
GAL big) and the universe. The pictures the scribes have transmitted on those tablets impress a 
profound insight into exactly how the people of the first civilization were thinking. Even with only 
a basic familiarity with the meanings of the logograms, it can be like watching timeshifted live 
video. Much more fascinating than the most expensive Steven Speilberg blockbuster but then what's 
a movie without a scriptwriter, and we're talking about the very first writers ever, who put down the 
motifs of Gilgamesh and Inana. 

Stop a moment and think about it. Put the huge amount of time in perspective. In that time many 
cultures did not develop writing at all, some had it and lost it. When plagio-religio somehow began 
to dominate the Romans the West was plunged into the Dark Ages, ironically only a bunch of 
monks were allowed to rehash one group of stories with a flood story, etc., plagiarized from guess 
where. Writing has really only started to make a comeback in the last few hundred years after the 
Renaissance / Enlightenment (even Guillem Shaksper's Stratford daughter couldn't write). That's less than 10% of the 
timeline back to the Sumerians. 

So at the next party you can say "I like movies" or "I'm studying a second language, French..." or 

you can say, "I'm a collaborator on the MUGSAR ... a nifty little 
Jobs!) we are developing so anyone can watch the Sumerians walking around 5000 years ago..." 
(they had it a bit before Steve

WANTED: Home School / University 

To be the official school / university home for MUGSAR, the niftiest Cuneiform Dictionary in the 
world, and show up the shortcomings of University of Oxford et al. Every elite educational 
institution needs to be able to show prospective students, and their parents, that they have 
something special to offer, not just in general social sciences, but the oldest written language. A 
semester introductory course to Sumerian cuneiform revolving around our MUGSAR would kick 
things off.  

For proof of 'niftiest', compare the others, see which one gives the quickest introductory grasp and 
familiarity with the actual Sumerian cuneiform. 

Oxford has theirs under 'Faculty of Oriental Studies'. A bit degrading since the West plagiarized so 
much from the Sumerians. We would designate ours, 'Faculty of True Origins' which would not 
only update the MUGSAR with more 4-Way translations but would also be the official publisher of 
the world's first True Etymology Dictionary tracing word roots back 2000+ years beyond Greek and 
Latin to Sumerian. All very prestigious indeed.  

It would be nice if MUGSAR's home could be our local University of NSW, with affiliation to a 
high school where Tara might be going ('2015-Year 7) like Sydney Girls or Randwick Girls. But it if 
they don't see the potential international prestige, who knows maybe Melbourne, or even in in 
another country. 

Foundation / Benefactors – assigned a cuneiform sign in our Main Listings forever 

At some point it would probably be a good idea to set up a Foundation. Such a not-for-profit entity 
with a university appointed board of trustees would ensure development in perpetuity. Funding is 
also important. Apparently PSD ran out of funding in ’2006, then development seemed to come to a 
halt. In particular it lacks unicodes put in place by ‘ICE’ not long after. Many altruistic endeavours 
seek straight out donations from benefactors, who get no significant recognition in return. What we 
could do is assign a Sumerian cuneiform sign in our Main Listings to a benefactor – a label would 
appear in the entry indicating, "The Xxxxxx Family MUGSAR Benefactors 𒀔CT". Thus that 
family would effectively achieve a degree of immortality, as long as there is Civilization Time. 
Something like what apparently happens in some areas of astronomy where a newly discovered star 
is named after a benefactor. Obviously signs would have different values, depending on how old 
they are, number of attestations, etc. High value ones would be particularly prestigious, for 
example, 

𒀀 
[The icon used is niĝul, an everlasting possession;𒃻 niĝ2 possession + 𒌌 ul distant time] 

The Xxxxxx Family 𒀔CT} 
A vowel; water… {

Signs could be offered to benefactors in blocks, depending on funding required. Compound entries 
could also be assigned, as well as special sections of MUGSAR, particularly Major Lemma and 
QuickFinder. These could be made available at a fixed value or auctioned off at a special fund-
raising / promotional MUGSAR Convention, perhaps held annually.  

Heck, even dispossessed families like ours could be assigned some immortality pixels somewhere, 
including obscure variants that may still become more valuable for compound-making; and even 
turning graphics like the cover into a 10x10 pixel mosaic with each plot also offered for family 
immortality.

Of course, the shame is not on the student, we all know where the social responsibility lies when we 
are talking about the oldest written language – the first schools, the founders of education. So we 
can just as easily substitute, "What kind of teacher / professor /  dean / principal / chancellor / 
school / university / education department director / culture..."

How to use 

The Main Listings follow same order as the standard cuneiform unicode (alpha-numeric) column 
after column (why didn't the powers that be just keep the codes sequentially all numeric?!). If you only have the 
sign try Major Lemma, then the QuickFinder Index.  
First lemma (reading / syllable) after grapheme is usually the 'sign name', sometimes the Sumerian 
name as well, as are any other readings / aliases after that. 
Gradually adding compounds.  
Cuneiform fonts have been replaced with jpg graphics because some tablets do not display them. 
Clearer shots of logograms will come eventually, for now use ScriptSource (click on first result for 
even bigger size) or Google Images (e.g. "unicode 𒃶").  

And the MUGSAR is proudly, and primarily, a Sumerian dictionary of the first writers, not Akkadian, 
Babylonian nor Hittite ones. So we pretty much are only interested in lemma that go back to at least 
Ur III (8000CT / 4000ya). Nor lemma that have 0x attestations. Again there are some great lexicons 
around but they include a big chunk of this latter stuff, when plagiarizing the Sumerians was in full 
swing. And don't even show attestations, nor you know what... it's bad enough that there are no 
signs, but to think that much is not even Sterling-Sumerian, or rarely used, well.  

You may notice with sign evolution, that it goes from the proto drawings to the cool Sumerian 
cuneiform, and then about 1000 years after them the fanastic pictures are lost through over 
simplification and the move to bland phonetic script. Who wants to look at that kind of dictionary.  

Some may say the first writers are lacking more intellectual concepts. But maybe those can still 
come. There's two ways for them to still make it into MUGSAR one day: 1) such cuneiform may 
eventually be unearthed 2) as we take in so many awesome signs gathered together on one *QF* 
screen (not java programmed all over the place – will PSD be as easy as the MUGSAR to pass on to 
future generations via the Internet Archive?!) the more familiar we get with the way Sumerian (not 
Akkadian, Greek, Roman et al) scribes were thinking 4-5000 years ago, then you know what we 
could be capable of? If we can start thinking like a scribe, why shouldn't we be able to pick up the 
stylus, and carry on their work, by fusing any missing intellectual cuneiform, including rendering of 
new technology terms. 

And so, that's why we are proudly snobs of MUGSAR!

MUGSAR file format convert tips 

Kindle (Paperwhite) is our favoured eReader (trying to get away from couch potato game-tempting, bright screened, hotter, heavier, 
battery-sucking tablets was part of the inspiration for MUGSAR). Just send (to your username@kindle.com) our Word .docx file (you 
can find the latest upload here) 'as is' [Do NOT add "convert" to the subject line, it stuffs it up] straight to your Kindle – it comes up 
just perfect. Kindle now uses .kf8 (aka .azw3) cf. the old .azw / .mobi 

PDF - Though still very common for now, has many limitations, esp as a source format for conversion – Calibre FAQs say it's a crap 
format: "In order of decreasing preference: LIT, MOBI, AZW, EPUB, AZW3 (aka KF8), FB2, DOCX, HTML, PRC, ODT, RTF, 
PDB, TXT, PDF". 

ePUB - The most common eReader format is ePUB, and even better, it's 'open source'. MUGSAR ePUB version is now available 
from the Internet Archive. 

Free Convert Software - The most popular seems to be Calibre. Though some say that you can't use .docx as a source format, it now 
does | calibre-ebook.com/download | manual.calibre-ebook.com/conversion | browsingrhino.com...calibres-great-conversion-docx | 
Main steps:1. Add books [select .docx file] 2. Convert books [Some important selections] Output format: EPUB [or pref.] Page Setup:

to be stuck on all that micro$oft crap at 47 or 67%]) Right click - save to disk single file - then select EPUB only. Then that ePUB is 
your best source for other formats. But first load it in, right click and use the Editor to fix up any bugs. As for converting to mobi, 
found Calibre far superior to Kindlegen (or Kindle for PC) – Kindlegen doubled the file size to over 16mb, bloated the graphics, some 
now not fitting the screen; and lost the TOC and cover. Calibre came up great, and actually reduced the file size.

A curious development from EME [𒅴 tongue] 'voice-emit' = 'make a sound' is found in Jaritz #721, which 
depicts a 'sail with rigging' [cf. harbinger for antenna, radio signal] and reads *îm(i) (for *îm(i)); it means 'wind, storm-wind'; i.e. 'moaning (of the wind), pars pro toto' [a part (taken) for the whole]. Strong support for this analysis is furnished by another meaning attached to this sign: 'fear'; this is understandable for 'moaning' but not for simply 'wind' or 'storm(-wind)'. 'Moaning' has attracted the reading 
ni2 [𒉎 ] 'be afraid', 'fear', which represents 'snivel-stative-like' = 'sniveling' = 'fear'.

Jaritz #889 depicts a 'short vertical line abutting a longer horizontal line at its midpoint'. It means 'speak, call, tongue, 
middle, converse'. Graphic convention designed to bring out the idea of 'middle', the position associated in early thinking with the 
placement of the tongue in the mouth. Somewhat surprisingly, this simple element has been identified for PIE as *me, 'in the 
middle, into the middle'. *me is not regarded as meaning 'tongue'; that meaning has been taken by a derivation from it, eme (for 

*îmî) [𒅴

he was setup by another forgotten proto-feminist, 2nd wife Elizabeth Trentham]; she represented a strong and creative personality, an 

educated woman, and one who fulfilled diverse roles in a complex society, not unlike women's aspirations today...[Jane Roberts]; 

"My goddess gave birth to your god" ... Assyriologist William Hallo referred to her as "The Sumerian Shakespeare". But given that 

she preceded Shakespeare by several thousand years, it might be more apt to dub the bard "The English Enheduanna" [Kristin

SHE / ŠE | niga, nigu = [28315x!] barley, grain; unit of length / area / volume / weight; shekel | 

𒊺 
True Etymology: origin of Hebrew term for money 'she-kel' re price of bushel of grain | niga [𒕥x] = to be 
fattened 

"Money, like certain other essential elements in civilization, is a far more ancient institution than we were taught to believe ... the 
oldest coin currency that we know is a Sumerian bronze piece dating from before 7000CT / 3000plagio.  

 

On one side of the coin is a representation of a sheaf of wheat, and on the other, Ishtar, the goddess of fertility. 

The Sumerians called it the "Shekel" where "She" meant wheat, "Kel" [𒂆] was a measurement similar to a bushel, hence this coin 
was a symbol of a value of one bushel of wheat. (The word "shekel" survives in modern Hebrew as Israel's monetary unit.) The 
original shekel had as its purpose payment for sacred prostitution at the temple of Ishtar, which was the temple of life and death. The 
temple, as well as being a ritual center, was the storage place for the reserves of wheat that supported the priesthood, and also the 
community in lean times. So farmers fulfilled their religious and social obligations by bringing their contributions of wheat to the 
temple, and receiving in exchange a shekel coin, entitling them to a visit with the temple prostitutes at the festival time. All this also 
must be understood in its cultural context: The sacred prostitutes were representatives of the goddess, and intercourse with them was 
intercourse with the goddess of fertility herself, nothing to take lightly..." The Future of Money, Bernard Lietaer '1997 
.. 
"...coinage was arranged according to the sexagesimal numbering system developed earlier by the Sumerians (ie 1, 60 [1x60], and 
3600 [𒊹 (60x60]) ....lowest denomination was a “shekel”, then a “mina” [𒈾] and finally a “talent” [𒄘]  
1 mina = 60 shekels. 1 talent = 60 mina [3600 shekels]. The mina weighted about 500 gms., and the talent about 30 kgs.  
These coins were used to pay for property, buy goods and services, pay fines, pay taxes, etc. 
Some examples of the use of the shekel from one of the later law codes inscribed on the cuneiform tablets: 
“The price of one gur [𒄥] of barley is one shekel of silver’. 
 “The price of 2 gurs of salt is one shekel of silver”. 
“The price of one hal [𒄬] seed is one shekel of silver”. 
“The wage of a labourer is one shekel of silver and his food one ban of barley and he has to serve for this wage for one month”... 
some information on the relative value of the coins and the wealth that each represented. The scribe is lauding the benevolent king for 
his protection of the poor. “He saw to it that ... the man of one shekel did not fall a prey to the man of one mina (sixty shekels) ..."

Sumerians – Kings of the Earthlings 

Firstly, the issue over the more correct cuneiform. Clearly, it make much more sense that 'gi' 𒄀 reed stylus 
(writing => knowledge => power; reed marsh of Tigris and Euphrates delta) should be the one we use. Rather than the much 
less used non-Sumerian, later Babylonian 'gir15' 𒂠 (local), as shown at PSD for the individual logogram, 
4900x to 7x, and the compound for Sumerian language 'eme.gi' 21x over 'eme.gir15' only 1x, in the older period. 

And similarly for tablets refering to the King of Sumer, mainly use 
e.g. the famous Ur-Nammu tablet (see below, also ETCSL, e.g.1: Poem Išme-Dagan (c.2.5.4.01), line c25401.A.364; e.g.2: 
"Then the Martu peoples, who know no agriculture, arose in all Sumer...", c1822.369). So why do the elites misquote the 
cuneiform sign actually used?! 
'ki.en.gi', rather than ki.en.gir15 

Also see Proto Language Monosyllables – Patrick Ryan clearly knows what he is talking about, "...Emegi, the language of 
males in Sumer, differs in some interesting ways from equivalent forms in Emesal, the language of females..." 

[𒅴 'eme' = tongue, language + 𒄀 GI reed / write] 

One can imagine that the Sumerians were dominant and respected by other states because they could write, 
hence the emphasis on reed stylus. Thus they were looked on as, "Kings of the Earthlings because the stylus is 
mightier than the sword".

Ninlil glad. Enlil and Ninlil relished it there. In its great dining hall, the trustworthy hero chosen by Nunamnir 
made them enjoy a magnificent meal: the E-kur was rejoicing. They looked with approval at the shepherd Ur-
Namma, and the Great Mountain decreed a great destiny for Ur-Nammu for all time, making him the mightiest 
among his black-headed people.

Like a springing reed, I leapt up and put myself to work. 

I did not depart from my teacher's instructions,  
and I did not start doing things on my own initiative.  

My mentor was delighted with my work on the assignment.  

He rejoiced that I was humble before him and he spoke in my favour."

Ecology of the Erotic in a Myth of Inanna Judy Grahn  
Inanna went into the mountains and began flying around. From one border of the territory to the other, she flew 
round and round. She flew around the Tree whose roots intertwine with the horizon of heaven, by now so tired 
that she lay down beside its boundary roots. She had in her loincloth a weaving of the seven cosmic powers, 
across her thighs. Her thoughts were with her shepherd lover, Dumuzid. On the same plot of land a youth, 
Šukaletuda, was working, and saw her; he approached, untied the loincloth of divine powers...

It was only in '1949, in an article of the volume XVII of the Archiv Oreintalni called A Blood-Plague Motif in 
Sumerian Mythology, that Samuel Noah Kramer translated for the first time this myth...[more]

The Literature of Ancient Sumer edited Jeremy A. Black 

.. 

"Inana needed to pass through the seven gates of the 'abzu' (abyss), and was not allowed to pass through unless 
she removed an article of clothing / jewelry for each of gate. Her clothes were symbolic of her divine power, 
thus she was systematically weakened in this fashion. By the time she arrived in the inner palace, she was 
almost naked and almost dead..." [more]

Some well funded universities like Oxford's Oriental Institute ETCSL et al have everything separated, don't 
give unicodes at all, and for the sign they link off to PSD (University of Pennsylvania) where it is often not 
clear which is the relevant one. And their translations are superficial, probably computer generated. When you 
work with the actual cuneiform signs, rather than just impotent readings using our boring English phonetic 
script, you start to see that the scribes were not just telling a story, but literally painting the scene.  
When we start going deeper than such misleading translations it becomes very revealing...

As a temple whore or harlot one of Shamhat's several duties would be to have sex in the temple with paying 'Johns' or 'Customers', 
said funds being 'donated/ to the temple's upkeep. Below, a drawing after a lead votive offering found in a temple showing a 'John' 
having sex with a naked priestess atop an altar with a special incline to accomodate the act of sex. Inanna / Ishtar [ Eash-tar => Easter 
fertility goddess] fulfilled many roles, she was the 'Courtesan of Heaven' ('polite' scholarly language for a whore or prostitute) and 
wives beseeched her aid in becoming pregnant.  
 

"... figurines depicting intercourse, the man stands and the woman always rests upon a high structure, usually interpreted as an altar. 
These figurines may very likely represent ritual intercourse...they are probably in some way associated with the cult of Inana / Ishtar 
as goddess of physical love and prostitution, and were, in fact found in her temple at Asshur..." [Black & Green] 

... Adam and Eve in the Garden in Eden [a straight lifting from the Sumerians see 𒂔 – the original too cool sounding to use an 
inferior replacement name] being a later recasting of Enkidu and Shamhat ... thus nothing more than a recasting and sanitizing of an 
earlier 'ribald' Sumerian story about 'Whores and their Johns'  

For more see Walter Reinhold Warttig Mattfeld on plagiarism of Enkidu and the Temple Courtesan Shamhat from the Epic of 
Gilgamesh for much later Adam and Eve editing; and p. 152. 'Prostitution and Ritual Sex' Jeremy Black and Anthony Green. Gods,

Museum Press. London. '1992. And the money side see 𒊺 shekel.

The song of lettuce, t.4.08.05  

[4-Way to come] 

Vigorously he sprouted, vigorously he sprouted and sprouted, water it - it being lettuce! 

In his black garden of the desert bearing much yield did my darling of his mother, 

My barley stalk full of allure in its furrow, water it - it being lettuce, 

Did my one - a very apple tree bearing fruit at the top – water it - it being a garden! 

The honey-sweet man, the honey-sweet man, was doing sweet (things) to me! 

My lord, the honey-sweet man, the godly one, my darling of his mother, 

His hands honey sweet, his feet honeying, was doing sweet (things) to me! 
His limbs being sweet his feet honeying, was doing sweet (things) to me! 

His limbs being sweet, sweet honey, he was doing sweet things to me! 

O my one who of a sudden was doing sweet (things) to the 
whole (insides up) to the navel, my darling of his mother, 

My desert-honey loins, darling of his mother, you watered it - it being lettuce! 

The lettuce, mentioned in these texts (hi-izsar [𒄭]) is probably Lactuta sativa... In Sumerian texts it is generally associated with 
cuneus.. Jacobson thought it represented the pubic hair. Maybe the visual aspect is less important here, although the overlapping 
leaves and their texture, as well as milky or clear sap, are quite evocative, lettuces and similar fast growing vegetables, like cucumbers 
and melons, all of which were grown in Mesopotamian gardens, require frequent watering ... association with water might also have 
contributed to the metaphorical range: the cuneus, like lettuce, is said to need the 'watering' ... 

We have seen that làl ('honey') is frequently used to describe sensual pleasure. The expression 'to taste the honey-plant' was a common 
euphemism for intercourse. Here the lover is equated with the sensation he brings - his very limbs are 'honey', they 'bring sweetness', 
orgasmic enjoyment. The metaphor extends from activity ('to do the sweet thing [same sign 𒄭 HI]') and personal attributes 
('whose limbs are honey') to the location... This 'honey' was date-syrup rather than the bees' product. 

.. 

A balbale to Inana, t.4.08.4, alternative translation Alster 1993: 

The brother makes me enter his house: 

He made me lie on a honey-smelling bed, 

After my precious, dear one, had lain by my heard, 

One-by-one, making "tongues", one by one, 

My brother of the fairest face made fifty. 

He became (?) like a silenced man 

With an 'earthquake' he was put to silence. 
My brother, with a hand put on his waist,  
My precious, sweet one, the time passes! 
(Lover:) Se me free, my sister, set me free! 

Come, my beloved sister, let us go to the palace (var. to our house)! 

May you be a little daughter in my father's eyes!" 

Leick gives the Sumerian of one of the lines in part because of its 'delightful resonances': 

dili-dili-ta eme-ak dili-dili-ta 

One by one - making tongues - one by one 

'eme-ak' (tongue making) usually implies speaking, chatting (the proverbial 'sweet nothings'?). But it could also have, as Alster duly 
noted, a double meaning, and imply lovemaking. The following lines speak in favor of a sexual meaning, as the 'brother' is silenced by 
an 'earthquake' - surely a reference to an orgasm - although Inanna is willing to continue this form of passing time. Again the scenario 
is one of pre-martial love making, with the man expressing his desire to formulate their sexual union, since the last line explicitly says 
that a girl should become a daughter-in-law to his father. The text is imbued with a sense of irony, that the inexperienced ki-sikil is 
well able to exhaust the ardour of her lover, even rather overtaking his virility." 

cf. Oath of Women (A balbale to Inana Dumuzid B) t.4.08.02 

My juicy, grape, my honey sweet... 

May you put your right hand in my cuneus, 

With your left stroke my head, 

When you have brought your mouth close to my mouth, 

When you have taken my lips in your mouth, 

By so doing you wil swear an oath to me... 

etcsl.orinst.oxc40802.21 

21-26. You are to place your right hand on my cuneus 
while your left hand rests on my head,  
bringing your mouth close to my mouth,  

and taking my lips in your mouth:  
thus you shall take an oath for me.  

This is the oath of women

Gudea Cylinders 

4-Way Ninĝirsu's Temple | 4-Way top | TOC2 

The Gudea cylinders are a pair of terracotta cylinders dating to circa 7875 CT [2125 plag] on which is written in 
cuneiform a Sumerian myth called the Building of Ningursu's temple.[1] The cylinders were found in '1877 
during excavations at Telloh (ancient Girsu), Iraq and are now displayed in the Louvre in Paris, France. They 
are the largest cuneiform cylinders yet discovered and contain the longest known text written in the Sumerian 
language... [Wik] 

The god of wisdom, Enki, organized the world after creation and gave each deity a role in the world order. 
Nisaba was named the scribe of the gods, and Enki then built her a school of learning so that she could better 
serve those in need. 

Nidaba / Nindaba / Nisaba = goddess of writing (and teaching) she was often praised by Sumerian scribes. 

Many clay-tablets end with the phrase 
“Nisaba be praised” to honor the goddess. She is considered the teacher of both mortal scribes and other divine 
deities... 
DINGIR.NAGA.ZAG.SAL, dnisaba za3-mi2, 

As the goddess of knowledge, she is related to many other facets of intellectual study and other gods may turn 
to her for advice or aid. Some of these traits are shared with her sister Ninsina. She is also associate with grain,

Sumer Periods  

Ubaid = 5000-6000CT (5000-4000 religio-plagio) – Early settlements in Sumer (southern Iraq).  

Uruk = 6000-7000CT (4000-3000 plag) – Civilization develops rapidly through cuneiform writing.  

Early Dynastic = 7000-7650CT (3000-2350 plag) – Independent, sometimes conflicting Sumerian city 
states. [Literature of Ancient Sumer, Jeremy Black] 

ED IIIa = The Early Dynastic IIIa (Fara) period - c.7400-7500CT (2600-2500 plag) 

ED IIIb period = c. 7460-7650CT (2540-2350 plag) 

The Early Dynastic period began after a cultural break with the preceding Jemdet Nasr period that 
has been radio-carbon dated to about [7100CT (2900 plag)] at the beginning of the Early Dynastic I 
Period. No inscriptions have yet been found verifying any names of kings that can be associated 
with the Early Dynastic I period. The ED I period is distinguished from the ED II period by the 
narrow cylinder seals of the ED I period and the broader wider ED II seals engraved with banquet 
scenes or animal-contest scenes. The Early Dynastic II period is when Gilgamesh, the famous king 
of Uruk, is believed to have reigned. Later inscriptions have been found bearing some Early 
Dynastic II names from the King List. The Early Dynastic IIIa period is when syllabic writing 
began. Accounting records and an undeciphered logographic script existed before the Fara Period, 
but the full flow of human speech was first recorded around [7400CT (2600plag)] at the beginning of 
the Fara Period.  

Hegemony, which came to be conferred by the Nippur priesthood, alternated among a number of 
competing dynasties, hailing from Sumerian city-states traditionally including Kish, Uruk, Ur, Adab 
and Akshak, as well as some from outside of southern Mesopotamia, such as Awan, Hamazi, and 
Mari, until the Akkadians, under Sargon of Akkad, overtook the area... 

Ur III = The Third Dynasty of Ur: 107 years, 7954-8061CT (2047–1940 plag)  
[cf. 108 years, 7888-7996CT (2112–2004 plag) - Black, ibid.] 

Also known as the Neo-Sumerian Empire or the Ur III Empire, refers to a Sumerian ruling dynasty 
based in the city of Ur and a short-lived territorial-political state that some historians regard as a 
nascent empire... [Wik] 

The Third Dynasty of Ur came to preeminent power in Mesopotamia after several centuries of 
Akkadian and Gutian kings. It controlled the cities of Isin, Larsa and Eshnunna and extended as far 
north as the Jazira. 

The Third Dynasty of Ur arose some time after the fall of the Akkad Dynasty. The period between 
the last powerful king of the Akkad Dynasty, Shar-kali-sharri, and the first king of Ur III, Ur-
Nammu, is not well documented, but most Assyriologists posit that there was a brief "dark age", 
followed by a power struggle among the most powerful city-states... [Wik]

LAK (proto list) 

(Liste der archaischen Keilschriftzeichen 1922 WVDOG 40, Berlin)  

http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/tools/SignLists/LAK/HTML/P0001.html 

(UCLA Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative) 

LAK is a dictionary of Sumerian cuneiform signs of the pre-classical Fara period (Early Dynastic 
II), published in '1922 by Sumerologist P. Anton Deimel ('1865–'1954). The list enumerates 870 
distinct cuneiform signs. 

The sign inventory in the archaic period was considerably larger than the standard inventory of texts 
of the classical Sumerian (7400-7650CT [2600-2350plag]) or Neo-Sumerian (7900CT; all 
dates short chronology) periods. This means that numerous signs identified by their classical 
reading continue several distinct signs of the pre-classical period. If it is necessary to identify the 
pre-classical sign intended, its LAK number is customarily given, in the form of LAK-1 to LAK-
870 [Wik] :

TRUE ETYMOLOGY 

In addition to individual entries throughout the MUGSAR, here we will start throwing in extra bits and pieces 
until we can get a feel for order... 

Proto Language Monosyllables PLM 

'Proto Language Monosyllables PLM with their Principal Meanings', Patrick C. Ryan ('2008) – "The Proto-
Language was composed of 90 monosyllables..."  

Some quite interesting points on true etymology and evolution. 

Also notes "...one  of the defining characteristics of Emesal is to eliminate from the 'female language' those 
sounds which would necessitate observable lip-rounding, presumably for whatever social significance observed 
lip-rounding by females may have had. Emegi [EG] u => Emesal [ES] i ..." 

PIE = Proto-Indo-European 

Refers often to Kurt Jaritz Schriftarchäologie der altmesopotamischen Kultur ( '1967)

Abbreviations / Notations 

[740x] = number of times attested – as noted by ePSD – it's important to note that a number of the 
signs (esp the hundreds of repetitive variants) in the standard lists were rarely used. 

[~ xxx!] = very large number e.g. 𒆠  
KI (gi5) [32379xxx!] = cosmic world... 

uQQ = unicode query – number? 

gunû and šeššig  

One method of generating new signs was to mark a portion of a base sign to  specify the object 
intended. The marks are called by the scribes either gunû-strokes (from Sumerian gùn-a 'colored, 
decorated') or šeššig- hatchings (due to the resemblance of the strokes to the early cross-hatched  
form of the Sumerian sign for grain, še). Compare the following two sets of  signs: 
 In the first set, the base sign is saĝ 'head'. Strokes over the mouth portion  produces SAĜ-gunû, to 
be read ka 'mouth'. In the second set, the base sign is  da 'side' (i.e., a shoulder, arm and hand). 
Hatchings over the arm portion  produces DA-šeššig, to be read á 'arm'... [Foxvog] 

CVVE = compound verb verbal element (PSD) 

PLM = Proto Language Monosyllables (see True Etym.)

.. 

We do not know how Sumerian was spoken. Scribes were trained for over two years to become 
competent in Sumerian, the basis of the cuneiform writing system. The Sumerian cuneiform writing 
system consists of around 700 signs, which could represent both words and syllables. We must 
learn the language as well as the way it was written. Cuneiform is full of mysteries; it became 
increasingly complex over the three thousand years of its development, and its adepts utilized these 
complexities for esoteric teaching and speculation. While we cannot hope to duplicate the training 
or the native knowledge of the scribes, we must try in some way to make their teaching our own. 
We must begin by saying what they said, pronouncing what they pronounced. Although we cannot 
be certain how the languages were spoken, there are three ways to reconstruct pronunciation: 

1. Comparing contemporary descended or related languages 

2. Ancient transliterations or phonological discussions from the unknown to a known language 

3. Borrowings from the unknown to a known language 

Sumerian has no known descendants or relatives, so we must rely entirely on point number 2. 
Sumerian was written with the same set of characters, and for 2000 years... We work from the 
pronunciation of Akkadian back to the Sumerian. Finally, we are fairly confident of the quality of 
Sumerian vowels - whether it is an a, e, i, u (even perhaps o) - we have very little idea of 
the quantity - long or short, high or low, etc. 

The following guide to Sumerian is therefore purely practical: 

a short as in "bat," or long as in "father" 

â long as in "father" 

b as in "babble" 

d as in English 

e short as in "bet" 

e sometimes long as in "day" 

g hard as in English "gag" 

ĝ nasal "ng" as in "thing" 

ḫ rough [throaty] "h", no English equivalent 

i short as in "sit" 

i sometimes long as in "ski" 

k always hard as in "kick" 

l as in English 

m same as English 

n same as English 

p same as English 

r same as English, can be flat or rolled 

s same as English 

š like "sh" in "ship" 

t as in English 

u short as in "cut" 

u sometimes long as in "ruby" 

z as in English 

There are two diphthongs: 

"ia" pronounced "ee-yah" or "ya" 

"ai" pronounced "ah-ee" or like the word "aye" 

If any other two vowels come together, pronounce them like they are both the first vowel.
