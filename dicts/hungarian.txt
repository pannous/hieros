1. Foreword


1. Foreword
This “Etymological Dictionary of Hungarian” – for which I propose the abbreviation “EDH” – is
based on the assumption that the Hungarian (Magyar) language is the direct successor of Sumerian.
With this assumption – for which the present author is convinced that there is enough evidence
(cf. Chapters 2 and 3) -, EDH strongly competes with and contradicts the traditional Hungarian
etymological dictionaries, that are based on the assumption that Hungarian belongs to the Finno-Ugric
(FU) languages:

Obviously, each 10 or 20 years, there was a need for a new (and expensive) multi-volumes etymological
dictionary of Hungarian, that is very singular, since it happened in no other known language.
-1-

1. Foreword

Furthermore, if one compares the “crucial words” – alleged borrowings from Slavonic or Turkic and
words of “unknown” or “doubtful origin” -, one will find, as a rule, in each of the fore-mentioned
dictionaries quite different etymologies (cf. Chapter 4).
All these dictionaries are ordered alphabetically according to the Hungarian lemma and none of these
books are written in English. EDH, however, differs in two ways from the already published
etymological dictionaries of Hungarian: Firstly, it is written in English that is more widespread than
Hungarian or German. Secondly, EDH is also ordered alphabetically according to the Hungarian
lemma, but separately for each language or language family: Sumerian and Hungarian (Chapter 5),
Hungarian and the other Finno-Ugric languages (Chapter 6), Caucasian and Hungarian (Chapter 7),
Bantu and Hungarian (Chapter 8), Etruscan and Hungarian (Chapter 9), Tibeto-Burman and Hungarian
(Chapter 10), Munda languages (Chapter 11), Dravidian languages and Hungarian (Chapter 12), Chinese
and Hungarian (Chapter 13), Japanese and Hungarian (Chapter 14), Turkish and Hungarian (Chapter

15), Austronesian and Hungarian (16), Mayan Languages and Hungarian (Chapter 17).
A chapter about conclusions (Chapter 18) and two indices (Chapters 19 and 20) conclude EDH.
The fundament of all comparisons between Hungarian and Sumerian is the complete list, given in
Chapter 5, from Colman-Gabriel Gostony’s “Dictionnarie d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975), a
milestone for Sumerian-Hungarian research. This means: We do not take as a basis a regular Hungarian
dictionary and compare all or some of its words with the words in a dictionary of another language,
disregarding sound-laws and operating on kling-klang-etymologies. We set as only fact the hypothesis,
that the 1042 etymologies in Gostony (1975) are correct, since they have never been disproved. In
other words: We reduce the many then-thousands of Hungarian words of the following three best
dictionaries:
●

to a relative small common Sumerian-Hungarian basis of 1042 entries and compare this list with the
already mentioned languages: A word from another languages enters the list only, if it corresponds with
one of the 1042 words and no other Hungarian word than one of these 1042 will be compared to
another language, even if they are plenty of examples to be found in the extremely rich SumerianHungarian literature (cf. Chapter 2). The only exception is Etruscan (cf. Chapter 9), being a
corpus-language with an extremely restricted vocabulary. Of course, comparing three instead of two
-2-

1. Foreword

languages also reduces massively the chance of mistaken etymologies. For the sound rules I refer to
from which we have taken our data, for the other parts, but I do not repeat the sound-rules here neither do the FU dictionaries. Yet, almost all of the works used in EDH can be found in a big
university library in America and in Europa or borrowed via interloan.
All the maps that are used in this book are copyrighted by Wikipedia.
The author hopes that EDH will be able to establish itself as a reference work for all the peoples who
have always adhered to the Sumerian-Hungarian theory or do not believe anymore in FU and Uralic
linguistics. If EDH will cause some adherents of FU/Uralic linguistics to convert to SumerianHungarian linguistics, then it has reached more than its author ever could hope.
Finally, I give EDH two sad, but true quotations by two of the greatest Sumerian-Hungarian
researchers on its way:
Spread the word and be not surprised if you are assailed, perhaps even by people
who call themselves Hungarians.
(Ida Bobula, Budapest 1900 – Gaffney, SC, USA, 1981)
Mert nem az az igaz, ami igaz, hanem amit a világ igaznak – tart.
(Because not that is true, what is true, but what the world – holds for true.)
(Viktor Padány, Vatta (Borsod) 1906 – Melbourne, Australia 1963)

2. Introduction into Sumarian-Hungarian research


2. Introduction into
Sumerian-Hungarian research

1. Preliminary remarks
Sumerian-Hungarian research has at least four drawbacks: First, there is – unlike in Finno-Ugristics and
Uralistics - no complete bibliography of Sumerian-Hungarian studies, although the literature is
enormous. Second, because during the communist era Sumerian-Hungarian research was forbidden in
Hungary, many publications had to appear abroad in more or less ephemeral journals and obscure
publishing houses. Third, the majority of these publications – again unlike FU- and Uralistic studies are written in Hungarian, so they are not understandable for most non-Hungarians. Fourth, there are
not only pearls amongst the Sumerian-Hungarian studies. Especially in linguistics, many works have
been written by non-linguists, even by non-academics. Therefore, this introduction has also the
purpose of leading the beginner to the scientifically valuable publications.

2. History of Sumerian-Hungarian research
The standard work that gives an overview of the beginnings of Sumerian-Hungarian research is:
●

Érdy, Miklós
The Sumerian, Ural-Altaic, Magyar Relationship: A History of Research
A sumír, ural-altaji, magyar rokonság története
Part I : The 19th Century
I. Rész: A 19. század
New York 1974

This work has the advantage, that it is bilingual (Hungarian and English), but the disadvantage, that
Part II (concerning the 20th century) never appeared. A relatively short, but reliable “substitute” for
Part II with a long bibliography is the following article:
●

Dombi, Charles (Károly)
The controversy on the origins and early history of the Hungarians
In: www.hunmgyar.org/tor/controve.htm

Here we learn the names of the decipherers of Sumerian who also connected it immediately to the
“Turanian” languages (the former name of the “Ural-Altaic” family), especially Hungarian: Edward
Hincks (1792-1866), François Lenormant (1837-1883), Jules Oppert (1825-1905) and Henry C.
Rawlinson (1792-1866). The decipherment of the Cuneiform writing, in which the two basic languages
of ancient Mesopotamia, Sumerian and Akkadian, were written between ca. 3000 – 400 B.C., was
started by Georg Friedrich Grotefend as early as in 1802, but only in 1850, Rawlinson finished it.
-4-

2. Introduction into Sumarian-Hungarian research

Therefore, before 1850, there is also no Sumerian-Hungarian research. But since (as we will see in
chapter 3), there are many Akkadian loanwords in Sumerian, one should never forget the following
work whose aim was to prove that Hungarian is related to the Semitic languages:
●

Kiss, Bálint
Magyar régiségek (Hungarian Antiquities)
Pest 1839

Hence, it is true, that the Finno-Ugric theory, initiated by János Sajnovics (1770) and Sámuel Gyarmathi
(1799) is older and competed with the still older theory of the Turkish origin of Hungarian, but it is
mistaken to speak about the so-called “second Hungarian-Turkish war” (“ a második Magyar-Török
háború”) after 1850. The connections established between the newly detected Sumerian and the
Hungarian language that were most strongly propagated by two non-Hungarians, the French
archeologist Lenormant and the German linguist Fritz Hommel (1854-1936), both university
professors, spread quickly all over the world and found their entrance f. ex. also in some editions of the
“Encyclopaedia Britannica” between 1860 and 1880.
But things changed: Already during the so-called Bach-era 1848-1859, but at last since the HungarianAustrian “Ausgleich” in 1867, the Habsburgs ordered Austrian and German professors for the chairs in
linguistics and history to Budapest. One of them was the German Josef Budenz who published on
behalf of the Viennese court between 1873 and 1881 his “Magyar-ugor összehasonlító szótár”
(“Comparative Hungarian-Ugric Dictionary”), where the long forgotten hypothesis of Sajnovics and
Gyarmathi was freshened up again. It is obvious, what the Habsburgs wanted to show: The
Hungarians, who were not more than slaves in the eyes of the Habsburgs, were not allowed to trace
their origins back to the Sumerians, the first high culture that existed on earth. Rather, a connection
with the Lapps, the Voguls and the Ostyaks, who lived in the 19th century still in the stone-Age, was
established. Political propaganda and banishment of the adherents of the Sumerian-Hungarian theory
helped a lot. After the downfall of the Austrian-Hungarian double-monarchy in 1918, the communists
took over Hungary already in 1919 under the leadership of Béla Kún, then extensively in 1945 and
from 1956-1989, so that the communists directly continued the Anti-Sumerian-Hungarian campaign
started by their enemies, the Habsburgs, since in the end, both the Habsburgs and the communists
agreed in their opinion that the Hungarians are subhuman creatures.
Nowadays, Finno-Ugristics is fully established, all Sumerian-Hungarian research is considered to be
“unscientific”, representatives of this theory are blacklisted, publishing in Hungary is possible, but still
difficult, because the communists are still sitting on key positions in all sectors of education (and
elsewhere). Yet, there is hope, since the chairs of the FU representatives started to shake already a
couple of years ago. The Tartu school of Uralistics has given up since a long time the concept of the
Uralic tree-model and thus the genetic relationship of the Uralic languages:
●

2. Introduction into Sumarian-Hungarian research

●

Marcantonio, Angela
The Uralic language Family: Facts, Myths and Statistics
Oxford 2002

László Marácz, like the two fore-mentioned scholars a university professor, has shown both in
Hungarian and in English, that in reality not the Sumerian-Hungarian, but the FU theory is unscientific:
●

Marácz, László
A finnugor elmélet tarthatatlansága nyelvészeti szempontból (Original of the following English
translation)
In: www.kitalaltkozepkor.hu/maracz_finnugor.html

●

Marácz, László
The untenability of the Finno-Ugrian theory from a linguistic point of view
In: www.acronet.net/~magyar/english/1997-3/JRNL97B.htm

Marácz has shown, that the FU theory is circular and thus unscientific: One proves, what one already
presupposes to have been proven. E.g. one compares only languages of the Finno-Ugric family in order
to “prove” that these languages belong to the Finno-Ugric family. Otherwise, no Finno-Ugrist could
refuse comparisons of Hungarian with Sumerian, Turkish, Japanese, etc. When the mathematician
Bertrand Russell proved Gottlob Frege in the end of the 19th century, that in his logic there is
circularity – the so-called Russell-paradox of a set of sets that either contains or does not contain
itself -, then this result had devastating consequences for mathematics, since mathematics was based
since Cantor on logic. Russell’s paradox thus did not only split set theory in two different set theories,
but changed the very fundament of mathematics (cf. e.g. the Bourbaki School). But nothing like that
happened until now in Finno-Ugristics. Even if circularity can be shown to a kindergarten child – for
example with Epimenides’ paradox: “I am lying” -, the vast majority of Finno-Ugrists do not show any
understanding.
Marácz showed also a real alternative to comparative historical reconstruction: the so-called “wordbushes” or “clusters”: One puts together words with identical or similar form and content and orders
them into bushes. This pure synchronic procedure is non-circular, because in an agglutinative language
like Hungarian there are no such phenomena like ablaut that involve previous diachronic knowledge in
synchronic analysis. One should not forget, either, that the method of historical reconstruction was
adopted from the Indo-European languages and successfully applied to the Semitic languages - because
both of them have ablaut, but it has not proven to be valuable for any other language family. Moreover,
in isolating languages like Chinese and the almost whole range of Austronesian languages between
Madagascar in the West and Easter Island in the East, one has no other possibility to decide, if two or
more words are genetically related or not, since in these languages we have to deal with monosyllabic
roots (and not to speak about the total absence of older texts in most of the latter languages). Here,
too, Marácz’s method applies: If a certain word is a member of a word-bush, then all the words, that
belong to this bush are genetically related to one another, but if it stays alone, then it must be a
borrowing. These bushes can be taken easily from the huge Hungarian dictionary by Czuczor and
Fogarasi:

(A privately bound big collection of photocopied typewritten essays that exist only in 1 copy in
the US: in the University of Chicago Library under the calling number PH2074.N686 1985.)

To use only with care are all works by Jós Ferenc Badiny (also known as Francisco Badiny Jos and
Francisco Jos Badiny). The best and only one written in a sort of English is:
●

Badiny, Francisco Jos
The Sumerian Wonder. With the collaboration of M. Brady, M. von Haynal, G. Enderlin and
Dr. E. Novotny

Characteristic of all of the many books and articles by Badiny is, that he presupposes a continuity
between Sumerian and Hungarian, i.e. according to him and his followers, Sumerian never died out,
and today’s Hungarian is thus nothing but a late form of Sumerian.
In the following, we will present an outline of the main points of Sumerian-Hungarian history from the
following article by Charles Dombi. (All quotations from Dombi, whose article is not paginated, are
marked; what is not marked, is by me, especially the passage about the Transilvanian origin of the
Sumerians: Dombi assumes that the Sumerians are autochthonous in Mesopotamia and wandered from
there to Transilvania):
●

The Hungarians trace their origin back to Nimrod, who lives in the Hungarian mythology as MénMarót (pseudo-etymologically influenced by Hung. mén “stallion”). He as his wife Eneth had two sons,
Magor and Hunor, who became the forefathers of the Magyars (Hungarians) and the Huns. The
standard works for Hungarian mythology are:

“Byzantine sources mention that the Magyars were also known as the Sabirs who originated from
Northern Mesopotamia, which was referred to as Subir-ki by the Sumerians who also originated from
this land. Numerous other ancient and medieval sources also refer to the Scythians, Huns, Avars and
Magyars as identical people. Independently from the various political regimes which have ruled over
Hungary and which have imposed the current official version of the origins and history of the
Hungarians, modern scientific and scholarly research has confirmed the Sumerian-Scythian-Hun-AvarMagyar ethnolinguistic relationship and continuity”.
The following map shows the antique Mesopotamia. The Sabirs came perhaps from the Zagros
Mountains:

5500 B.C.

The Proto-Sumerians wander from Transylvania, where the age of the clay tablets of
Tatárlaka has been testified by C14 analysis, towards Mesopotamia, where they start the
Copper Age. Since Hungary is rich in copper, the Proto-Sumerian metallurgists may
have brought their technical knowledge from their homeland into Mesopotamia. These
Proto-Sumerians may be considered already as Hungarians, since their writing, that is
identical with early Sumerian pictographic writing found in the cultures of Uruk-Warka
IV- (ca. 3500-3200 v. Chr.) and Jemdet-Nasr (ca. 3100-2900 v. Chr.), corresponds to the
Székely runes (Hung. rovásírás, literally “carve-writing”, from Hung. róni “to carve” and

3000 B.C.

“Sumerian colonies are established from the Atlantic Ocean through the Mediterranean
and Danubian basins to India and Central Asia (Turan), and from the Caucasus to
Northeast Africa. The vast belt of Eurasian grasslands stretching from the Carpathian
mountains to the Altai range, bordered in the North by the Eurasian forest belt and in
the South by the Caucasus and Iranian plateau, is gradually settled by Sumerians and
Sumerian-related people from Mesopotamia, Transcaucasia and Iran. These Near
Eastern settlers became the peoples which were later referred to as the Scythians, Huns,
Avars and Magyars among others”. The Carpathian basin was reached by the Scythians
in the 6th century B.C., the Huns in the 5th century A.D., the Avars in the 6th century
A.D. and by the Magyars in the 9th century B.C.
“First appearance of nomadic Semitic tribes in Sumerian Mesopotamia. Semitic people
begin to settle in increasing numbers in Mesopotamia. The Sumerian civilization exerts
a dominant influence upon the development of later Semitic cultures”.

Iran. The Turanian Parthians, custodians of the ancient Sumerian civilization, resist the
Eastern expansion of the Roman Empire. In 226 A.D., the Persian Sassanids overthrow
the Parthian Empire which experiences a revival between 272 and 326 A.D.


2nd c. A.D.

“The Hun empire reaches its greatest extent from the Pacific to the Aral sea, from
Siberia to the Partian Empire and China. The Huns face centuries of struggle against an
increasingly offensive and encroaching Chinese imperialism and expanionism. Facing
mounting pressures from China in the East, the Huns begin the expand into Europe. In
the 4th century A.D., the Huns begin their Western military campaigns, In 375 A.D.,
the Huns defeat the Goths, setting in motion the great migration of Germanic tribes
which also contributed to the collapse of the Roman Empire”.


5th c.

“The Huns continue their crushing military campaigns against the Roman Empire. The
Huns expel the Romans from the Carpathian basin (Pannonia and Dacia were occupied
by the Romans after they had perpetrated genocidal warfare against the indigenous
inhabitants of these Carpathian regions) and the Hun empire establishes its center of
power in the Carpathian-Danubian region. Following Atilla’s death under suspicious
circumstances in 453, the Hun’s Germanic allies turn against them and the bulk of the
Hunnic tribes regroups to the East of the Carpathians, leaving a rear-guard tribe in the
Eastern Carpathians. This Hunnic tribe still inhabits this region today and they are the
Hungarian Székely people”.


562

“The Avar-Huns establish their empire in Central and Eastern Europe, with the
Carpathian basin as the center of power. The Avars continue their centuries-long
struggle against the encroaching German and Byzantine empires”.

2. Introduction into Sumarian-Hungarian research


9th c.

“Following the settlements of Jewish refugees from the Near East in the Khazar
empire, the ruling dynasty of the Khazars, another Turanian people, is converted to
Judaism and seeks to impose this religion upon all its subjects. This precipitates a civil
war which leads to the collapse of the Khazar empire. Several rebel Khazar tribes join
the Hungarian federation which was led by the Magyar tribe. At that time the
Hungarians were established in their own independent state of Dentumagyaria, between
the Avar and Khazar empires”.


859-96

“After the collapse of the Khazar Empire, the Magyars and the other Hungarian tribes
move West into the Etelköz region, where the Covenant of Blood takes place. This
Covenant effectively creates the Magyar (Hungarian) nation which proceeds with the
reconquest of the Carpathian basin and its surrounding regions. After expelling foreign
encroaching powers from the Carpathian region and uniting with their previously
settled Hun-Avar ethnic kin, the Magyars establish the Hungarian state in 896 as the
successor state to the Hun and Avar empires”.

After around 3000 B.C., the Akkadians started to torment the Sumerians, which leaded them to
emigration, but only a part of them became the later Scythians, Huns, Avars, Parthians and Magyars. As
will be shown in this book, a relatively big part of the Sumerians wandered not to the North, but to the
South, they spread out all over Tibet, India, China, Japan, etc. and as far as to the South Sea, where they
left their traces in the languages and cultures of the Oceanian people. That part of the Sumerians,
however, who took the way North via Caucasus into the Carpathian basin must have met on its way
one ore more aboriginal peoples, who may have joined the later Hungarians before they separated and
spread out as far as to the later Finland, Estonia and Lappland: They became what is mistakenly called
today the “Finno-Ugrians”, and the small common stock of cognates (cf. chapters 3 and 4) may find its
explication by borrowing from the Sumerian-Hungarians.

3. Is there a Finno-Ugric or Uralic language family?


3. Is there a Finno-Ugric or Uralic
language family?
Even in traditional Finno-Ugric or Uralic departments, the existence of a Finno-Ugric or Uralic
language family has been doubted for a couple of years. But while more and more scholars are
convinced, that the former Uralic language family is nothing but a Sprachbund, most Finno-Ugrists
defend their position as representatives of a language family.
In this chapter, using the 100 words Swadesh-list and considering 10 Finno-Ugric and 2 Samoyed
languages, it will be shown that neither the one nor the other assumption is justified. The politically
motivated construction of a Finno-Ugric language family in the 18th century shows such a small basis of
common words that would put back Proto-Finno-Ugric or Proto-Uralic long before 10’000 B.C. and
therefore leads itself ad absurdum. On the other side, it will be shown that the theory of the Sumerian
origin of Hungarian, commonly accepted before the invention of the Finno-Ugric and Uralic language
families (cf. Érdy 1974), is acceptable also from a language-statistical point.
The 12 Uralic as well as the Sumerian and Akkadian Swadesh lists were compiled from dictionaries
(cf. the bibliography, Chapter 19). Unfortunately, the Ostyak dictionary of Karjalainen (1948) and the
Mordwin dictionary of Paasonen (1990-96) were not available to me, because the Library of Congress
does not borrow reference works. From the living languages only the Finnic and Estonian lists could be
controlled by native speakers in the spring of 2003 in the Institute of Uralistics of the University of
Szombathely (Hungary). The Hungarian list was compiled by the present author according to his native
speaker’s proficiency.
Since, as it is known, the Swadesh list was and is still discussed controversely, I would like to mention
here only a few recent cases, in which the list could be applied successfully, i.e. where the calculations
that follow from the list are matching with the chronological data of non-statistical linguistics: Elbert
(1953) for Polynesian languages; Rabin (1975) for Semitic languages, Blažek for Sumerian (including
Emesal), Akkadian, Elamitic, Kassitic, Hurrian, Urartian and Hattic; Forster, Tóth and Bandelt (1998)
for 17 Retoromance/Ladinic dialects and recently Forster and Tóth (2003) for Celtic languages.

3. Is there a Finno-Ugric or Uralic language family?

The evaluation of the three Swadesh lists results in the following percentages:
Hungarian = Sumerian: 91%
Hungarian = Akkadian: 27% (2%)
These indications that are on the first sight contradictory, have to been understood as follows: From
the 27 words, that Hungarian shares with Akkadian, 25% are to be considered either as Sumerian
borrowings in Akkadian or as Akkadian borrowings in Sumerian. For 2 Hungarian words there is not
(yet?) a Sumerian etymology. To say it in other words: 93% of the Swadesh list has a Mesopotamian
etymology – while, as one remembers, Proto-Uralic has only 24.54% and Proto-Finno-Ugrian-Uralic
even only 23.33% common words.
The extremely high percentage of 27% Akkadian-Semitic words in Hungarian goes along with an
observation by Ida Bobula: „I am convinced that the Hungarian language bears the stamp of not an
early, but of a very late stage of Sumerian culture. This is shown by the quantity of Semitic cultural
loanwords in Hungarian; from Akkadian and Babylonian“ (Bobula 1996, p. 51; cf. also Bobula 1951, p.

11, note 3). Gostony, too, who did not work with the Swadesh list either, but etymologized all available
Hungarian words, came to the conclusions that from the (according to his counting) 1050 words in his
Sumerian etymological dictionary 923 are shared with Hungarian words, this are 87.9% (cf. also Oláh

1980, p. 12). These results show firstly a pretty exact correspondence between two methodically fully
different approaches and secondly their independency of the Swadesh list.
Aside from that, Gostony has shown that Hungarian and Sumerian correspond in 51 of 53 grammatical
phonetical, morphological and syntactical) features (Gostony 1975, pp. 175ss., esp. 194ss.). The
correspondances between Hungarian and the „Turanian“ and „Non-Turanian“ languages are according
to Gostony (1975, pp. 201s.): Hungarian: 51; Tur languages: 29; Caucasian languages: 24, northern
Finno-Ugric languages: 21; Tibeto-Burmanic languages: 12; Munda-Khol languages: 9; Paleo-Sibirian
languages: 8; Oceanic languages: 7; Akkadian: 5; Sanskrit: 5; Dravidian languages: 5; Chinese: 5, IndoEuropean languages: 4; Bask: 4; Hamitic languages: 3; Japanese: 3.
In view of that, Charles Dombi comes to the following conclusion: “Thus, from the evidence left by
this process of colonization, it appears that the Sumerian city-states were able to exert a preponderant
economic, cultural, linguistic and ethnic influence during several thousand years not only in
Mesopotamia and the rest of the Near East, but also beyond, in the Mediterranean Basin, in the
Danubian Basin, in the regions North of the Caucasus and of the Black Sea, the Caspian-Aral, VolgaUral, and Altai regions, as well as in Iran and India. It seems therefore that the Sumerians and their
civilization had a determining influence not only on later Near-Eastern civilizations, but also on the
Mediterranean, Indian, and even Chinese civilizations, as well as on the formation of the various
Eurasian ethno-linguistic groups" (Dombi 2001, p. 7).

Generally, according to Swadesh (1955) a language keeps each 1000 Jahre 86% from its vocabulary.
Therefore we get the following table:
After 1000 years:
After 2000 years:
After 3000 years:
After 4000 years:
After 5000 years:
After 6000 years:

After 11’000 years:
etc.


34.8%

29.92%

25.73%

22.13%

19.03%,

According to the calculated percentages, Proto-Uralic should have existed therefore about 9000 years
ago. The separation of the Samoyed languages (Nganasan and Selkup) from Lapponic should have
happened even about 11’000 years ago, i.e. still 2000 years before Proto-Uralic, whose members they
are! As one can see very easily, both the hypothesis of a Finno-Ugric and of an Uralic language family
lead themselves ad absurdum.
Languages with such small common lexical stock can best be considered Sprachbünde (loose language
complexes), but never language families. Principally, also the question arises, if it is possible to
reconstruct languages at 11’000 and more years back. Concretely speaking, this would mean – since the
Uralic languages are a member of the Nostratic “language family” -, that the latter must be still several
thousands, if not ten-thousands of years older then Proto-Uralic: an assumption that very probably has
to be considered in the light of glottogony as pure nonsense.

4. Comparing Hungarian etymologies from standard etymological dictionaries


4. Comparing Hungarian etymologies
from standard etymological dictionaries
We compare the etymologies of the 100 words in the basic Swadesh-List, as given in the following four
standard Hungarian etymological dictionaries, whose abbreviations we use in the list that follows:
Bárczi = Bárczi, Géza: Magyar szófeitő szótár. Budapest 1941
Benkő 1 = Benkő, Loránd (ed.), A magyar nyelv történeti-etimológiai szótára. Budapest 1967ff.
Lakó = Lakó György (ed.), A magyar szókészlet finnugor elemei. 3 vols. Budapest 1967ff.
Benkő 2 = Benkő, Loránd (ed.), Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Ungarischen. 3 vols. Budapest

1992ff.
Further abbreviations: UR = Uralic origin, FU = Finno-Ugric origin, U = Ugric origin, Tu = borrowing
from a Tur language (including Turkish), Sl = borrowing from a Slawic language, — = unknown or
uncertain origin. == (only in Lakó) means, that the word in question is not present in all (or in none of)
the UR or FU languages.
As usual, derivations do not count, i.e. only the etymology of the stem of a word is considered (ex. g.
farok, férfi, személy, etc.).

The same Bárczi, according to whom only 61% of the basic vocabulary of Hungarian is shown here to
be FU and U, asserted in his book “A magyar nyelv életraja” (Budapest, 3rd ed. 1975) that the share of
FU or U words, respectively, is “not under 75%”.
Considering that UR was before the 4th millennium BC, FU about the 3rd mill. BC and U around the

1st mill. BC (cf. István Fodor, Verecke híres útján, Budapest 1975), between 13% and 15% of the
Hungarian basic vocabulary ranges in a time space of not less than 3000 years (these are the “doubtful”
words, that have been marked in the list by the question mark).
Despite (or because?) of increasing research in Samoyedic linguistis, the percentage of
uncertain/unknwon etymologies grew from 21% to 28%.
If one follows the very strict rules imposed to historical language comparison by Gerhard Doerfer in
his article “Bemerkungen zur linguistischen Klassifikation” (“Remarks to linguistic classification”, in:
Indogermanische Forschungen 76, 1971), only 8% of the Hungarian basic vocabulary have a “proven”
UR, FU, or U origin, i.e. for 92% of the basic vocabulary there is nothing such as a “proof”, that UR or
FU build a “language family” and U builds one of the nodes of this “family”. This goes together with
the results of Angela Marcantonio in her article “A case study within Uralic” (2004): “The key Ugric
node, on which the family was historically based, has never been reconstructed, and it is widely
recognized that Hungarian is radically different in morphology, lexicon and phonology from its
supposed siblings in the Ugric node”.
In an earlier publiation “Is there a Finno-Ugric or even an Uralic language family?” (2006), I have
already demonstrated on the basis of the Hungarian basic words themselves, that there is neither an
Uralic nor a Finno-Ugric family. In this present article I have shown, that according to the etymological
- 38 -

4. Comparing Hungarian etymologies from standard etymological dictionaries

reconstruction of the Hungarian basic vocabulary by the four standard etymological dictionaries, there
isn’t either an Uralic nor a Finno-Ugric language family. Uralistics and Finno-Ugristics change their
opinion about UR, FU, U, loanwords or uncertain and unknown origin of Uralic and Finno-Ugric
works with each dictionary – without being able to show the reasons. On of these possible reasons is
for sure not better insight on the basis of further results, since – as Marcantonio correctly remarked:
“Most studies of the Uralic languages (...) do not state the sound-rules on which the correlations are
supposed to be based”. Therefore, the main result of the present study is, that Uralistics and
Finno-Ugristics are pseudo-sciences that work on the basis of kling-klang-etymologies.

5. Sumarian and Hungarian


5. Sumerian and Hungarian
Preliminary remarks: Gostony’s “Dictionnarie d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975) is ordered – as
one would await from a Sumerian dictionary – according to the Sumerian words and word-groups. Yet,
the ordering is not alphabetical, but according to special themes, i.e. semantically. (Inside of the
semantic groups the order is not alphabetical either.) Moreover, the book has no register (a general
disease of French scientific works). Furthermore, the semantic grouping of the Sumerian words results
in the fact, that one and the same Hungarian word can occur (and many really do) more than one time.
Several Sumerian words, too, appear more than once. These problems are the first reason, why I
decided to order Gostony’s dictionary alphabetically according to the Hungarian words. In doing so, we
get 1042 etymological articles, whose first line consists of the Hungarian entry, the second line of the
sources (Sumerian dictionaries, vocabularies, glossaries, etc. used by Gostony) and the third line of the
Sumerian etymon. The second reason, why I give here the full Sumerian-Hungarian list is, of course,
because none of the languages, that will be compared with this list, contains all and the same entries as
the Sumerian-Hungarian list.

6. Hungarian and the other Finno-Ugric languages


6. Hungarian and the other
Finno-Ugric languages

1. Introduction
The book “Affinitas linguae Hungaricae cum linguis fennicae originis grammatice demonstrata”, that
appeared 1799 in Göttingen, written by the Hungarian physician Sámuel Gyarmathi, is nowadays
officially regarded as the foundation of Finno-Ugristics. But a closer look at the 800 etymologies of
Gyarmathi shows that only 34 or 4% are still considered to be correct (Hanzeli 1983, p. xxvi).
Therefore, it is astonishing, that for his contemporaries Gyarmathi’s work “would provide a convincing
proof of the existence of the Finno-Ugric family of languages and of the membership of his native
language, Hungarian, in that family, so convincing that his work was accepted with broad approval by
European scholars and that the filiation of Hungarian has never since been seriously questioned”
(Hanzeli 1983, p. xvi). Besides the fact, that there very many attemps to question the Finno-Ugric
hypothesis (cf. e.g. Érdy 1974), such an “approval” may be pardonable for pre-scientist at the beginning
of the 19th century, but it is not understandable at all, why the mistaken concept of a Finno-Ugric
familiy is still widely accepted today. Gyarmathi’s predecessor, whom he followed in the etymological
part of his work, the Jesuit János Sajnovics, compared already in 1770 150 pairs of Hungarian and
Lapponic words. Sebeok, in his foreword to the reprint of Sajnovics’s work, says that the author was
“providing far-reaching and firm evidence for this hypothesis” (1968, p. 3) – in reality, there is none at
all, since almost all of Sajnovics etymologies are today considered to be mistaken.
Nevertheless, both Sajnovics and Gyarmathi successfully banned the “Orientlistic” theory about the
origin of Hungarian as inaugurated by Ferenc Otrokócsi Foris (1693) to the background. The reasons
are clear for everybody who is acquainted with European history: After the end of the Turkish rule over
Hungary (1526-1606), the Habsburgs influenced Hungary stronger and stronger, and from 1867 to

1918, Hungary was even as a kingdom a part of the Habsburgian empire. From this political fact, it
follows, that it was not by chance, that the Indo-European comparative historical grammar was applied
to Hungarian and his alleged relatives – since German, the official language of Austria, was already
proven to be a member of the IE family. And neither is it by chance, that Hungarian was first
compared with Lapponic, i.e. with the most distant of all alleged relatives of Hungarian, since in the

19th century, the Lapps still lived like people in the Stone Age. In other words: It was “proven” by
Sajnovics, Gyarmathi and their successors, that the siblings of the Hungarians have no share with such
ancient cultures like the Sumerians, the Akkadians and other Oriental people, to whom their origin was
traced back since the 17th century.
The following map shows the geographical distirbution of the Finno-Ugric languages incl. Hungarian:

6. Hungarian and the other Finno-Ugric languages

In the following, I compare the 1042 word articles from Gostony (1975), a work, that was published
under the auspices of the French National Science Foundation under the directionship of the worldfamous Orientalist and professor at Sorbonne University, Raymond Jestin, with the 10’714 word
articles in the “Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Ungarischen” (EWU). I abolished all FU words of the

1042 etyma of Gostony (1975) that do not have at least one other testimony in one other FU language
according to the EWU. There are many reasons, why the EWU has no other testimonies than the
Hungarian word under discussion: 1. The etymology of an etymon is unknown. 2. The EWU claims for
“onomatopoetical” origin (and thus it doesn’t supply us with an etymology). 3. The EWU claims that a
certain word is “an inner-Hungarian development” (and hence without correspondences in other FU
languages). 4. The stem of a word is considered to be “fictitious” (as a matter of fact, Hungarian is the
only language all over the world that has such alleged “fictitious” stems). 5. The first or the second part
of composed words has no correspondence in other FU languages. Moreover, in many cases, the EWU
declares an etymology as “doubtful” or “uncertain”, but sometimes anyway gives alleged
correspondences in other FU languages.
There are two other problems concerning the FU “family”: 1. In many cases (that I did not count),
Hungarian words are compared with words of distant languages, most of all Permic ones. 2. Estonian
seems hardly to be considered anymore a member of the FU “language family” – from our 1042 etyma
only 6 words have a correspondence with an Estonian word – the same is true with most of the 10’714
word articles of the EWU. 3. Very often there is only 1 correspondence in 1 other FU language, and

morphology, lexicon and phonology from its supposed siblings in the Ugric node”. It is also well
known, that many nodes in the FU family tree have more sound-laws than examples to illustrate this
sound-laws.

3. Conclusions
As a matter of fact, having compared the 10’714 word articles of the EWU with the 1042 word articles
in Gostony (1975), we got not more than 286 Hungarian-Sumerian-FU etymologies. This means: Only

27% of the common Sumerian-Hungarian words are shared by other FU languages – to little a number
to speak about a genetical relationship, that would be required for a language family. In another paper
(Toth 2006), I have compared the 100 words Swadesh-list with the same FU languages that I was
working here, and the result was, that 31.9% of Hungarian words are shared with the other FU
languages – the percentages are thus pretty close to one another. Hungarian is, therefore, not genetically
related to the FU languages, although some of them may have been more of less strongly influenced by
Hungarian. Probabaly, the FU languages – amongst them I understand from now on all FU languages
without Hungarian – were spoken by an Urbevölkerung, whom the Hungarians met during their
wandering from the shores of the Black Sea headed for the Carpathian Basin. They may have either
stayed a while together with members of this Urbevölkerung or a few of them may have joined the
Hungarians. The last assumption would also explain, why they are f.ex. Permic and other FU loanwords
in Hungarian and why in many cases Vog. and Osty. do not share Hungarian words, but e.g. Finn.
and/or Lapp. do.

7. Caucasian and Hungarian

1. Introduction
The Caucasus Mountains have ever played a big role in the discussions about the origin of the
Hungarians (cf. the standard work Bendefy 1941/2002). This may also have to do with the fact, that the
Caucasian languages – divided in many groups and subgroups each of them containing several
languages that differ a lot from one another and that are extraordinarily complex - have a very long
time never been researched thoroughly. Even today, there are many data lacking. Linguists like Karl
Bouda and Johannes Hubschmid tried to assemble the little available data mainly from Russian and
Armenian vocabularies, glossaries and directly from the few available texts. The first languages to be
described were the South Caucasian languages (Georgian, Mingrelian, Laz, etc.), that served as a basis
for Michael von Tseretheli’s studies “Sumerian and Georgian” that appeared between 1913 and 1916
and that serve also as a basis for our present study.
The map underneath shows the Caucasian languages in a broader context:

3. Conclusions
From the 260 etyma given by Tseretheli (1916), only 78 or 30% are shared by Gostony’s etymological
dictionary (1975). The one reason for that we have already mentioned: The more or less catastrophic
situation of Caucasian language data at the beginning of the 20th century. The other reason is that
Tseretheli had to work with the very earliest Sumerian sources (cf. Tseretheli 1913, pp. 785ss.), i.e. he
did not even have the first reliable Sumerian dictionary of Friedrich Delitzsch, that appeared in 1914,
not to speak about Father Deimel’s “Šumerisches Lexikon” (Rome 1928ss.) and later works. So,
Tseretheli’s both fundaments – the Sumerian as well as the Georgian – were fragmentary and
provisional. Therefore, it does not astonish either, that his 78 remaining Sumerian-Hungarian-Georgian
etymologies make only 7% of Gostony’s word list. But nevertheless, one does not get the impression,
that Caucasian and Hungarian are closely related as the older history works wanted to teach us. In the
opposite: Despite the bad sources, with which Tseretheli had to work, it seems strongly, that the
Caucasian mountains were only a marching-through-area of the Sumerians on their long trip from
Mesopotamia into the Carpathian basin.

8. Bantu and Hungarian

1. Introduction
The Reverend W. Wanger, author of many publications and scientific grammars of the Ntu (Bantu)
languages, esp. Zulu, wrote in the introduction of his book “Comparative Lexical Study of Sumerian
and Ntu (Bantu)”: “Sumerian can be shown to be ‘the Sanscrit’ for the immense Ntu family of
languages” (Wanger 1935, p. xxxvii). In other words: Since Sumerian is the oldest testified language of
the world, it can be taken as an existing basis instead of the reconstructed proto-pseudo languages
(cf. also Marácz 2006) like Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Finno-Ugric, Proto-Altaic, etc. Wanger further
mentions, that therefore there was no need for him either to reconstruct a hypothetical Proto-Bantu,
since he compares the real Sumerian with the real Bantu tongues and since in many cases esp. Ntu
conserves both the form and the meaning of words not only similarly but identical (cf. f. ex. Wanger

1935, p. 79, here no. 47). From this point of view, the often heard counter-argument against comparing
Sumerian with one of the living languages is pointless.
The following map shows a very rough distribution of African languages:

8. Bantu and Hungarian

Already Meinhof (194-15) had shown grammatical and some lexical parallels between Sumerian and
several African languages. An unsolved problem is the relationship between the Bantu languages and
other African languages, since we find Sumerian traces in both groups (cf. Czermak 1921-22; Drexel

1919-20; Hummel 1992, 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Wölfel 1955).

3. Conclusions
Wanger (1935) wrote an impressive study containing more than 330 pp., but with only 138 Sumerian
words taken from Delitzsch (1914), since the “Šumerisches Lexikon” of Father Anton Deimel was only
to appear, when Wanger wrote his book. (This is also the reason, why only 83 of these 138 Sumerian
words are mentioned in Gostony 1975, who is based on Deimel and newer dictionaries, vocabularies
and glossaries). Nevertheless, Wanger concluded already in an earlier study, that was meant as a
prodromus for his later book: “Von Sumer fällt unstreitig viel Licht auf Afrika” (From Sumeria, there is
no doubt, much light falls on Africa” (Wanger 1929, p. 563). But in reality, only 83 words or 8% are
shared with the 1042 word articles of Gostony’s reference work “Dictionnarie d’étymologie
- 251 -

8. Bantu and Hungarian

sumérienne” (1975). The Bantu languages come therefore just before the Polynesian languages, that
share 82 words or 7% of the common Sumerian-Hungarian cognates from Gostony’s dictionary.
How did the Sumerians come to Africa? Wanger’s indications are in this point underdetermined: “The
only possible conclusion, I believe, is that the mother-tongue from which both the Sumerians and the
forefathers of the Ntus drew their fundamental idea of grammar as well as the greater part of their
vocabulary common to both, belongs to prehistoric times. This would also explain why the Zulus like
all Ntus have no kind of writing, whilst them Sumerians had” (Wanger 1935, p. vii). However, this
cannot be true, since the Sumerians came from Transylvania (Erdély, Siebenbürgen) (cf. von Torma

1894; Vlassa 1963; Badiny 2001) according to the testimony of the Tatárlaka writing, that is about 2000
years older than the first picture-cuneiform writing in Mesopotamia. So, if the Bantus had a common
origins with the Sumerians, they also would have a writing. So the lacking script is a very strong
argument against a common origin of both people. The only explication of the little SumerianHungarian traces in Bantu is through emigration out of Mesopotamia. But only very few Sumerians
could have come to Africa, since otherwise they would of course have thought their writing to the
indigenous people, that must have been already there. Moreover, since many Bantu (yet less Zulu)
words conserve form and meaning of Sumerian words, the emigration must have been in a very early
time: As early as from the 26th century B.C. on, the Akkadians started to torment the Sumerians.

9. Etruscan and Hungarian


9. Etruscan and Hungarian
Already in 1874, the British priest Isaac Taylor brought up the idea of a genetic relationship between
Etruscan and Hungarian (Taylor 1874). Since the very influential linguist August Friedrich Pott
accepted this relationship in the first number of his journal “Internationale Zeitschrift für Allgemeine
Sprachwissenschaft” (the first journal of General Linguistics), this relationship was internationally
accepted (Pott 1877, pp. 15ss.). In 1917, the German linguist Georg Sigwart showed the relationship
between Etruscan and Sumerian (Sigwart 1917, esp. pp. 148ss.), by which the relationship between
Sumerian, Etruscan and Hungarian was established. On the XIX. International Congress of Orientalists
in Rome, 1935, Félix von Pográny-Nagy gave a widespread lecture about his own new researches in the
area of Etruscan, Hungarian and Sumerian (von Pográny-Nagy 1938, pp. 77-81), that was only an
excerpt of a much bigger work (von Pográny-Nagy 1936-36), that was unfortunately never published.
Several Sumerian-Etruscan-Hungarian etymologies came from the famous historian Viktor Padányi in
various studies (e.g. Padány 1963, esp. pp. 435ss., and 1964).
Under the huge pressure of the Finno-Ugric scholars, that would not accept the Sumerian-Hungarian
theory, the Etruscan-Hungarian hypothesis, too, lost its importance in the last decades, because its
adherents were blacklisted and banished from the leading FU journals. However, recently the situation
changed mainly because of two reasons: 1. Since Hungary was liberated in 1990 from the communist
leaders, the publication of non-FU research is again allowed in Hungary. 2. The Internet has been used
worldwide as a medium of distribution of all these banned articles of the independent scholars.
Meanwhile, also well-installed university professors are to be found amongst the “mavericks” of FU
linguistics and therefore, the situation has turned around: The supposedly stable seats of the traditional
FU linguists begin to shake, and never before – not even during what was called in linguistics the
“Second Hungarian-Turkish war” – the FU linguists in and outside of Hungary had to defend
themselves with such aggression (cf. Marácz 2006a, 2006b, 2006c).
The present status of research of Etruscan can be characterized like that: Certain scholars 1. accept,
that Etruscan is non-Indo-European, but claim that it is a linguistic isolate (the majority of linguists,
leaded by Pfiffig and Pallottino); 2. accept, that Etruscan is non-IE, related to Hungarian, but not to
Sumerian (this is nothing else but a form of denial of the Hungarian-Sumerian theory, most prominent
representative is Alinei); 3. accept, that Etruscan is non-IE and related to both Hungarian and Sumerian
(the already mentioned authors, in newer time also Zászlós-Zsóka 2001 and many others); 4. claim that
Etruscan is IE (basically Italic, Greek, Hittite) (Georgiev, Steinbauer, Bomhard). As category 5. one
could still mention very few scholars (mostly non-linguistics), who want to connect Etruscan with any
other language, e.g. Caucasian.
Etruscan is a corpus-language, i.e. we know only of a very limited number of words and grammatical
structures. Most of the known words belong to similar semantic fields, since the Etruscan inscriptions
are mostly dedications to gods or stand on gravestones. Furthermore, the meanings of many words are
controversial. In our list, we give the meanings according to Majláth (2005), in the case of discrepancies
also according to Alinei (2003). For the sound-laws concerning Etruscan and Hungarian cf. Alinei
(2003, pp. 281-318), for the sound-laws concerning Sumerian and Hungarian cf. Gostony’s
“Dictionnaire d’étymologie sumérienne” (Paris 1975).

9. Etruscan and Hungarian

The following map shows the Etruscan territory in the 6th century B.C.:

The Etruscan-Hungarian word list, that I will present now, contains 280 etymologies, around 33% of
which have Sumerian etymologies. This percentage is higher than the percentages between Hungarian
and the FU languages (27 % resp. 31%, cf. Tóth 2006a, 2006b), even unlike Etruscan, the FU languages
are not corpus languages.

The simple fact, that it is possible to establish 280 pairs of Etruscan and Hungarian words that are
related via sound-laws, proves, that Etruscan and Hungarian are really genetically related to one
another. Considering the fact, that our knowledge of Etruscan is very limited, the further fact, that 33%
of these 280 Etruscan-Hungarian etymologies have Sumerian cognates – again proven by sound-laws -,
shows, that Etruscan is an even better-than-average member of the FU language family. Comparing the
oldest known Hungarian texts, the Halotti Beszéd and the O-Mária siralom (12th/13th centuries) with
the Etruscan-Hungarian inscriptions, one must conclude, that the Etruscans cannot have been
Hungarians who emigrated from the Carpathian basin to Tuscany and related areas, where they show
up since about 800 B.C. Also the fact, that we have clear traces of Lydian influence in Etruscan (lacking
in Hungarian) leads to the assumption that Etruscans and Hungarians must have separated from one
another already in Mesopotamia. Probably, the time under discussion is the Seevölkersturm time (sea
people movements), i.e. the 13th and 12th centuries B.C. The later Etruscans must therefore have spent
around 400-500 years in the Greek archipelago, what also explains the Greek loanwords in Etruscan.

10. Tibeto-Burman and Hungarian

1. Introduction
Kőrösi Csoma Sándor, or, as he is called outside of Hungary, Alexander Csoma de Körös, was born at
the end of March 1784 in Kőrös, a small village in the county of Háromszék in south-eastern
Transylvania (Erdély). After having studied philology in Nagyenyed (Hungary) and in Göttingen
(Germany), he started his life-long trip on foot in order to discover the homeland of the Hungarian
people. He spent eight years in the monasteries of the Himalayan provinces and worked through the
whole Kanjur and Tanjur, 320 large printed volumes, that contain the classical Tibetan literature, in
order to write the first Tibetan-English and Tibetan-Sanskrit-English dictionaries, the first Tibetan
grammar in English and a long series of articles dealing with Tibetan literature. The commentaries to
the Tibetan texts, that he read together with two lamas came to be known as the “Alexander books”,
written in the form of a dialogue in which Csoma asks basic questions and the lamas do their best to
answer. The “Alexander books” immortalized Csoma in Tibetan literature. Csoma’s work “can be
considered the last great feat of European discovery” (Fox, p. 61).
But the founding of Tibetology was not the primary intent of Csoma. He wanted to prove, that the
original homeland of the Hungarians laid in the north of Tibet. He wrote: “Since I acquired the
absolute conviction that if God keeps me alive I can carry out and prove within a short period of time
what the supporters and friends of our national language and literature have desired for so long ...
about the original homeland of our nation” (ap. Fox, p. 37). Csoma believed, that the most ancient
homeland of the Hungarian ancestors lies in Great and Little Bokharia, two vast, geographically
separated areas now defined as being in the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan, and Yarkand in the
Tarim basin, which is north of the Tibetan plateau and is now within the Chinese territory of Xinjiang.
In studying the language and literature of Tibet he hoped to find references in the Tibetan texts that
would prove his case about the origin of the Hungarians. In the foreword to his Tibetan-English
dictionary, Csoma wrote about himself: “To his own nation he feels a pride in announcing, that the
study of the Sanscrit will be more satisfactory, than to any other people in Europe. The Hungarians will
find a fund of information from its study, respecting their origin, manners, customs, and language;
since the structure of the Sanscrit (as also of other Indian dialects) is most analogous to the Hungarian,
while it greatly differs from that of the languages of occidental Europe” (Kőrösi Csoma 1834, p. xlvixlvii).
On his last attempt to reach Yarkand, the supposed homeland of the Magyars, how Hungarians call
themselves, he died on malaria near Darjeeling, shortly after beginning the most ambitious journey of
his life, an attempt to enter the Tibetan capital, Lhasa, and travel over the Himalayan plateau to the
desert plain of western China, where he hoped to find the ancestors of the Hungarian people. But his
travel ended only after a few days. Dr. Archibald Campbell, the physician and superintendent of the
station at Darjeeling, wrote: “It is with much regret that I report the death at this place, on the 11th
instant (April 1842), of Csoma de Kőrös, the Hungarian traveler and Tibetan scholar. He fell victim to
a fever, contracted on his journey hitherto, for the cure of which he would not be persuaded to take
any medicines until it was too late to be of any avail” (ap. Fox, p. 92) He was buried the next day in the
- 296 -

British station’s burial-ground. His grave at the foot of the Himalaya is conserved and a highlight of
Hungarian pilgrimage.
In 1933, nearly a century after his death, the Tokyo Buddhist University in Japan declared Alexander
Csoma de Kőros a Bodhisattva, en enlightened being who postpones his entry into nirvana in order to
help others on their path to enlightenment. A shrine was dedicated to him, with a bronze statue of
Csoma sitting in the lotus position. In the same spirit, the main Buddhist institution in Hungary is
named after him, the Alexander Csoma de Körös International Institute of Buddhology, and there are
all over the world Kőrösi Csoma Sándor foundations, who support the research of the Hungarian
homeland. “And we in India, the Asiatic Society in Calcutta especially, can claim him, as Hungary does,
as one of India’s heroes also” (Mukerjee, p. viii). “To think of Csoma de Kőros is to think thus, in
Indian terms, of the Tapasvin, the lonely seer, ‘not a glowing coal but a shining lamp; he is not only
consumed, he illumines’” (Mukerjee, p. 6).
But the fact, that Csoma never reached Yarkand, leaded certain of his biographers to strange and false
conclusions. I will cite here two passages of Fox’ biography “The Hungarian who walked to Heaven”,
one of the most widespread English works about Csoma: “He never made it to Yarkand, the imagined
seat of his ancestors. If he had, he would certainly have been disappointed. There is nothing at
Yarkand. It is a small caravan town in the desert (...). Scientific rationality wasn’t the point. Csoma’s
theory wasn’t really a theory at all. It was a personal myth, a private heaven (...). In Csoma’s myth of
Yarkand, he played the part of the redeemer, guiding his oppressed people back to the haven of their
original homeland, an idealized Buddhist Hungary situated in the remotest spot on earth, beyond the
planet’s highest mountains” (Fox, p. 94).
“Csoma was, as all who met him agreed, a very strange man. A contemporary psychiatrist might have
diagnosed him with a variant of narcissistic personality disorder” (Fox, p. 95.) After, the author quotes
a passage of the “American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fourth edition”.
Against these insults speak, that:

1. Yarkand was the seat of an ancient Buddhist kingdom on the southern branch of the Silk Road.
The fertile oasis is fed by the Yarkand River which flows north down from the Kunlun Mountains
and covers now some 3,210 km2, but was likely far more extensive before the period of desiccation
began to afflict the region from the 3rd century B.C. onwards (cf. Wikipedia, s.v.).

2. In Yarkand, there are the ruins of a settlement and a mountain (1570m) with the name “MazarTag” (Times-Atlas), whose etymology is the same as that of Magyar, the self-denomination of the
Hungarians.

3. Dr. Bátor Vámos-Tóth found 24 place-, river-, sea- and mountain-names in Tibet, that are
phonetically identical with corresponding names in the Carpathian Basin (cf. in the Internet s.v.
“Tamana”).

4. The famous French orientalist Jacques Bacot, wrote in his book, “Le tibet révolté, vers Népémakö,
la terre promise des Tibétains” (English translation by A.T.): “I will learn there, looking at
abandoned villages, about the existence of Népémakö, the Promised Land of the Tibetans, to
which the defeated people emigrated. Where exactly is Népémakö situated? Behind the Tsarong,
people say, between the Poyul and the Himalaya. The Tibetans have discovered it eight years
before. At that time, it was still uninhabited. This is a very hot country ‘as hot as is India’, covered
with flowers and so fertile, that one has not to work, but only to pick the fruits of the earth. Before
its discovering, the lamas knew its existence from the books, since in the 8th century, the Hindu
missionary Padma Sambhava visited it (Bacot, p. 10). The etymology of Népémakö is Hung. nép
“people” and Makó (Hungarian place name, cf. Kiss II, p. 83). The –ö instead of the –ó shows, that
this place name comes from a time, where vowel harmony was not yet finished.

5. And last but by no means least, there is an enormous amount of archaeological evidence. I will cite
here directly from the report, published on February 6th 1995 by an American journalist in the
“Washington Post”: “The latest research began in 1986, when, after a break of 79 years, the
Chinese government allowed Hungarian researchers back to a graveyard about 30 miles east of
Urumchi, the capital of Xinjiang Province in the northwest corner of China. The cemetery was
discovered in 1907 by the Hungarian explorer Aurél Stein. Hungarian researchers have excavated

1,200 graves and have found archaeological objects similar to those found in Hungarian cemeteries
dating from the 9th and 10th centuries. Weapons placed in the graves are similar, and the methods of
burial and the writing systems are the same. ‘In these parts are hidden secrets never before seen’,
said István Kiszely, a prominent Hungarian ethnographer. Near the grave site, Kiszely and other
researchers happened upon a small ethnic group called Ugars by the Chinese – a group distinct
from the more populous Uyghurs, a Turkic people that dominates Xinjiang. The scientists
discovered that among them, the Ugars, who only number 9,000, knew 73 songs that fix exactly
into the pentatonic, or five toned, musical scale that has made Hungarian folk music, popularized
by composer Béla Bartók, famous worldwide. ‘We found the last lady who is singing their folk
music, and she sings it just like we Hungarians’, Kiszely said” (Pomfret, p. 2). The Ugars share their
name with the Hungarians (in German: Ungarn), whose language officially belongs to the Ugric
group of the Finno-Ugric family. Professor István Kiszely, who taught also in the United States,
summarized his findings and conclusions in his monumental two volumes work, that appeared in

2000.
The following map shows Kőrösi Csoma Sándor’s long way from Transylvania to Darjeeling:

2. Sumerian-Tibetan-Hungarian etymologies

After the first work about the genetic relationship between Tibetan and Sumerian appeared (Bodua

1938), decades had to pass, until in 2001 and 2004, respectively, the two small but extremely important
volumes “Sumerian and Tibeto-Burman” appeared, written by the internationally recognized orientalist
Jan Braun of the University of Warsaw. In his works, the author brings about 341 Sumerian-Tibetan
word equations and gives also detailed phonetic correspondences. Since Braun as well as Gostony
(1975) used the same basic work for their etymologies, Anton Deimels monumental “Šumerisches
Lexikon” (Rome 1927ss.), it was for this chapter possible to compare Hungarian and Tibetan words
directly via their common Sumerian roots on relatively modern standard. Therefore, the 232 common
Sumerian-Tibetan-Hungarian etymologies, that I will present here, are free from being biased by
“nationalistic” interests or allegedly “mistaken” etymologies of one of the authors, since Gostony died
long before Braun’s works appeared, and Braun did not use and obviously not even know Gostony’s
dictionary.

3. Conclusions
After the Hungarian archaeologist Zsófia von Torma leaded excavations in the Transylvanian Maros
area already in 1876 (Torma 1894), in 1961, the Rumanian archaeologist Nicolae Vlassa found the socalled Tartaria Tablets which show a script, that is partially pictographic and partially runic. With aid of
C14-method, the Tablets have been dated to 5000-5500 B.C. (Badiny, p. 186) and are therefore about

2000 years older than the oldest Sumerian inscriptions (Glassner, p. 49). Since the Sumerian cuneiform
originated in a pictographic script (Meissner and Oberhuber, p. 18), many researchers believe, that this
pictographic script had been brought to Mesopotamia from the carriers of the Jemdet-Nasr-Culture
(about 3100-2900 B.C.) out of Transylvania (Vlassa 1963).
For Jan Braun, the correspondences between Sumerian and Tibetan prove astonishingly, that the
Sumerians originated in Tibet: “Five and a half thousand years ago, Sumerian brook off from the
Tibeto-Burman trunk and migrated far west to southern Mesopotamia” (2001, p. 91).
Yet, from the undeniable C14 dating, it is clear, that 5500 years ago and thus at the time of the UrukWarka IV-Culture (approx. 3500-3200 v. Chr.), the carriers of Sumerian writing and language were on
their way from Transylvania, in an area not too far away, where Kőrösi Csoma Sándor was born in

1784, and Mesopotamia. But since the correspondences between Hungarian and Tibetan are
overwhelming – approximately 70% of Braun’s etymologies -, they are in fact genetically related. The
only possible conclusion, therefore, is, that the Sumerians migrated to Tibet from Mesopotamia and
not opposite. Since Akkadian influence on Sumerian can be attested already since the 26th century B.C.
(cf. Lieberman 1977), this is the terminus post quem for a migration of Sumerians up to the Yarkand
plateau and further. A probable guess of the time of this migration may be the great movement of the
sea people, i.e. in the 13th century B.C.
So, Kőrösi Csoma Sándor was right and not right at the same time. He was right with his idea to find
some of the ancestors of the Hungarians in Tibet (as Friar Julianus found some in Bashkiria in the 13th
century). Had he made it up to the Tarim Basin, he would have found even the Ugors and recognized,
what only Kiszely recognized almost 150 years later, namely that the Tarim Basin was not only a former
homeland of the Hungarians, but that still archaic Hungarians are living there. Because Csoma did not
exspect that, he was even more right, than he thought. But his was not right with his assumption, that
the Tarim Basin was the original homeland of the Hungarians. The original homeland was
Mesopotamia, but Csoma could not know that, since in his life time the Sumerian inscriptions were not
yet detected and thus the Sumerian language unknown. To come to an end, one word about Csoma’s
assumption, that Sanscrit is related with Hungarian. Csoma must have heard about the beginnings of
Indo-European studies made by Bopp, so it must have been clear to him, that Sanscrit and Hungarian
cannot be related really. But it was also Csoma who detected, that the biggest part of the Tibetan
literature are nothing but translations from Sanscrit. So, since Csoma believed, that the Tibetans are the
ancestors of the Hungarians, he must have come to the conclusion, that the real origin of Hungarian
lies in Sanscrit.

11. Munda languages and Hungarian


11. Munda languages and Hungarian

1. Introduction
The Munda Languages are a language family spoken by about 9 million people in eastern India and
Bangladesh. Since the pioneering work of Father Schmidt (1906), who took them together with the
Mon-Khmer languages, that are morphologically completely different, they still constitute a branch of
the so-called Austroasiatic language family, but nowadays placed in opposition to the Mon-Khmer
languages of Southeast Asia. According to the linguistic community, the origins of the Munda
languages are unknown, though it is generally thought that they are autochthonous languages of eastern
India.
The bipartite Diffloth (1974) classification is widely cited:
•

•

North Munda
• Korku
• Kherwarian
• Kherwari branch: Agariya, Bijori, Koraku
• Mundari branch: Mundari, Bhumij, Asuri, Koda, Ho, Birhor
• Santali branch: Santali, Mahali, Turi
South Munda
• Kharia-Juang: Kharia, Juang
• Koraput Munda
• Remo branch: Gata (Gta), Bondo (Remo), Bodo Gadaba (Gutob)
• Savara branch: Parenga (Gorum), Sora (Savara), Juray, Lodhi

The following map shows the greater area in which the Munda languages are spoken:

11. Munda languages and Hungarian

Already in 1928, the Hungarian engineer Hevesy Vilmos (Wilhelm von Hevesy, Guillaume de Hevesy)
doubted the classification of Father Schmidt and denied the existence of an Austroasiatic language
family. Von Hevesy published first using the pseudonym “F.A. Uxbond” a book under the title
“Munda-Magyar-Maori”, from which he dissociated himself later. Yet in 1932, he published another
book under the title “Finnisch-Ugrisches aus Indien”, in which he tried to prove that “into northern
India there might have been migrated a people in pre-Aryan time, that spoke a Finno-Ugrian language”
(1932, p. 1). Although von Hevesy compared in his 1932 book all Finno-Ugrian languages with
basically the Kherwarian branch of Munda – especially with Santali and Mundari, since there were no
other dictionaries at hand in his time -, he strongly focussed in his conclusions that the basic stock of
these Finno-Ugrian people were the Hungarians: “That the Magyars might have passed the Caucasus
mountains on the way to their new homeland, is very probable, since the route from India led to the
shore of the Asowian Sea, where the Magyars are historically remarked first” (1932, p. 337).
In a series of articles, that appeared between 1930 and 1936, von Hevesy tried to convince further the
linguistic community about his proof, that the Munda languages form an own branch of the FinnoUgrian language family (von Hevesy 1930-32; 1934; 1935a; 1935b; 1936a; 1936b). His theories were
refused by most linguists, but there were also a few who agreed to him. George Dobo wrote: “There
can be little said against the crushing bulk of Mr. de Hevesy’s linguistic demonstration. Should some of
them prove daring, nay, erroneous, the great mass of his material cannot be upset. Many who shook
their heads suspiciously at the early and daring works of Professor Sapir on Paiute and Southern
Nahuatl had to admit later that the ‘flair’ of a man of genius is able to see beyond a few technically
incomplete demonstrations” (1933, p. 552). Another famous linguist who believed in von Hevesy’s
theory was F. Otto Schrader. He wrote: “That von Hevesy has really proven his hypothesis, we just
have to accept” (1935, col. 637). But most known von Hevesy got as the decipherer of the Easter
Island Script: His deciphering was generally accepted by Robert von Heine-Geldern. Although Thomas
Sebeok remarked only in a footnote “Similarly Hevesy’s Munda-Finno-Ugrian hypothesis is irrelevant”
(1942, p. 212, note 26), he did not bother three years later to consecrate a whole article to this alleged
“irrelevant hypothesis” (Sebeok 1945). The sad lowpoint was finally reached in the discussion after a
lecture of von Hevesy in occasion of the “III Congresso Internazionale dei Linguisti” (Rome,
September 19-26 1933): “E(rnst) Lewy underlines, that the author (von Hevesy, A.T.) of these
- 337 -

11. Munda languages and Hungarian

extensive lectures is not a specialist in the narrowest sense, but an amateur of linguistics, to whom the
specialists in linguistics are indebted for his suggestions (...). We (Ernst Lewy, A.T.) will, as soon as we
can, follow the suggestions of H. seriously and without prejudice (...). Needless to say, that this never
happened. But not enough with that: It was – despite all efforts – impossible for me to find out even
the lifetime and some basic biograpahical facts about Wilhelm von Hevesy. He is not even listed in the
monumental “Magyar Életrajzi Lexikon” (Hungarian Biographical Lexicon).
Therefore, about 70 years later, I prove herewith, that von Hevesy was right. Von Hevesy did not have
the change to prove his theory using as a base the Sumerian language, since Father Deimel’s
“Šumerisches Lexikon” had just started to appear in the late twenties.
From the 1042 word equations, that Gostony gives, I present in the following 340 SumerianHungarian-Munda word equations out of the stock of 1134 that von Hevesy presented. This proves,
that about 30% of von Hevesy’s Hungarian-Munda equations have a Sumerian basis and that about

33% of the Sumerian-Hungarian equations are shared by the Munda languages. I purposely did not use
any other dictionaries than von Hevesy’s 1932 book in order not to contaminate his data. The
percentages, however, are sufficient enough to prove in accordance with von Hevesy, that the Munda
languages do form an own branch of Finno-Ugrian and that Hungarian is thus related with the Munda
languages.

3. Conclusions
About a third part of the Munda etymologies as presented by von Hevesy are shared both with
Sumerian and with Hungarian. Pure change is thus excluded. As already suggested by von Hevesy, the
ancestors of the Munda speakers must have come from somewhere to the area in which they live now
since thousands of years. The fact, that the percentages between Hungarian-Sumerian etymologies and
Hungarian-Sumerian-Munda etymologies are almost identical is a strong hint for the assumption, that
these ancestors came from Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia had, as it is well known, very intense
commercial relations with India already thousands of years B.C. I can, however, not agree with von
Hevesy’s hypothesis, that a part of Munda speakers left India in order to travel to the Asowian Sea and
further into the Carpathian basin. Considering the fact, that Sumerian was the ancestor language of
Hungarian, it would make no sense at all, if we would assume, that the Sumerians first emigrated to
India and then made their way back in order to travel in the diametrical direction. Having shown that
the Munda languages form an own branch of Finno-Ugrian and that the strongest component of
Munda is Hungarian, is a merit for which we have to be deeply thankful to Wilhelm von Hevesy.

12. Dravidian languages and Hungarian

1. Introduction
After the pioneering works of Schrader (1935-37), Burrow (1943-46) and Bouda (1953), in 1968,
Stephen A. Tyler presented “positive evidence for a genetic relation between Dravidian and Uralian.
The major evidence consists of systematic phonemic correspondences between 153 Proto-Dravidian
and Proto-Uralian lexial items” (1968, p. 798). Therefore, also Hungarian must be related to Dravidian.
The Dravida language are grouped as follows:

As abbreviations we use the first two letters unless this leads to confusion. Only the main languages
Tamil (Tam.), Malayalam (Mal.), Telugu (Tel.) and Kannada (Kann.) are abbreviated with more than
two letters. The following map shows the geographical distribution of the Dravida languages today:

The material, that I present in the following, comes from the very thorough studies of Zoltán Szabó
(Szabó 1982, 1983), and is compared to the 1042 word-articles from Gostony (1975). Comparing the
three languages, Sumerian, Hungarian and Dravidian, we get 377 common etymologies; the Dravidian
languages share therefore 36% of the Sumerian-Hungarian cognates.

3. Conclusions
Szabó drew the following conclusion: “This study intends to bring Magyar (Hungarian) and Dravidian
out of their ill-assumed isolation. It is the testimony of their languages that they formed a cultural entity
prior to the invasions of the peoples of the North” (Szabó 1982, p. 832). Hence, he does not say, if the
Hungarians originated in the South of India or emigrated to there from Mesopotamia. The latter seems
to assume Fane: “In summary, there was a migration of pastoralists into India – from the same general
area, and in the same general period – as that in which the earliest inhabitants of Mesopotamia entered
the Fertile Crescent” (Fane 1980, p. 296). Since it is proven, that the Sumerians came from Transylvania
(Erdély, Siebenbürgen) (von Torma 1894; Vlassa 1963; Badiny 2001) according to the testimony of the
Tatárlaka writing, that is about 2000 years older than the first pictural-cuneiform writing in
Mesopotamia and since there are strong connections between the writings of the Sumerians and the
Indus Valley civilzation (Parpola 2000), that was the first major urban culture of South Asia and
reached its peak from 2600 B.C. to 1900 B.C. roughly, it is to assume, that the Sumerians wandered
westward to India from Mesopotamia. Also, from the 26th century on, the Akkadian pressure started in
Sumeria, so that we have to suppose political reasons for their emigration. For this early time of
wandering out of their homeland speaks also the fact, that only 36% of the Dravidian etymologies are
shared with the Sumerian-Hungarian ones. (Had Szabó used classical historical etymology instead of
semantically based “Wurzeletymologie”, the percentage would be even much lower.) Nevertheless, this
percentage is still higher than the percentage of relationship between Hungarian and the so-called
“Finno-Ugric langagues”, that ranges between 27 % and 33% (Tóth 2006a, 2006b).

13. Chinese and Hungarian

1. Introduction
Podhorszky (1877) compared a few thousand Hungarian etyma with Chinese, but without giving sound
laws. However, if we use this old work in the present article as a basis for our own etymologies, we
have to defend the author, since all the other Finno-Ugric dictionaries are by no means better, since
they do not provide us with sound laws, either. And this is true for most dictionaries of other language
families as well. One of the very few exceptions known to me is Starostin’s, Dybo’s and Mudrak’s
“Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages”. We will cite the Chinese forms like Podhorszky did
with two exceptions: We mark vowels (e.g. ă, ĕ) and indicate tones only in order to avoid homophones,
otherwise diacritica and explications like “barytonic” have been let away. Using as our basis again the
Sumerian-Hungarian word list from Gostony (1975), we get the following 638 Hungarian-SumerianChinese etymologies.
The following map shows the geographical distribution of Chinese and its neighbouring languages:

3. Conclusions
We find, that not less than 61% of the Sumerian-Hungarian etymologies appear in Chinese. This is a
very strong hint that obviously a big part of the Sumerians did not emigrate into the Carpathian Basin,
but to China and from there maybe they wandered to Tibet and possibly also to South Asia. But we
find another very interesting fact, I mean the Hokkjen forms, that are in 100% of the cases much closer
- 565 -

13. Chinese and Hungarian

to the modern Hungarian forms than the standard (Mandarin or Cantonese) Chinese forms given by
Podhorszky. We cite only a few examples: Hung. akarni, Chin. uh-juh “to wish”, Hokkjen ük, ak “id.”;
Hung. árnyék, Canton. nik “to hide”, Hokkjen njek “id.”; Hung. átok, Chin. to, ta “mutual curse”,
Hokkjen tok, tak “id.”; Hung. bok, Chin. muh “wood, tree”, Hokkjen bok “id.”; Hung. csapni, Chin.
cha “to hit”, Hokkjen chap “id.”. Yet, Hokkjen (or Hokkien) is a local variant of Minnan, spoken in
Penang and is characterised by the pronunciation of words according to the Zhang-Zhung language
(Haarh 1968). This extinct language belonged to the Tibetan branch of the Sino-Tibetan language
family, and must have been under the strong influence of the Hsiung-nu language of the Huns
(Hummel 1975, 1976), since there is no other possible explication about the very noticeable closeness
of the Hokkjen and the Hungarian forms. Now, the Huns, whose empire stretched from the steppes of
Central Asia into modern Germany and form the Danube river to the Caspian Sea, settled in Central
Asia approximately from the 4th to the 6th century A.D. And, as Podhorszky (1877, p. 125) remarks
correctly, the Chinese-Hungarian comparisons represent still a period of the language, when prefixes
were used. This points also to approximately the same time-span like the settlements of the Huns in
China and confirmes our assumption, that Zhang-Zhung must have been influenced stronly by Hsiungnu.

14. Japanese and Hungarian

1. Introduction
Since the appearance of Roy Andrew Millers book “Japanese and the Other Altaic Languages” (1971),
it is mostly, but not generally, assumed, that Japanese belongs together with Turkic, Manchu-Tungus
and Mongolian (and perhaps Korean) to the Altaic linguistic family. Most influenceful for this
assumption was Karl H. Menges review of Millers 1971 book (Menges 1974). Yet there is also not a
general, but at least a widespread agreement, that the forementioned languages form a family in the
linguistic sense. A big step towards acceptance was the publication of the “Etymological Dictionary of
the Altaic Languages” by Sergei Starostin, Anna Dybo and Oleg Mudrak (2003) with its 2800
etymologies: “After a critical evaluation of the problem we came to the conclusion that Altaic should
still be characterized as a genetic unity (...). The very fact that it is possible to compile a dictionary of
common Altaic heritage appears to be a proof of the validity of the Altaic theory (2003/I, p. 9).
This little map shows the geographical position of the Japanese language:

In the following, I compare Japanese with Hungarian, but not directly, as Kazár (1980) did it in the
whole range of all Uralic and Altaic languages, from whom we take our Japanese reflexes, but again via
their common Sumerian basis according to Gostony (1975), i.e. I compare his 1042 SumerianHungarian etymologies with the 594 Japanese-Hungarian etymologies in the Finno-Ugric dictionary
part of Kazár (1980, pp. 12-213). In doing so, we get 235 common Sumerian-Japanese-Hungarian
etyma, that I will present in the next chapter.

3. Conclusions
These 235 etyma correspond to 23% of the common Sumerian-Hungarian etyma in Gostony (1975)
and to 40% of the Japanese-Hungarian etyma in Kazár (1980). The relatively low rate of common
Sumerian-Hungarian-Japanese etyma may be interpreted as a hint, that we have not to assume – like
e.g. in the case of Tibeto-Burman and the Munda languages – a migration of Hungarians to Japan, but
rather that the common etyma are due to the fact, that Japanese is a member of the Ural-Altaic
macrofamily.

1. Introduction
To compare Turkish and Hungarian is kind of a risky business, since both languages claimed and still
claim to be the inheritors of the Sumerians, the representatives of the first high culture on earth. For
Turkish, one should consult the exhaustive study of Laut (2000), especially the chapters about the “Sun
Theory” (Güneş Dil Teorisi). Therefore, it is not astonishing at all that amongst the abundance of
comparative linguistic literature both on the Turkish and on the Hungarian side we find many treatises
that have been written more or less openly with nationalistic purposes. Moreover, the oldest Turkish
texts date from the 8th century B.C. and the oldest Hungarian texts from the 12th century B.C., while
Sumerian was extinct already around 1800 B.C., so that the time difference between the youngest
Sumerian and the oldest Turkish and Hungarian testimonies, respectively, are rather enormous – not to
speak about the philological problems involved in Sumerian. In order to avoid biased data, we thus
compare again Turkish and Hungarian not directly, but via their common Sumerian roots, using
The following map shows how widespread the Turkic languages are:

In the following, I present 577 Hungarian-Sumerian-Turkish etymologies. Yet, in very few cases I have
given a word from another member of the Turkic language family, when no Turkish etymology was at
hand (e.g. Chuvash, Chagatai, Yakut, Uighur), in one case (no. 722) I have even added an obvious
etymology by myself, since Sára must have forgotten it by chance. It must be pointed out, however,
that the present work cannot and does not want to be a comparative dictionary of the Turkic languages.
Whoever is interested in finding out, in which other Turkic languages than Turkish a certain reflex
- 602 -
exists, should consult the excellent “Etymological Dictionary of the Altaic Languages” by Starostin,
Dybo and Mudrak (2003) with its 2800 etymologies.

3. Conclusion
Via their common Sumerian roots, Turkish and Hungarian share 557 or 55% of their etyma from the

1042 etyma of the comparative Sumerian dictionary by Gostony (1975). This strongly points to a
common Sumerian origin of both the Turkic and the Hungarian people, that was already postulated by
Hommel (1915) and confirmes the early hypothesis of Ungnad (1927; 136, pp. 11ss.) that the cradle of
the Turkic people stood somewhere in the Oxus area in today’s Turkmenistan:

- 685 -
The Turkic languages play also an important role in the so-called Eurasian substrate (cf. chapter 9 and
Hummel 1991).
Since the Greek (Konstantinos Prophyrogennetos, 11th century) and the Arabic (Ibn Fadlan and others)
sources (10th century) constantly consider the Hungarians to be a Turkic people (cf. Moravcsik 1942,

1958), one may assume – in the light of the main result of the present study, i.e. the 55% of common
Sumerian-Turkish-Hungarian cognates -, that the Turkic people and the Hungarians may have
separated only after having still having lived together some centuries in today’s Turkmenistan after
wandering out of Sumeria. Therefore, the Hungarians, who were bound to the Carpathian Basin, could
not have taken – as it is generally assumed (cf. e.g. Bobula 1967) – the direct way from today’s Iran via
the Black Sea towards the north. This eastward instead of northward route would also explain, why
Friar Julianus found still in the 13th century Hungarians in Bashkiria, since Bashkiria lay – very roughly
speaking - on the way from Mesopotamia to the Oxus area and then in a huge semicircle-turn to the
Carpathian Basin. So, a few of this Sumerians, that were not to form the different Turkic people that
spread out from Eastern Europe to Sibria and even Western China, neither to become the ancestors of
the today’s Hungarians including the Csángós, must have settled in Bashkiria, where they were later
melted together with the Turkic speaking Bashkirians – after all originally their relatives.

16. Austronesian and Hungarian


16. Austronesian and Hungarian

1. Introduction
Many researchers assumed already very early that there is a strong linguistic connection between India,
China, Tibet, Burma, Japan and the Malayo-Polynesian archipelago (e.g. Kőrösi Csoma 1834/1984,
Podhorszky 1877, De Charency 1896, Uxbond 1928/2006, Matsumoto 1928, Rivet 1929). This is also
one of the reasons, while up to now the linguistic classification of the languages involved in this huge
area is still controversial. For example, Rivet (1929), from whose work we took the data for the present
article, considered amongst “Oceanian” not only Melanesian, Polynesian, Micronesian and Indonesian,
but also Mon-Khmer, Munda, Australian and Tasmanian. Nowadays, there is no classification, that
unites all these languages. We have chosen here the name “Austronesian”, to which we add – quite
unusually – also Mon-Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian. This decision has, however, rather practical
reasons than theoretical implications: The comparative corpora of the Australian and the Tasmanian
languages (extinct since 1905) with the other languages here under discussion are too small or not even
existing to be treated separately, so we follow Rivet (1929) with the only exception, that we do not take
into consideration the Munda languages here, because they are treated separately.
Another problem is, that Rivet (1929) does not make clear, which dictionaries he used for his booklet.
Furthermore, he does unfortunately not differentiate between the hundreds of languages that range
under “Melanesian, Polynesian, Indonesian”, etc. At the time, when Rivet wrote his word lists, the big
dictionaries of Traeger (1891) und Skeat/Blagden (1906) had appeared since a long time. Without any
doubt, Rivet could have enlargened his corpus massively, had he used this standard works. Considering
the fact, that Rivet brings on 46 pages only ca. 150-200 etymologies, while Gostony (1975) contains

1042 entries, it does not astonish, that the common Hungarian-Sumerian-Austronesian etymologies,
that we are able to present in the following, are so few, namely 82 or 3%. Therefore, here is still much
work to be done in the future: The systematical comparison of Gostony’s dictionary with Traeger,
Skeat/Blagden and most of all Dempwolff (1934-38) – and also with Brunner (1982).
Rivet, however, deserves the praise, that he was the first to understand and establish the linguistic
connection between what he calls Oceanian and Sumerian: “En résumé, du Japon à la Tasmanie, de la
Méditerranée et de l’Afrique à l’Amérique, on peut suivre pas à pas les multiples étapes, presque
exclusivement maritimes, des membres d’une seule et même famille linguistique, dont le centre de
dispersion paraît avoir été l’Asie méridionale ou l’Insulinde”. In other words: Rivet assumes a gigantic
substrate, that reaches from Japan to Tasmania, from the Mediterranean Sea and Africa to the Americas
and to the South Seas. This presupposes in accordance with the conviction of the present author, that
the Sumerians did not just “disappear”, but emigrated out of their homeland, probably under pressure
of Semitic people, who invaded already since the 26th century into Mesopotamia.

3. Conclusions
If one has a look at these 82 etymologies, one recognizes immediately, that most etymologies are
shining up in Melanesian and Indonesian, then in Polynesian, then in Australian, also often in MonKhmer, but more seldom in Tasmanian and very seldom in Micronesian. This does not support Rivet’s
assumption, that the Sumerians spread out from Oceania in order to build a far-reaching substrate, that
reaches from the South Seas to the Mediterranean and from Africa to the Americas. Our results suggest
the contrary assumption: That the Sumerians spread out from Mesopotamia via India, China, Tibet,
Japan further into the south and as far as Tasmania. As a matter of fact, they left there traces in the
Oceanian world, that reaches from Madagascar in the West to the Easter Islands in the East – more
than half a turn around the globe. The fact, that even so distant people like a Maori and a Hawaiian can
understand one another without bigger problems, shows that we have to assume in this far-reaching
area basically one huge substrate: the Sumerian, as was correctly assumed by Rivet (1929). Also von

16. Austronesian and Hungarian

Hevesy (1934, col. 670) assumes a settlement of the island of the Pacific Ocean that started in
Indonesia; already in the 5th century A.D. the Polynesians had reached Hawaii. But von Hevesy (who
deciphered the Easter Island script) also points to the remainders of a “gigantic neolithic culture” (loc.
cit.), that must have established between 5000-2000 B.C. in Oceania and thus fits perfectly in the timeframe of the assumed emigration of the Sumerians and the proven invasion of the Akkadians into
Mesopotamia.

17. Mayan languages and Hungarian

1. Introduction
Stig Wikander proved in three articles that the Mayan and the Altaic languages are genetically related
(Wikander 1967, 1970, 1970/71). Karl Bouda showed in a long series of articles the genetical
relationship between Altaic, Mayan and some other Meso- and South-American languages (nos. 148,

156, 158, 164, 166, 168, 172, 179, 182, 183, 197, 208, 220 in Schiefer 1975). Provided that the Altaic
and the Finno-Ugric languages are also genetically related to one another, it follows that Hungarian and
the Mayan languages must be genetically related, too. In the following, we use as data base for Mayan
the 3 volumes work of Dienhart (1989) with its ca. 40’800 entries of 31 Mayan languages. For
Hungarian we use again Gostony (1975).
The Mayan languages constitute a family of related languages spoken in Mesoamerica from
southeastern Mexico to northern Central America and as far south as Honduras. Their common
ancestor, known as Proto-Mayan, is reconstructed with a time depth of at least 5000 years, and many
Mayan languages are still spoken as a primary or secondary language by more than 4 million indigenous
Maya. The Mayan language family comprises five sub-families and includes many languages that are
spoken in Mexico, Guatemala and Belize. In Mexico, Mayan languages are spoken in seven states:
Chiapas, Tabasco, Yucatectán, Quintana Roo, Campeche, San Luis Potosí and Veracruz. In Chiapas, all
the languages are Mayan (except Zoque), as are virtually all the indigenous languages of Guatemala.
The following tree-model shows a possible linguistic evolution of the present Mayan languages from
Proto-Mayan:

3. Conclusions

111 Mayan words are shared with the 1042 Sumerian-Hungarian etyma of Gostony (1975), or 11%.
Since all the etymologies are mine, I handled them with special care. For example, the obvious
palatalisation k > č, found in many Mayan languages, was accepted, but in lack of further research the
palatalization t > č was excluded until evidence will prove this sound-law. Under the hypothesis that
this sound-law is valuable, we would have gotten about the double amount or 20-22% of common
Sumerian-Hungarian-Mayan etymologies. But still, with its 11%, the Mayan languages stand between
African and Japanese (Austronesian 3%, Caucasian 7%, African 8%, Japanese 23%, other Finno-Ugric
languages besides Hungarian 27%). Interestingly enough, most parallels between Sumerian-Hungarian
and Mayan languages are to be found in an area that comprises the northern and central parts of the
Yucatectán peninsula, northern Belize and parts of Guatemala. E.g. 39 parallels show up in Yucatecan,

36 in Itza, 35 in Mopan, etc. From the numbers 1, 2, 5 and 8 are conserved since Sumerian time in
today’s Mayan languages, even they are not even conserved in most of the so-called Finno-Ugric
languages, not to speak about the well-known almost complete absence of common number names in
the Altaic languages.
From the percentages it results, that the Sumerians had much more influence in Mesoamerica than they
had f.ex. in the Caucasus Mountains (where there was according to many researches their homeland!) or
in Africa, although these regions were extremely much closer of their Mesopotamian homeland. So, the
question arises: How and when did the Sumerians get to Mesoamerica? One would think of Swadesh’s
Bering-Street theory, since the genetical relationship between some Paleo-Sibirian languages in the Old
World and some Uto-Aztecan languages in the New World had been proved in the past 50 years. But,
unfortunately, neither in Yenissean, Chukchi, Kamtchadal or other languages Hungarian cognates are
to be found, even Bouda (cf. the bibliography of the respective works in Schiefer 1975) assumed a
genetical relationship of these and some other languages in the huge area around the North Polar Sea
with Finno-Ugric.
The only other alternative that has been brought up to now is Barry Fells’s Transatlantic Migration
Theory (cf. Fell 1977). As already mentioned in the introduction, Proto-Mayan is reconstructed at about

3000 B.C. At that time, according to Fell (1977), the first accidental transatlantic drift-voyages have
been made by Iberians and Libyans. It is clear, that they reached the south of North America, but did
they also reach Meso-America? And were Sumerians on these ships, too? According to Marini (1985,

1986, 1987), a Sumerian inscription was found in Fuente Magna, La Paz, Bolivia, whose date “may be
around or before the year 2000 B.C.” (Marini 1985, p. 10). A very special variant of early migrations
between Europe and the Americas was brought up by the Hungarian-Ecuadorian engineer Juan Moricz
(i.e. Móricz Opos János): According to him, “the magyars of the Carpathian Mountains (...) are of
American origin”, being survivors of the Deluge, “but those on the crests of the Andes were primarily
responsible for the post-diluvian dispersion of knowledge and culture: that between 8000 and 7000
B.C. they arrived in Lower Mesopotamia in boats made from balsa wood found only in South
America” (Hall 2005, cf. also Hary Györgyné 2003). This hypothesis, however, fails, because we know
through witness of their writing, that the Sumerians came from Transylvania to Mesopotamia (Badiny

2001).
We must assume, after all, that a very early migration brought Sumerians on ships (assumingly not their
own, but perhaps Libyan and Iberian ships) to America, maybe first to North and then from there to
South-America (since there are no indications for direct voyages of any people from the Old World to
- 743 -

Meso-America). This could have happen as early as a little after 3000 B.C., since from the 26th century
on, the intruding Akkadians started to torment the Sumerians and pushed them out of Mesopotamia.
Anyway, the Mayan languages are an important part of the huge Sumerian heritage spread out to all
continents by the ancestors of the today’s Hungarians.

18. Conclusions


18. Conclusions
In chapter 3, we found that from the ten Finno-Ugric languages Hungarian, Vogulic, Ostyak,
Syryen, Cheremis, Mordwin, Finnic, Estonian, Lapponic and the two Samoyed languages
Nganasan and Selkup, the Finno-Ugric group shares only 31.91% of common words – ranging
from 34% down to 10.0%, the two Symoyed languages only 22%, and therefore the average
percentage of all Uralic languages is as low as 26.95%. Given these calculations, according to
the Swadesh list and its related statistics, Proto-Uralic should have existed about 9000 years
ago, the separation of the Samoyed languages should have happened even 2000 years earlier –
in open contradiction with the fact, that then they split before they got a member of the
Proto-Uralic family, etc. What we want to point out is that the Uralic theory leads itself ad
absurdum.
On the other side, Hungarian shares 91% of its basic vocabulary with Sumerian and 7% with Akkadian,
the other big language spoken at about the same time in Mesopotamia, before the Sumerians started to
emigrate. Starting with the Sumerian-Hungarian theory, only 2% of the Hungarian words are
meanwhile still “of unknown origin”. However, in chapter 4, we showed, that according to four
standard etymological dictionaries of Hungarian, between 25% and 39% of the Hungarian words are
“of unknown origin” – and an extremely high percentage - probably more than 50% - is in addition to
them of “uncertain”, “difficult”, “problematic” etc. origin. We draw two conclusions out this facts:
First, the Finno-Ugric and Uralic theories at unscientific, because they contradict their own principles,
and second, there are neither a Finno-Ugric nor an Uralic language family. The few common words
that the Northern “Finno-Ugric” and the Samoyed languages share with Hungarian, have all their roots
in Sumerian and must therefore be explained via borrowing from Hungarian.
In the following, we shall show the respective percentages of shared cognates between Sumerian,
Hungarian and the other languages that have been scrutinized in this book:
Chapter 5:

Hungarian = Sumerian: 1042 words = 100%

Chapter 6:

Hungarian = “Finno-Ugric” languages: 31.9%

Chapter 7:

Hungarian = Caucasian: 7%

Chapter 8:

Hungarian = Bantu: 8%

Chapter 9:

Hungarian = Etruscan: 33% (but here the reference was not Gostony 1975)

Chapter 10:

Hungarian = Tibeto-Burman: ca. 50% (here, the reference was not Gostony 1975,
either)

Chapter 11:

Hungarian = Munda: 33%

Chapter 12:

Hungarian = Dravidian: 36%

Chapter 13:

Hungarian = Chinese: 61%

Chapter 14:

Hungarian = Japanese: 23%

Chapter 15:

Hungarian = Turkish: 55%

18. Conclusions

Chapter 16:

Hungarian = Austronesian (incl. Mon-Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian): 3%

Chapter 17:

Hungarian = Mayan: 11%

If we order these languages according to the percentages of their genetic relationship, we get:
Hungarian (100%) > Chinese (61%) > Turkish (55%) > Tibeto-Burman (ca. 50%) > Dravidian (36%)
> Munda (33%) = Etruscan (ca. 33%) > “FU” languages (31.9%) > Japanese (23%) > Mayan (11%) >
Bantu (8%) > Caucasian (7%) > Austronesian (incl. Mon Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian) (3%).

We can now draw the following conclusions:

1. The two “Turanian” languages Hungarian and Turkish show naturally a high percentage of genetic
relationship (55%), while the relationship between Hungarian and the other “Turanian” language
considered in this book, Japanese, is rather low (23%). Perhaps, this is a hint to do further research
in order to control if Japanese is really an Altaic language or not. Like Sumerian and Hungarian, all
“Turanian”, i.e. Ural-Altaic languages are agglutinative.

2. While the genetic relationship between Hungarian, Turkish and (probably) Japanese is not a
surprise, Kőrösi Csoma Sándor’s theory of a very significant Hungarian-related population in Tibet
is fully confirmed (ca. 50%). Like Sumerian and Hungarian, Tibetan is an agglutinative language, but
strangely enough with ablaut (apophony).

3. A surprise is that Dravidian has a higher percentage (36%) of genetic relationship than the Munda
languages (33%). But nevertheless, von Hevesy’s idea that the Munda-Khol family must be
accepted as another member of the “Finno-Ugric” languages, is confirmed. Both Dravidian and the
Munda languages are agglutinative like Sumerian and Hungarian.

4. Since the idea, that Etruscan and Hungarian may be genetically related, is pretty old, it is not a
surprise, that both languages share ca. 33% of their cognates. Like Sumerian and Hungarian,
Etruscan is agglutinative.

5. The “FU” languages, that share between 10% and 31.9% of their word stock, have already been
explained as genetically not related to Hungarian, their common vocabulary and certain grammatical
features, e.g. agglutination, being considered as borrowed.

6. A surprise are the 11%, that Hungarian shares with the Mayan languages. They are even 1% closer
related to one another than the two allegedly closely related Samoyed languages Naganasan and
Selkup. There can be no doubt, that there is a genetic relationship between Hungarian and the
Mayan languages, which may probably also explain, why the Mayan languages are agglutinative, too.

7. Bantu (%), Caucasian (7%) and Austronesian (incl. Mon Khmer, Australian and Tasmanian) (3%)
can hardly be considered genetically related to Hungarian, even Bantu and Caucasian are

18. Conclusions

agglutinative, too. The cognates shared between these languages and Sumerian may be explained by
wanderings of people of the Indian continent southwards.

8. After all, despite the knowledge that genetic relationship between languages does not follow
necessarily from the fact that these languages share certain typological features, it is rather
surprising and cannot be considered by change that from the 14 languages or language families, that
were researched in this book, 13 are agglutinative.
