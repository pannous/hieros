PREFACE

I, although the 'archaistic'

THE need for even a short Pahlavi-English dictionary has been
obvious for many years, particularly to would-be students of
the language. The glossarial part of Professor H. S. Nyberg's
Manual of Pahlavi is still eagerly awaited, five years after the
publication of Part
tradition of
transcription followed therein is no longer universally acceptable.
With the partial material at present available, every serious student
still has to compile his own dictionary, a formidable task with
Pahlavi and made more so by the plethora of different systems
of transcription in print. The present dictionary, admittedly
introducing yet another transcription, is intended first to relieve
the stranger to Pahlavi of the necessity of covering what is now
well-travelled ground-the commonest 4,000 simple words(cid:173)
without a unified map, and secondly to urge the practical value of
this'Sasanian' transcription for his journeying further. To have
included etymologies and textual references would have changed
the emphasis of the work, turning it from a map to a historical
atlas-cum-gazetteer, besides retarding its appearance unduly.
Such a complete dictionary of Pahlavi is nowhere within sight
and must remain so until many more texts are adequately edited.
For his good counsel on what to include in the dictionary I
am most grateful to my friend Dr. P. Gignoux of Paris, for
without him many common words would have slipped through
my net. Most of the labour of compiling the English index, which
will surely be appreciated, was undertaken by my wife. The
debt lowe to the teaching of the late Professor W. B. Henning,
in connection with Pahlavi and all things Iranian, cannot be
expressed in words.

It is again a pleasure to acknowledge the support of the School
of Oriental and African Studies in financing this publication,
and the customary skill of the printers.

INTRODUCTION

ALMOST every published list of Pahlavi words contains a number
of entries of doubtful nature, the uncertainty lying either in their
form, their meaning, or even, occasionally, their very existence.
The purpose of this dictionary is to provide the student with a
representative vocabulary of Pahlavi
in which such uncertain
words have been reduced to a minimum and marked. It differs
from its predecessors in that the Pahlavi words are given in a
phonemic transcription representing, as far as it is deducible
from the evidence, the pronunciation they would have had in the
third century of our era, the period of the rise of the Sasanian
empire. The reasons for this departure from the 'archaistic' tradi(cid:173)
If one reason
tion of Pahlavi studies I have given elsewhere. I
stands out it is that of practicality, as most corroborative evidence
comes from this period.

To reduce the number of doubtful words it has been necessary
to concentrate on the simpler vocabulary of such texts as the
Kārntimag i Ardaxlir, Dādestān i Minog i Xrad, Ardā Wirāz
nāmag, Bundahiln, and the Pahlavi Texts edited by Jamasp(cid:173)
Asana. Although I have also drawn upon the Pahlavi versions
of scriptural texts (Vendidad, Yasna, and Vispered), most of their
very special vocabulary has been omitted. So have the many
nonce-words and ad hoc compounds of religious texts such as the
Denkard, since it is generally a simple matter to analyse Pahlavi
compounds, given the elements and provided that the rules of
their construction are understood. Those words- calling for inclu(cid:173)
sion whose form or meaning remain doubtful are marked with an
asterisk.

By its nature the dictionary cannot claim to contain the entire
vocabulary of any particular text. Nor is there any express inten(cid:173)
tion of presenting new solutions to the many problems remaining
in the Pahlavi texts. Rather the readings of many scholars have

been adopted, eclectically, and grateful acknowledgement
is
hereby made to all whose discoveries have been assimilated within.
Nevertheless, I must retain responsibility for the choice as a
whole and for readings and interpretations unclaimed or un(cid:173)
published elsewhere.

TRANSLITERATION

The script of the Pahlavi books derives ultimately from that of
the official Aramaic of the Achaemenian empire. In the course of
time, however, a high degree of ambiguity has developed in the
script. Table I shows the development of the letters from
Imperial Aramaic (with the transliteration and names of letters
commonly used by Semitists), through the distinct forms used in
the Parthian and Persian inscriptions of the third century A.D., and
the archaic manuscript forms of the Psalter fragment (about
seventh century),1 to those of the Zoroastrian books. In addition
to the multiple values of the letters listed, some of them may
represent combinations of letters in certain contexts, e.g.. ,.t:; or J.'
for ~ + ...

Since the ambiguities ofthe script make a mechanical translitera(cid:173)
tion of one letter by one roman symbol of no practical value, a
certain amount of interpretation is essential. This interpretation
can be based, either directly or by the use of analogy, on the less
ambiguous evidence of the above-mentioned earlier documents
of the language. With this help it is possible to go far in distin(cid:173)
guishing between the original values ), ~, dy, etc., of .~, n, W, r
of ,
, and so on. But it is neither necessary nor desirable to go
beyond this by attempting to give closer 'phonetic' values to the
letters, such as r for written I, or x for written~. For example,
~~ ~wl represents xwar 'sun', but to transliterate it
·xwr
entails both confusion with the true letter r , and the introduc(cid:173)
tion of even greater ambiguity into the interpretation of .~. It
is better to accept that the scribes wrote r and I almost indis-

INTRODUCTION

It is common practice to distinguish the Semitic ideograms in
Pahlavi, from the Iranian elements, by transliterating them in
letters. Thus the same letters ,~ are transliterated
capital
lflyk l when they stand for rahig 'child', but LlfYK' when they
represent the ideogram for dār 'far'. However, as the ideograms
are often much distorted and disguised forms of the original
Aramaic words, it is sufficient for practical purposes to trans(cid:173)
literate them by means of a simplified system.

The system adopted hereafter in this book, for both ideographic
and Iranian spellings, is designed to avoid the use of diacritics as
far as possible and also to parallel the system now conventional
for the representation of the related Manichaean Middle Persian
and Parthian script. Each letter is throughout given its basic
Iranian value(s), thus c and C for Aramaic~, h and ā for Aramaic
fl. A represents the capital form of ) (>ālep). There are three
letters which occur only in ideograms: Q (in the word QDM =
abar; otherwise it is replaced by K), E, and O. E stands for the
Aramaic he (when it is not replaced by flet) and 0 for Aramaic
the roman letters being descendants of these Semitic
(ayin,
forms respectively. Thus OLE (= oy) is a form of shorthand for
an Aramaic original (lh, HeDL WN- (= *'drān-) indicates a
corruption of the Aramaic root fl~d. Purists will find no difficulty
in restoring the forms with diacritics.

Pahlavi letters are often distorted, or joined irregularly, in such
a way that they coincide with other letters, so producing even
greater ambiguity. The commonest distortions are here noted by
under- or over-lining the letter value intended. Thus:


The full scheme of transliteration is given in Table ā. The
order is still that of the Aramaic alphabet, taking account of the
first value of each letter.

INTRODUCTION

Notes

I. ~ 'h, etc., may be a corruption of final -ydy, so -&.
2. -y, besides -yoY, etc., may be a corruption of -h, so -lJ.
3. The digraphs ~ and 1ft, when they follow a verbal
ideogram, may represent any 'phonetic complement' (including
zero). They can be transliterated, purely for mnemonic purposes,

by the letters they resemble :~ as yt and * as ty. I
4. i.e. an otiose stroke.
S. ~ yt, etc. t may bea corruption of to -sn, so -§tJ.t and

~ (following another letter) may be for \(. -e l , so _~I.

TRANSCRIPTION

The orthographic principles followed, in seemingly haphazard
permutation, in the writing of Pahlavi, besides the ideographic,
include the phonetic (within the limits of the alphabet), the his(cid:173)
torical,
the pseudo-historical, and others so indeterminable as
scarcely to merit the name. The establishment of the original
spelling of a word, thereforet very seldom reveals its pronuncia(cid:173)
tion. To determine this it is necessary to examine all the available
comparative evidence.

Since the discovery of the Iranian material written in the near(cid:173)
phonetic Manichaean script it has become possible to establish
a hypothetical phonemic system for Middle Persian and Parthian
of the third century A.D. far more accurate than before, when only
the remoter evidence of Old Iranian, New Persian, and loanwords
in other languages (particularly Armenian) was available. A
description of this phonemic system has been given in my article
cited above. Within its terms all the entries in this dictionary are
transcribed.

The system comprises the following phonemes:


'Remarks on the Pahlavi ligatures ..Ul and 1ft',

Bulletin of the School of Oriental Studies, vāi, pt. 2 (1936), 391-403.

INTRODUCTION

(I) The phonemic status of e and 0 is doubtful and they are
only marked when there is direct evidence of their occurrence.

(2) Only in non-Persian, i.e. 'learned' or loaned, words.
The phonetic realizations of these phonemes can only be sup(cid:173)
posed to have been similar to those of the corresponding sounds
of present-day Western Iranian speech. The only allophonic
variation of importance concerns the voiced stops b, (d ?), g, and
affricate J. Between a vowel and a following consonant, in the
same morpheme or close juncture, these almost certainly became
the fricatives fP, (8), y, z] respectively. Thus abd, tigr, duJden
represent pronunciations C*apd, tiyr, duzden]. How far, or when,
this development affected the same phonemes elsewhere in post(cid:173)
vocalic position is uncertain. It is sufficient to regard [P, 8, ')I, z]
as possible realizations of postvocalic b, d, g, j.1

USING THE DICTIONARY

In seeking an unknown word, or one known only in another
transcription, it may be necessary first to find it in the Pahlavi
key. The English-Pahlavi index is intended to serve as an aid to
memory, and for tracing synonyms, etc., but is emphatically not
an English-Pahlavi dictionary.

The main entries, with two exceptions, are arranged throughout

in the following order:

i, b, c, d, I, I, g (y), h, l, J, k, I, m,
0,6, p, r, s, S, t, ā, w, x, y, z (f).

I This [y] is an allophone of the Persian phoneme 11, while y of the
transcription is a non-Persian phoneme. Parthian also had a phoneme!,
replacing Persian J.

xvi
The exceptions are:

INTRODUCTION

(i) abstract nouns ending in -ih [-yh], which immediately
follow the words from which they are derived, e.g. stārih after
stār, before sturg;

(ā) verbal nouns formed from the present stems by the suffix
-isnih

-isn [-In'] and their derivatives in -isnig [-lnyh l ],
[-lnyh], which are all listed under the verb.

Verbs are quoted in the infinitive form, followed by the present
stem, except when either of these is not certainly attested. Cross
references are made where necessary.

Not all verbal derivatives are included if they are regularly
deducible from the 'principal parts' of the verbs given, e.g. actor
nouns in -dar/-tar [-t'l], and past participles in -dag/-ta~
[-th'], corresponding to infinitives in -dan/-tan [-tn l ]
; the abstract
nouns in -ih formed from these (e.g. -darih, -dagih); agent
nouns in -a~ [-'hI] formed from present stems, etc.

THE ENTRIES

Pahlavi words are always given in bold type. The few entries
in italics are concessions to another transcription, made for
reference.

P before a main entry indicates that the word is found only in
texts of Parthian origin, namely the Ayadgar i Zariran and
Draxt i Asārig.

An asterisk denotes that the transcription or reading of the

word is unconfirmed and remains doubtful.

Within square brackets the following information is given:
(i) The transliteration of the Pahlavi spelling.

In the case of
ideograms this is followed immediately by an indication of the
Aramaic (A) origin of the spelling. With verbs this can seldom
be given more closely than by the form of the Aramaic root.

When the Pahlavi spelling of the present stem of a verb coin(cid:173)
cides with part of that of the infinitive, however much they differ
in transcription, the transliteration is given in abbreviated form,
with a hyphen. Thus lkwp-tn l denotes 'infinitive lhwptn l
(= skuftan), present stem lhwp- (= skof-)', YMYTWN-tn l

xvā
denotes 'infinitive YMYTWNtn' (= murdan), present stem
YMYTWN- (= mir-)'.

INTRODUCTION

(ā) Evidence supporting the transcription.
For 'learned' words taken from the Avesta the form which the
Pahlavi represents, however corruptly, is quoted (as '= Av.').I
In such cases the Pahlavi transcriptions are more hypothetical
than usual, since they can be no more than probable representa(cid:173)
tions of the contemporary pronunciation of these words.

Justification of the transcription of each word would require
the discussion of a mass of etymological and comparative evidence
far beyond the scope of this dictionary. Only that evidence is
included, therefore, which is most closely related and lends itself
to concise and regular presentation.

After the vertical stroke the corresponding forms from Mani(cid:173)
chaean Middle Persian (M) and/or Parthian (P) are given wherever
possible. The appearance of only a Parthian form does not
necessarily imply that the Pahlavi word is of non-Persian origin.
It may be that the identical Middle Persian form is not attested
in Manichaean script.

Later forms of the word are quoted from Judaeo-Persian
(J-from whatever source) and the earliest New Persian (N(cid:173)
rarely in their Arabic guise, when this has displaced the Persian,
Ar.).

When the forms presented are not directly comparable, being
from a different dialect or in some way modified (e.g. by popular
etymology), they are enclosed in parentheses.

wen-, ,-,isn(-i~), v. didan.

(I) ... ,\~ is an ideographic spelling of wen-, present stem
of didan. It consists of the letters H, Z (reduced to a shape of
G), Y, T, W, N, being a (normal) Pahlavi development from
the Aramaic root I}zy. The infinitive (3) has the 'phonetic com(cid:173)
plement' -tn', for the -dan of didan.

(7) \\tW dytn l spells the infinitive didan, and (4) -,.., wyn(cid:173)

the present stem wen-.

In Manichaean Middle Persian the corresponding forms are
spelt dydn, wyn- respectively, indicating the same pronunciation.
In New Persian the infinitive is still didan, but the present stem
has become, regularly, bin-.

The verbal noun wenisn may be written part ideographically
(2) HZYTWNln' or (phonetically' (6) urynln'. The derived adjec(cid:173)
tive wenisnig is attested in the spelling (5) urynlnyk' (but could
occur as HZYTWNlnyk l ).

⟨LḤMʼ⟩=Nahn

**
In both Inscriptional and Book Pahlavi, many common words, including even pronouns, particles, numerals, and auxiliaries, were spelled according to their Aramaic equivalents, which were used as logograms. For example, the word for "dog" was written as ⟨KLBʼ⟩ (Aramaic kalbā) but pronounced sag; and the word for "bread" would be written as Aramaic ⟨LḤMʼ⟩ (laḥmā) but understood as the sign for Iranian nān.[16] These words were known as huzvarishn.
⟨ʼB-tr⟩ or ⟨pytr⟩ for pitar "father"
For example, tō "you" (singular) was spelt ⟨LK⟩ (Aramaic "to you", al-ku including the preposition l- ). <> ANte-KU

A Sumerogram is the use of a Sumerian cuneiform character or group of characters as an ideogram or logogram rather than a syllabogram in the graphic representation of a language other than Sumerian, such as Akkadian or Hittite.

=> HIGH DEGREE OF AMBIGUITY

Problems in reading Book Pahlavi

Ohrmazd (Ahura Mazda) read as Anhoma by Parsi!
**
⟨ʼwhrmzd⟩, a fairly straightforward spelling for an abjad. However, ⟨w⟩ had coalesced with ⟨n⟩; ⟨r⟩ had coalesced, in the spelling of certain words, with both ⟨n⟩ and ⟨w⟩; and ⟨z⟩ had been reduced, in the spelling of certain words, to a form whose combination with ⟨d⟩ was indistinguishable from a ⟨ʼ⟩, which in turn had coalesced with ⟨h⟩. This meant that the same orthographic form that stood for ⟨ʼwhrmzd⟩ could also be interpreted as ⟨ʼnhwmh⟩ (among many other possible readings).

WHAT DE FUUUUCK!!!

For this reason, important religious texts were sometimes transcribed into the 
phonetically unambiguous Avestan alphabet. This latter system is called Pazend.
