## Traces of Old Egyptian in Eurasian languages  

### Historical Context  

To linguists in the 19th centuries, it came as a revelation when they discovered that the old Persian and Sanskrit words for family members were virtually identical to [European](PIE) variants:  

cuneiform|transcribed|english|letters  
--|--|--|--  
𐎶𐎠𐎫𐎠			|MaTa 	|mother  |𐎶=M 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎱𐎡𐎫𐎠			|PiTa	|father  |𐎱=P 𐎡=I 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
𐎲𐎼𐎠𐎫𐎠		|BraTa	|brother |𐎲=B 𐎼=R 𐎠=A 𐎫=T 𐎠=A  
*𐎯𐎧𐎬𐎠		|Duxtua	|daughter  
𐎱𐎢𐏂			|Pučun  | puer/son  

Even now, 2500 years after Persians hammered those words into stone, the modern Farsi(Iranian) words are almost identical, surviving an Arabian conquest and millenia of separation, but reinforced by international relationships and intermarriages:  

Farsi|transcribed|english  
-----|-----------|-------  
مامان 	|mâmân 	|mother  
مادر 	|mâdar 	|mother(formal)  
بابا 	|bâbâ 	|father  
پدر 	|pedar 	|father(formal)  
برادر   |barâdar|brother  
دختر 	|doxtar |daughter  
پسر 	|pesar 	|son  

This (re)discovery lead to well established theories of [Proto-Indo-European](PIE) expansions. Here we investigate the relationship between these [pioneers](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) and the Pharaonic Egyptian language and culture.  

First, we take a step back to the region where the PIE journey began:  
The countries surrounding the black sea.

In 5000BC the **Danube [Vinča civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture)** pioneered advanced copper technology, in 4200BC Romanian [Varna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varna_culture) hordes contain more gold artifacts than all other sites of that time combined, turning a formerly egalitarian society into a more violent one lead by an **elite**.

Only recently has the Caucasian [Maykop culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maykop_culture) been redated to begin about 4000BC. As it contains more gold and artifacts from Sumer than the rest of the whole Mesopotamia, its central position in the formation of urbanization becomes more and more evident. Their [kurgan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurgan) mounts, some still reaching over 50 meters height, can be seen as predecessors of Egyptian, [Iranian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepe_Sialk) and [Peruvian pyramids](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral), which appeared some thousand years later. Central to this revolution were a bag of inventions, including *metallurgy*, *brewing*, proto-*writing*, *kingship* and the ***sail*** boat, which became a cult object in the [Ubaid period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period) - 3800BC. The first **carts** pulled by bulls, donkeys or horses appeared about the same time. This [Curgan Copper Conquest](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) reached Egypt comparatively late, though one of its watermarks, [industrial brewing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298191529_City_of_the_hawk_-_From_ancient_breweries_to_the_earliest_mummies_excavations_at_Hierakonpolis_are_rewriting_the_origins_of_Egyptian_civilization), can be found as early as 3700BC. History often progresses in rising tides, but sometimes it spills over the world like a tsunami. Still this new dramatic wave reached remote China a thousand years later, the real push there came with the chariots.  

# Inventions  

Central to the chalcolithic revolution were a bag of inventions, including **metallurgy**, **brewing**, proto-*writing*, **kingship** and the **sail** boat, which became a cult object in the [Ubaid period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubaid_period) - 3800BC. The first **carts** pulled by bulls, donkeys or horses appeared about the same time. Trade exploded in the so called [secondary products revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_products_revolution): Industrial **milk**, **wool** **wheel** and **wine** production, the first **leather** shoes in Europe and Armenia…

In Jiroft, south Iran, a 5000 year old woman with a golden eye implant was [discovered](http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Iran_s_Burnt_City.htm). With an outstanding 1.82 m (6 feet) she was much taller than ordinary women of her time (⋍3000BC). We anticipate that genetic tests will show that she was indeed part of the proto-indo-european founding stock. In the mean time we have new finds of [blue eyed immigrants](https://www.livescience.com/63396-ancient-israel-immigration-turkey-iran.html) bringing bronze to Galilee, red haired mummies in Egypt (Ramses and Gebelein), and a landmark study of [mummy DNA](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15694), revealing that Egyptians where **closest related to Copper Age European**, Anatolian and Levant cultures:

Further East the Copper Age quickly spread via [[Maykop]] and Sumeria to Susa/Iran and by 4000BC had reached [[Mehrgarh]], the gate of the Indus Valley civilization: The oldest known example of the lost-wax technique comes from a 6,000-year-old copper, wheel-shaped amulet found at Mehrgarh, Pakistan. On their way they picked up the technology of **channel** building, a most important addition to their already impressive technological bag of inventions. The brotherhood of copper kings should soon apply it to many renowned rivers.  

This [Curgan Copper Conquest](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution) reached Egypt comparatively late, though one of its watermarks, [industrial brewing](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/298191529_City_of_the_hawk_-_From_ancient_breweries_to_the_earliest_mummies_excavations_at_Hierakonpolis_are_rewriting_the_origins_of_Egyptian_civilization),can be found as early as 3700BC, especially in the so called South Egyptian [A-Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Group_culture). Unfortunately 

The roots of the Persian language came via the region of Elam, south Iran, with its capital Susa on the eastern border of Sumeria. Strikingly, the cultural artifacts of Egypt and Susa were nearly identical:  

![susa-egypt.png](susa-egypt.png)  
Near identical building plans of the early temples and very similar early Egyptian and Sumerian [ceremonies](Hieros-gamos) clearly demonstrate that these are not mere trade-artefacts, but in fact proof of a common anchestry of both higher civilizations.  

Some context of this urbanization can be explored in the paper the [Kurgan Copper Revolution](https://www.academia.edu/14001057/Kurgan_Copper_Revolution)  

If nothing else, the little introduction above demonstrates how well the world was connected even before the building of the pyramids. Proto-Indo-Europeans are sometimes treated as if they stopped at the gates of the superpowers of the time (Sumeria, Susa and Egypt) and had little or nothing to do with its elite. Nothing could be further from the truth.  

Here, we investigate how deeply the roots go and how the Egyptian system, its [cosmology](cosmos) and language are intertwined with our own:  

The Egyptian Hieroglyphic writing system started as a syllabary[➾](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabary) but soon converged to a rather small set of frequent signs and sounds plus [determinants](Determinants) (like [𓈉](𓈉) for land).  

One of the most recognizable letters is '𓃀' with the phonetic value 'b':  

Babylon is written [𓃀](𓃀)[𓃀](𓃀)[𓂋](𓂋)[𓏤](𓏤)[𓈉](𓈉) b.b.l.[1](Numbers)(𓈉land) (or b.b.r)  

Using the conventional Egyptian [alphabet](Alphabet) in its late form, which is preserved to us by comparisons with the derived Coptic and demotic languages, as well as comparisons to Greek and Semitic languages.

With this alphabet, which linguist deciphered 200 years ago, and which received only minor modifications since then, we can start to decipher words:  

[𓃀](𓃀)[𓇋](𓇋)[𓅱](𓅱)[𓆤](𓆤)𓏨  [𓃀](𓃀)=b [𓇋](𓇋)=i/e [𓅱](𓅱)=[𓍢](𓍢) bee [𓆤](𓆤)  

One cognate match might be coincidence, especially one with so few syllables, a whole cluster of words hints at connections which need refreshed investigations:  

We subscribe to the [idea](Eurasian) that central words of frequent use and large semantic clusters have a much lower probability of mutating than other words, similar to ultra-conserved genes. Especially if they are codefied as those words that had a glyph of their own.  

Sumerian / Akkadian cuneiform is notorious for having sometimes half a dozen readings for a single sign. Fortunately, in Egypt, there are fewer signs with ambiguous readings, which makes interpretation much less arbitrary, and much less error-prone.  

It is impossible to reconstruct the exact phonetic reading, which probably varied within dialects and centuries, so all we can do is align the alphabetic consonant letters with their cognates:

Is this all a German hoax from the 19th century? The alphabet and the standard reading of signs were developed by French, English and Semitic scholars, so it all seems genuine.  

The list goes [on and on](https://github.com/pannous/hieros/raw/master/dicts/my_egyptian_dictionary.csv), most interesting are the Egyptian [[Grammar]] and [[Numbers]].

This Discovery is not entirely new, Dr. Christian De Vartavan, head of the Armenian Egyptology Center released several [papers](https://www.google.de/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiA0MjT2dDYAhUEJlAKHa-8C0MQFggzMAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academia.edu%2F357726%2FSeveral_Ancient_Egyptian_numerals_are_cognates_of_Indo_European_or_Proto_Indo_European_equivalents&usg=AOvVaw0RUWGKPhtGirffrH_29yU6) on the subject. In fact this observation was more widely spread before the second world war, after which it became taboo. Either because the Nazis abused the Indo-Europaen data for their ideology, or because of the undeniable strong connections between Egyptian and Semitic languages; the later however is not a contradiction:  

Egyptian could be related to Afro-Asiatic *and* Eurasian languages.  

In order to appreciate the deep relationship which goes beyond lexical interbreeding, one needs to study the [Grammar](Grammar). It seems surprisingly compatible with Indo European. No feature of the grammar forbids a common ancestry, many similarities corrobate one.  

Once it is accepted there is that there is a connection between Egyptian and European languages, we can postulate that '𓃀' b belongs to the ultra-preserved [Eurasian](Eurasian) 'pod'-cluster (all meaning 'leg'):  

cognate|language  
--|--  
پَا‎ pā| Persian  
pāy, padistān | Persian  
𒉽𒄬Pa… | Sumerian  
pod | Greek  
ⲫⲁⲧ | Coptic  
la pierna | Spanish  
láb | Hungarian  
Bein | German  
b…𓃀 | Egyptian  

Related English words:  
𓃀 boot, lab⋍leg, and hundred other derived terms in this cluster.  

At this stage, it is too early to assess which of the European cognates matches best the Egyptian variant.  
And when exactly was 𓃀 read as something similar to Bein, pierna, pā, pod, 𒉽𒄬, PapHalf, PaDemi, 𒁇bar 𒈦pár  … ?  

1) during the [formation period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-Group_culture) as suggested above  
2) constantly as one reading among several  
3) constantly as the main reading  
4) reinterpretation of the glyphs at the Hyksos invasion?  
5) in the advent of Christian religion (re-reading / re-alliance)?  

Given the antiquity of Sanskrit and its astonishing similarity to western languages, all seem possible.  

The influence of written letters on spoken vernacular has probably been underestimated.  
Ever repeating recitations can preserve or shift whole languages.  

Remember the Persian words for mother and father?  
Here are the (deified) Egyptian variants:

[𓈖](𓈖)[𓏏](𓏏)[𓂋](𓂋)[𓏯](𓏯)[𓅐](𓅐)|𓈖=𐊎𐊪 𓏏=T 𓂋=R 𓏯| Nνture| (Mother) vulture |  
[𓅭](𓅭)| sA' | [χήν](Genesis) x̌aŋ| son  
[𓅭](𓅭)[𓏏](𓏏)| 𓅭 𓏏=t |sAta/[δ](demi)Ata ?|daughter 𓅭=duck𓏏=ta  

Because the exact original phonetics are impossible to reconstruct, the suggested reading must be consumed with fine Sahara salt.  

Crazy, but possible: The suspicious looking 𓅭=duck in the word 𓅭𓏏 daughter (𓅭=duck𓏏=ta) is part of the [Indo-European vocabulary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_vocabulary), i.e. in Persian duck = ordak . If nothing else, a fabulous mnemonic which makes Egyptian more accessible than most other languages. In fact, given its relative simple [Grammar](Grammar) and it's central position in the language families, every student of linguistics should learn it. Egyptian is riddled with [puns](puns), making formal analysis at times difficult, but not less accessible.  

… common expression:  [𓅭](𓅭)[𓇳](𓇳) sA'Ra = son of the sun = ★sonray?  

Egyptologists followed the path of the lowest common denominator, with the bizarre result that quite a few words are reduced to mere sequences of vowels, i.e. [𓂣](𓂣)[𓉻](𓉻)[𓄿](𓄿) = a.a.a  (magnify)  
We offer working hypothesis and phonetic readings for most signs outside the alphabet, including yet silent [Determinants](Determinants). Similarly, we reject that the four signs [𓇋](𓇋)=(f)e 𓏏=t 𓆑=v 𓀀 in 'father' should be reduced to a mere 'it' as in some modern dictionaries.  

This obviously needs further work, but the case should be reopened.  

In the past linguists focused on demonstrating that Semitic languages are the mothers of Egyptian. In the future, it should be reexamined whether some fathers came from further north. Even before the arrival of the chariot.
