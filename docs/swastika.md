The now infamous [Swastika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika) symbol is a sad witness for how facts about the proto-indo-european expandsion where intermingled with nationalist Propaganda.  

Unfortunately it is still a good trace marker for early urbanisation:  

European hypotheses of the swastika are often treated in conjunction with cross symbols in general, such as the sun cross of pagan Bronze Age religion. The symbol's origin has its certain presence in the "proto-writing" symbol systems, such as the [Vinca](Vinca) script, which appeared during the Neolithic:

Afterwards it appeared in Sumerian and Harappian civilizations:

It is one of most common symbols found on Mesopotamian coins (from 500BC?).

Its relationship with the following symbols needs further investigation:
