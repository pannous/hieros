[Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language) is the consensus Theory in which many of the commonly spoken languages in the world from English to Hindi derive from one pioneering group of 'settlers' who conquered the world with horses some ⋍5000 years ago.  

Here this theory is extended in that 'Proto-Indo-Europeans' did not stop at the gates of Sumeria and Egypt, but that they went straight through them. Either by forming the founding brotherhood of the international elite (which is depicted in Egyptian or Armana letters), or at the very least being in continuous strong contact with the ancient superpowers, leaving tremendous marks on all languages of Eurasia [and Egypt](Highlights).

In other countries the brotherhood of kings formed a superimposed international elite ruling the natives. A queen of [Jiroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiroft_culture) in Iran ⋍3000BC was 1.80 tall with red hair and a golden eye implant. 99% of modern [R1a](https://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_R1a_Y-DNA.shtml) descends from R1a1a (M417), a subclade that clearly expanded from the Bronze Age onwards. R1b Maykop, Mosopotamia, Levant, GB! J2 Tyre, Ray, Elam vs J1 Arab. Admixture of R1a,R1b,J2 moving SE.  

These genetic traits were carried by the Copper Kings:

R1a1a1 8500bp-5500bp [M417](https://www.yfull.com/tree/R-M417/)  
T2 rare but very Caucasian (+Alps)  
G2a Interesting seaborn(!) Caucasian, south Anatolian, Iranian and Roman traits.  
J2a Caucasian, Turk, Mediteran without strong branch [J-Z600](https://www.yfull.com/tree/J-Z600/) vs J2b1 Arabian  
U2, I1 Nordic backdrop with I2 hotspot in Dalmatia  
E1 Berber with interesting E-V13 diaspora in [Montenegro and Ural](https://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_E1b1b_Y-DNA.shtml).

**Noticably the Caucasus was a hotspot for G2,J2,T1 and R1, making the [Maykop](Maykop) culture even more central in the history of urbanization!**  On the other hand genetic hotspots might indicate that these regions were secluded from 'modern' genes.

Ancient Egyptians had little to no genetic kinship with sub-Saharan populations.  
Strikingly, the mummies were more closely related to ancient Europeans and Anatolians than to modern Egyptians. The mummies in the study were of middle-class people, not royalty. "There was no detectable change for those 1,800 years of Egyptian history," Krause said. "The big change happened between then and now."

They set out to conquer the world and conquer they did:

Most of the white countries and the white northern countries spoke some indo-european through some or much of their history!  

The first predynastic mummy in [Gebelein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebelein_predynastic_mummies) had red hair. So did Ramesses II!  
![](https://www.beyondsciencetv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/download-44.jpg)  

There is a theory suggesting that before 2000 BC, Egyptians were of Caucasoid-European ethnicity. This is supported by the physical anthropology of the oldest mummies that have been found, the busts and statues of several pharaohs and their wives, the colored wall paintings discovered, and the descriptions provided in historical accounts.

[[Moral]]:  
Famous DNA researcher David [Reich](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/ancient-dna-history/554798/?single_page=true) once had German collaborators drop out of a study when the findings seemed to mirror too closely Nazi propaganda about the Aryan race.  

A queen of [Jiroft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiroft_culture) in Iran ⋍3000BC was 1.80 tall with red hair and a [golden eye implant](http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Iran_s_Burnt_City.htm). The first predynastic mummy in Egyptian Gebelein had [red hair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gebelein_predynastic_mummies) too.  

"DNA is doing is it’s forcing the hand of this discussion in archaeology, showing that in fact, major movements of people do occur. They are sometimes sharp and dramatic, and they involve large-scale population replacements over a relatively short period of time."  

Hitler maybe forever destroyed the opportunity for scientists to have a rational unpolitical discussion about finds like these in Ancient Israel (then called Galilee) : https://www.livescience.com/63396-ancient-israel-immigration-turkey-iran.html
