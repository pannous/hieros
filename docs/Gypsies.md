Gypsies have they name from the fact that they claim to come from Egypt.  
Their ancestry goes back to India: Sinthi and [Roma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people)  
Thus ethnically they are grouped as indo-aryan.  
The Dom (also called "Doma" and "Domi"; Arabic: دومي‎ / ALA-LC: Dūmī , دومري / Dūmrī ; Egyptian Arabic: هناجره‎ Hanagra )  
they speak the [Romani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language) language  
Interestingly Roman(ⲣⲱⲙⲓ) in coptic means human.  

as they belong to the indo-european stuff we can recognise parts of that language:  

present imperative - ker! ⇔ [𓂓](𓂓) kar = work  

te ker.el -to do ⇔ [𓂓](𓂓) ⇔ kardan karman …  "takecare"  suffix -l 3rd person  
te [ha](Hase).l - to eat  

[pronouns](Pronouns) are quite European:  

| person | singular |	plural |  
|--------|----|----|  
1.ps 	|me kerav| 	a[men](men) keras  
2.ps 	|tu keres| 	tumen keren  
3.ps 	|jov kerel| 	jon keren  

past tense with +d just like English or some Egyptian:  
past conditional - tu kerďalas (ker + **d** + 'al + as)  

Romani is a free word order language[20] and that it allows for theme-rheme structure, similarly to Czech or Hebrew, and that in some Romani dialects in East Slovakia, there is a tendency to put a verb at the end of a sentence:  

    Odi kuči šilaľi. - This cup is chilly(cold)  
    Oda šilaľi kuči. - This is a chilly cup.  

A form similar to Oda acted as predecessor for our words: This, da(there), esta(is)
