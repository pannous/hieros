Eurasiatic is a proposed language macrofamily that would include many language families historically spoken in northern, western, and southern Eurasia.  

[Eurasiatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasiatic_languages) resembles Nostratic in including Uralic, Indo-European, and Altaic, but differs from it in excluding the South Caucasian languages, Dravidian, and Afroasiatic and including Chukotko-Kamchatkan, Nivkh, Ainu, and Eskimo–Aleut. It was propounded by Joseph Greenberg in 2000–2002.  

In 2013, [Mark Pagel](http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/110/21/8471.full.pdf), Quentin D. Atkinson, Andreea S. Calude, and Andrew Meadea published statistical evidence that attempts to overcome these objections. According to their earlier work, most words exhibit a "half-life" of between 2,000 and 4,000 years, consistent with existing theories of linguistic replacement. However, they also identified some words – numerals, pronouns, and certain adverbs – that exhibit a much slower rate of replacement with half-lives of 10,000 to 20,000 or more years. Drawing from research in a diverse group of modern languages, the authors were able to show the same slow replacement rates for key words regardless of current pronunciation. They conclude that a stable core of largely unchanging words is a common feature of all human discourse, and model replacement as inversely proportional to usage frequency.

The strongest connections can be found between Indo-European and [Finno-Uralic](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Uralic_Swadesh_lists) languages, yielding the concept of [Indo-Uralic_languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Uralic_languages).

Quoth:
    «If all these and many other resemblances that might be adduced do not prove the common origin of Aryan and Ugrian, and if we assume that the Ugrians borrowed not only a great part of their vocabulary, but also many of their derivative syllables, together with at least the personal endings of their verbs from Aryan, then the whole fabric of comparative philology falls to the ground, and we are no longer justified in inferring from the similarity of the inflections in Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit that these languages have a common origin.»


This page picks up on main evidence in including [Egyptian](Grammar) and [Kartvelian](Kartvelian) to be part of a bigger **Eurasian** language family. 

[Uralic](Uralic) and [Dravidian](Dravidian) languages also seem to be distantly related, even [Khmer](Khmer)
