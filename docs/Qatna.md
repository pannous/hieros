First known occupation during the Late Chalcolithic IV period (3300–3000 BC)  

Aside from an obscure passage in the 20th-century BC Egyptian Story of Sinuhe, where the name Qatna is not clearly mentioned, the earliest occurrence of the name comes from the Middle Bronze Age archive of Mari, where the city is mentioned as "Qatanum",[6] an Akkadianized format (ālQa-ta-nimki). In Alalakh, the name "Qa-ta-na" was used,[9][10] an Amorite format that was shortened into Qatna during the Late Bronze Age.[7][5] The name is Semitic;[11] it derives from the root q-ṭ-n, meaning "thin" or "narrow" in a number of Semitic languages such as Akkadian, Syriac, and Ethiopian.[2] "Ga-da-nu" from the Eblaite archive may also derive from that root.[2] The toponym "Qatna" is strictly related to waterways and lakes;[2] this could be a reference to the artificial narrowing that created a lake from the springs located southwest of the city, since Qatna grew on the eastern shore of a now dried lake.  

The city lay along the central wadi (Zorat),[15] surrounded by at least twenty five satellite settlements.  
The early city, dating to the Early Bronze Age IV (2200–2100 BC), was built in a circular plan;  


The royal palace. Covering an area of 400m*400m: 16,000 square metres (170,000 sq ft), it was the biggest palace in the Levant of its time.  

Mishrifeh Lake. Qatna grew on the shore of a lake that dried completely toward the end of the Bronze Age, in c. 1200 BC. When the defenses were constructed, the northern and western parts of the rampart were built inside the lake, dividing it into an inner lake fed by a spring located in the northern foot of the upper city,[54] while the larger part locked outside the walls constituted a reservoir for the inhabitants.
