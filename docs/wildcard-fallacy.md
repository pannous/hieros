wildcard fallacy  

one sign generating all words 'PTRM=VCLN'  

There are universal sound changes and seemingly odd changes specific to languages.  

It is often reasonable to assume a very blurred out distribution for a particular Reading:  

Look at the cluster Pod-Pfote-bein-boot-foot-ferse ... covering everything from p to f  

after 3000 years in the Egyptian language we can suspect many such broad traces *combined* :  

D-DT-T  
T-TH-S-C  
D-DS-S (demi - semi)  
C-CH-CK-K  
D-DZ-DJ-DCH-CH  

combining two of these can lead to a Spektrum leading from K to D, which is not a usual sound change.  

asides from the ordinary sound changes and R-L in Egypt we find an affinity of  
NV  
NM  
MB  
MW  mit/with mo/wood  


Traces between (semi)vowels don't help  
W-U-OO-O-OA-A-AR W-R etc  

quickly all letters of the alphabet can be reached with just three or four consonants: M T P R  

Thus giving a sign the infamous sequence µPTR can lead to almost all words in the dictionary if we allowed substrings. µPTR=map.tr µPTR⋍pthr⋍prth⋍price …  pick any word.  

Thus one needs to be very careful avoiding this sequence or extending known words with 'just an extra m or r'.  

That's a dilemma because some words actually might have had such a sequence / cluster  
P-T-R father ...  
𓆑 PTHN? probably PTH ⇔ 'PSI' though  
CEPHAL (head) ⇔ KOPPER ⇔ CAPUT.ma  

For [𓆑](𓆑) at least the pain can be alleviated:  
Axiom 8: Most letters had a full (original) reading and an alphabetic one.  

𓏶 MAS/PRO/CEN  

fortunately these appear in quite **specific** sequences & contexts.  

In those cases one must be careful abusing the blurriness for words which probably have such sequence.
