Unlike the 'Ubaid' phenomenon which was polycentric and in which the association with the city of Ubaid is mostly a modern artifact, the later Uruk world system truly revolves around Uruk:  

The early Uruk was a **consumer** of by then higher advanced mountainous regions:

This picture changed: Already by the Middle Uruk period and continuing into the Late Uruk period, the heartland of the Uruk state expe- rienced an increase in population, with the number of settlements in the Uruk hinterland multiplying tenfold. In contrast to this, the number of settlements in the neighboring regions of northern Mesopotamia and the Susiana sharply decreased while coming under the influence of the Uruk culture.  

Notably the technological progress of Egypt is more closely linked to [Elam](Elam.html) than to Uruk, but it is a close match. Susa and more importantly by a factor of five Anshan and their hinterlands were relatively on eye level with Uruk.

The sacred quarter of Eridu, site of the main monumental structures of the Ubaid period in Lower Mesopotamia, is poorly known for the Uruk period though Uruk Period pottery was found there.
