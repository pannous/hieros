Nabataean No<a href="ambi">m</a>ad @ Nabatene: Arabian borderland that stretched from the Euphrates to the Red Sea.<br />
Assyrians listed a group with the name of "Nabatu" as one of several rebellious Arab tribes in the region (of Hejaz?)  A people called the "Nabaiti" who were defeated by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal and described as living "in a far off desert where there are no wild animals and not even the birds build their nests", had similar names and images, identified with the Nebaioth of the Hebrew Bible, the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham's son</p>
