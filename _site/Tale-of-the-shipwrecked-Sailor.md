Once you worked through the [sailor-excerpt](sailor-excerpt) you can enjoy the [whole text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pannous/hieros/master/texts/Sailor.translated.txt)  

We mostly follow the conventional alphabet yet yield vastly different texts from the standard, so if you want to learn Egyptian as it was done in the last century this is not your site. If however you want a *much* more approachable 'dialect' then you can't find a better site.  

you can always look up words in the official [dictionary](https://hieroglyph-keyboard.herokuapp.com/) (with inofficial comments, cognates and mnemonics)
