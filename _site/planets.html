<h1 id="outer-and-inner-planets">Outer and inner planets</h1>
<p>Overall, all three outer planets are linked to different forms of the falcon-headed god Horus, especially connected with royalty. Venus is linked with his father Osiris, and Mercury with Seth, the brother, enemy, and killer of Osiris, who killed him. Given also that the Sun and Moon are masculine in Egyptian conception, this means that the moving celestial bodies are conceived exclusively as male entities in Ancient Egypt, quite in contrast to many other ancient cultures.</p>

<p>The epithets of the planets do not contain anything that gives essential and permanent characteristics for any single planet; they would be possible for any of them at certain times. Rather, they are indications of actual stages at specific moments. For reasons which cannot exactly be explained, such a depiction with ephemeral captions became codified as the classical sky image in Egypt for a very long time.</p>

<h1 id="name-for-planet">name for "planet"</h1>
<p>The Egyptians had a strong tendency to differentiate clearly between Sun and Moon, on the one hand (often called “the two luminaries”), and the five planets, on the other. At least for the late (demotic) phase of the Egyptian language, the term the (five) living stars is clearly attested as a specific term for the planets. It is uncertain if living stars also specifically designates the planets in the older periods during which this expression is not yet attested with the specific number five.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it is difficult to pinpoint any Egyptian word for planet; they may simply have been subsumed under stars.</p>

<p>In one case, discs #jtn.w is perhaps used for the planets.</p>

<p>Another word, namely #tnm, attested once in the Pyramid Texts and a directly parallel Coffin Text spell, has also been understood as planet. This is mainly because, on the one hand, close to it in the text there is a mention of the fifth one, and, on the other hand, there is an option of translating the word as the errant one and thus bringing it into semantic similarity to the literal meaning of planet.</p>

<p>One word, #gnm.w, attested once in the Pyramid Texts, clearly designates some celestial entity; some scholars have understood it as planets, others as decans (a special group among the fixed stars), and yet others more neutrally and perhaps still too specifically as the moving ones.</p>

<h1 id="sdw-was-proposed-as-a-general-word-for-planets-but-the-evidence-is-circumstantial-at-best-briggs-based-his-proposal-entirely-on-the-fact-that-the-sdw-were-following-the-path-of-the-sun-but-that-would-fit-stars-close-to-the-ecliptic-as-well">sḥd.w was proposed as a general word for planets, but the evidence is circumstantial at best. Briggs based his proposal entirely on the fact that the sḥd.w were following the path of the Sun, but that would fit stars close to the ecliptic as well.</h1>

<h1 id="name-of-the-planets">name of the planets</h1>

<p>Venus is normally called either “the phoenix bird” or “the heron bird” and linked with the god Osiris. All these beings are also attested in other contexts. Only in the Late Period is the name “the morning star” applied to her with certainty (but see “Possible Attestations of Specific Planets in Other Contexts”). She receives the epithet “the crossing star.” ϫⲓⲛⲥⲓⲛⲓ ⲙⲁⲛⲥⲓⲛⲓ •ⲓⲛⲥⲓⲛⲓ ⋍ venucin ⇔ wankel schwank : Mercury</p>

<p>The names of some of the planets in the older texts are etymologically not transparent, or the orthographies of the different families show variations which indicate uncertainties about the exact origin of a compound form whose individual parts could be segmented in different ways. In addition to their proper names, the planets also receive epithets. It should be stressed that in several cases, these epithets are written down in a garbled form, especially concerning the word sequence, but sometimes also displaying confusion between hieroglyphs of vaguely similar shape. This is a good indication that the preserved monuments are often the product of mechanical copying from models more than a genuine understanding of the contents.</p>

<p>The name of Jupiter is especially problematic in its transmission. In the astronomical depictions making use of the main Senenmut family, probably also the Seti IC family, it is consistently written “Horus who bounds the two lands.” A subgroup of it, however (Senenmut subgroup B), writes “Horus, the mystery of the two lands.” The New Kingdom members of the Seti IA family write “Horus who illuminates the two lands.” Late hieroglyphic sources give a writing which is ambiguous and could be understood either as “Horus who opens the secret” or as “Horus who illuminates the land.” The Demotic writings mostly give forms which may mean “Horus the mystery,” but more likely are simply a phonetic rendering of a word which no longer had a transparent meaning in contemporary speech. In some cases, the name is even written non-etymologically as “Horus the merchant,” which sounds quite similar in actual pronunciation (Quack, 1994; Goebs, 1995). He receives the epithet, “the southern star of the sky.”</p>

<p>Much clearer is the name of Saturn, which in the fullest form is “Horus bull of the sky”; in the Late Period normally shortened to “Horus the bull.” He is called the “eastern,” or in some cases “western” star.</p>

<h1 id="order">Order</h1>
<p>The Order of the planets change in different periods</p>

<p>In the Late Period, probably under Mesopotamian influence, the sequence of the planets as well as their religious associations could change; at least one source links Saturn with the Sun god, Mars with Miysis, Mercury with Thot, Venus with Horus, son of Isis, and Jupiter with Amun, arranging the planets with those considered negative in astrology first, separated from the positive ones by the vacillating Mercury.</p>
