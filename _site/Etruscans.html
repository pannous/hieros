<p>Aeneas Sage tale: Virgil's Aeneid<br />
The Aeneid explains that Aeneas is one of the few Trojans who were not killed or enslaved when Troy fell.<br />
He was the progenitors of Romans.</p>

<p>This is corroborated by connections between <a href="Luwian">Luwian</a> and <a href="Etruscan">Etruscan</a></p>

<p>The phonology of Etruscan is known through the alternation of Greek and Etruscan letters in some inscriptions (for example, the Iguvine Tablets), and many individual words are known through loans into or from Greek and Latin, as well as explanations of Etruscan words by ancient authors. A few concepts of word formation have been formulated (see below). Modern knowledge of the language is incomplete.</p>

<p>Tages' recorded response is "in ancient letters", presumably in the Etruscan language. Lydus says it is not very understandable, and that he relies on translations.</p>

<p>Winged figures, representing divinity, are also common, especially on funerary urns from Tarquinia (CorNeto)<br />
there appears to be no standard way to depict Tages. Art historians have inserted Tages freely among them but entirely in a speculative fashion.</p>

Other scenes in which Vanth is present involve the meeting and escort of the dead, in the role of psychopompos, who are either walking or being transported on horseback, wagon, or chariot.</p>
