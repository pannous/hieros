a general question is whether diverging word stems appeared through a sound shift or a duplicated route.  
those duplicated roots were quite frequent in proto Indo European vocabulary:  
kwerkar (work = kar @ persia)  
[𓂜](𓂜) muno- (celtic for no¬ µo¬ negation)  
...  
[todo](todo)  

it is also possible that those duplicate roots were formed *after* the sound shift, in order to keep the system together, or to facilitate communication so that one party always understood one part of the word.
