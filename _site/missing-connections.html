<p>missing connections on wiktionary.org  see <a href="clusters.html">clusters</a></p>

<p>There is a gradient between words which <a href="Good-Linguistics">possibly should be connected</a> on wiktionary, but are left out because of doubt or insufficient research,<br />
and words which should be connected but are actively rejected because of <a href="bad-linguistics">dubious arguments</a> and "formal difficulties".</p>

<p>These formal difficulties include wrongly reconstructed roots.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="axioms.html">axioms</a> of revised language theory is:<br />
If words from the same language familie(s) look similar on the surface they are most likely connected, even if the reconstructions seem to be divergent on first examination.</p>

<p><a href="𓎛.html">𓎛</a> θρίξ 𒋠 šārtu شعر šaʿr שיער 𐎌𐎓𐎗𐎚 shair@Semitic hair her@Armenian <a href="𓎛.html">𓎛</a></p>

<p>The surface similarity between šarm and shame dictates that these should be connected:</p>

<p>شرم • šarm शर्म śarma 𐭱𐭥𐭬 (šarm) from Avestan 𐬟𐬱𐬀𐬭𐬆𐬨𐬀 fšarəma shame</p>

<p>While  شرم • šarm is correctly connected to 'harm', the connection to 'shame' is missing.</p>

<p>This <a href="cluster.html">cluster</a> can be reconciled with the following reconstruction:</p>

<p>shame &lt; •sharm &lt;⋍ scar.<a href="mak.html">mak</a><br />
Schande ⇔ Schaden scar.<a href="done.html">done</a> scar.<a href="do.html">do</a> &gt; hurt</p>

<p>Where scar is just one illustrative representative of the scar (ἐσχάρα) branch with similar sound in an anknown stage.</p>

<p>One of the <a href="axioms.html">axioms</a> of revised language theory is:</p>

<p>If words from language familie(s) with historic <a href="wanderwords">close contact</a> look similar on the surface they are most likely connected, if only through <a href="phono-semantic-matching.html">phono-semantic-matching</a>:</p>

<p>شرم • šarm სირცხვილი sircxvili 耻辱 chǐrǔ shame ( perhaps ;)</p>

<p>Even worse than obvious missing connections are those which were rejected later:<br />
mm, true!<br />
wiktionary says:</p>

<p>" сорокъ (sorokŭ, “a bunch of 40 sable pelts; forty”,<br />
Further etymology is unclear. In the past regarded as borrowed from Byzantine Greek σαράκοντα (sarákonta, “40”, but this etymology is dubious for phonetic and semantic reasons. The older meaning is a bunch of sable pelts. May be related to соро́чка (soróčka); compare Old Norse serkr “shirt; 200 furs”,</p>

<p>The problem here is asserting "The older meaning"</p>
