<p>Sanskrit ि fi was later misread and misaligned as the i-anomaly</p>

<p>example: दिवि ftivi =&gt; divi : sky</p>

<p>𓊪 𓏏 𓇯 𓀭 Ptah sky <a href="father.html">father</a> pater Petrus &gt; weather<br />
𓊪 𓏏 𓇯 𓀭 Ptah &gt; दिवि ftvi &gt; <a href="ि.html">ि</a> divi <a href="deus.html">deus</a> sky</p>

<p>Now this misreading is so hardcoded into the indian consciousness that is hard to imagine a time when ि was read as f.</p>
