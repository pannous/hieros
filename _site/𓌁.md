𓌁 electricity (from ēlectrum “amber”) was first known from [[catfish]] and rays (2750 BCE)  
Electric fish were again reported millennia later by ancient Greek, Roman and Arabic naturalists and physicians.  
Patients with ailments such as gout or headache were directed to touch electric fish in the hope that the powerful jolt might cure them. However complex objects such as the [Baghdad_Battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad_Battery) turned out NOT to be electric devices.  
Some sections of the Bible might indicate electric shocks, but no indication of volunteer controlled applications.  
Ancient cultures around the Mediterranean knew that certain objects, such as rods of amber, could be rubbed with cat's fur to attract light objects like feathers. Thales of Miletus made a series of observations on static electricity around 600 BCE, from which he believed that friction rendered amber magnetic, in contrast to minerals such as magnetite, which needed no rubbing. Electricity would remain little more than an intellectual curiosity for millennia until 1600 AD.
