<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_North_Eurasian">ANE</a> Ancient North Eurasian<br />
Domestication of the <a href="dog.html">dog</a> in Siberia?</p>

<p>"It has been suggested that their mythology may have included a narrative, found in both Indo-European and Native American fables, in which a dog guards the path to the afterlife."</p>

<p>Tarim Mummies surprisingly <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/western-china-s-mysterious-mummies-were-local-descendants-ice-age-ancestors">found</a> to be Holocene ANE relics with (near) zero influx of <a href="Oxus">BMAC</a> or <a href="Afanasievo.html">Afanasievo</a> ancestry!</p>

<p>ANE is "basal to modern day Europeans", deeply related to Paleolithic/Mesolithic hunter-gatherers in Europe, but not especially related to East Asians, and is suggested to have perhaps originated in Europe or Western Asia or the Eurasian Steppe of Central Asia.</p>

<p>Direct contradiction:</p>

<p>Bronze-age-steppe Yamnaya and Afanasevo cultures were found to have a noteworthy ANE component at ⋍50%. The ANE component was introduced to Western Europe by people related to the Yamnaya culture, long after the Paleolithic.[9][1] It is reported in modern-day Europeans (7%–25%), but not of Europeans before the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Populations genetically similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal%27ta%E2%80%93Buret%27_culture">Mal'ta</a> or Yana were an important genetic contributor to Native Americans, Europeans, Central Asians, South Asians, and some East Asian groups, in order of significance.</p>

<p>Eastern Hunter-Gatherer (EHG) is a lineage derived predominantly (75%) from ANE.[8] It is represented by two individuals from Karelia, one of Y-haplogroup R1a-M417, dated c. 8.4 kya, the other of Y-haplogroup J, dated c. 7.2 kya; and one individual from Samara, of Y-haplogroup R1b-P297, dated c. 7.6 kya.</p>

<p>Iran Neolithic (Iran_N) individuals dated ⋍8.5 kya carried 50% ANE-derived admixture and 50% Dzudzuana-related admixture,[14] marking them as different from other Near-Eastern and Anatolian Neolithics who didn't have ANE admixture.</p>

<p>Caucasian Hunter-Gatherer (CHG) is represented by the Satsurblia individual dated ⋍13 kya (from the Satsurblia cave in Georgia), and carried 36% ANE-derived admixture.[14] While the rest of their ancestry is derived from the Dzudzuana cave individual dated ⋍26 kya, which lacked ANE-admixture.</p>

<p>Ancestral Native American are specific archaeogenetic lineages, based on the genome of an infant found at the Upward Sun River site (dubbed USR1), dated to 11,500 years ago.[19] The AB lineage diverged from the Ancestral Native American (ANA) lineage about 20,000 years ago. (with later interbreeding, see <a href="paradoxon.html">paradoxon</a> )</p>

<p>Lake Baikal Holocene - Baikal Eneolithic (Baikal_EN) and Baikal Early Bronze Age (Baikal_EBA) derived 6.4% to 20.1% ancestry from ANE, while rest of their ancestry was derived from East Asians!</p>

<p>If there is one meta aspect one can learn from the <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/western-china-s-mysterious-mummies-were-local-descendants-ice-age-ancestors">recently found</a> 99% ANE component of the Tarim Mummies:<br />
They must have been culturally very open to new ideas yet very restricted ancestry wise. They full heartedly adopted the whole Bronze-age-package without any(?) signs of interbreeding!</p>
