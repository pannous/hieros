<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language">Proto-Indo-European</a> is the consensus Theory in which many of the commonly spoken languages in the world from English to Hindi derive from pioneering groups of 'settlers' who conquered the world with horses some ⋍5000 years ago.</p>

<p><a href="https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/lex/master">Lexicon</a></p>

<p>In pre-state societies, languages are thought to spread primarily through the movements of people.</p>

<p>After the last ice age the lineages of Eurasia, quite separately clustered at that time, entered an age of great genetic mixing.</p>

<p>The (most dominant) root of the PIE language likely formed when three people met and mixed north of the black sea:<br />
1. caucasian potters<br />
2. early european farmers and coppersmiths<br />
3. nordic shamans (EHG)</p>

<p>In this process PIE was formed by components of other proto languages:<br />
* <strong>semitic</strong> from the mesopotamian roots of agriculture (J1,J2)<br />
* maybe proto PIE from the <strong>megalithic</strong> societies spreading from Göbleki Tepe  (H,T,R)<br />
* picking up <strong>caucasian</strong> by the northern spread before 4000 BC  (G)<br />
* <strong>turk</strong> from the steppes  (Q,C)<br />
* <strong>uralic</strong> from the northern borders (I,N)</p>

<p>Here this theory is extended in that 'Proto-Indo-Europeans' did not stop at the gates of Sumeria and Egypt, but that they went straight through them. Either by forming the founding brotherhood of the international elite (which is depicted in Egyptian or Armana letters), or at the very least being in continuous strong contact with the ancient superpowers, leaving tremendous marks on all languages of Eurasia <a href="Highlights">and Egypt</a>.</p>

<p>Genetic studies revolutionize the fields of history and archaeology. While at the end of last century big migration theories (Völkerwanderungen) came largely out of vogue, thanks to modern DNA sequencing techniques, we now know that indeed Neolithic and Chalcolithic founding populations often almost completely replaced their Mesolithic anchestors. An interesting hotspot was around the Black Sea, where the last big replacement wave arose.</p>

Ancient Egyptians had little to no genetic kinship with sub-Saharan populations.<br />
Strikingly, the mummies were more closely related to ancient Europeans and Anatolians than to modern Egyptians. The mummies in the study were of middle-class people, not royalty. "There was no detectable change for those 1,800 years of Egyptian history," Krause said. "The big change happened between then and now."</p>

<p>There is a theory suggesting that before 2000 BC, Egyptians were of Caucasoid-European ethnicity. This is supported by the physical anthropology of the oldest mummies that have been found, the busts and statues of several pharaohs and their wives, the colored wall paintings discovered, and the descriptions provided in historical accounts.</p>

Famous DNA researcher David <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/03/ancient-dna-history/554798/?single_page=true">Reich</a> once had German collaborators drop out of a study when the findings seemed to mirror too closely Nazi propaganda about the Aryan race.</p>

<p>A queen of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiroft_culture">Jiroft</a> in Iran ⋍3000BC was 1.80 tall with red hair and a <a href="http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Iran_s_Burnt_City.htm">golden eye implant</a>.

<p>"DNA is doing its forcing the hand of this discussion in archaeology, showing that in fact, major movements of people do occur. They are sometimes sharp and dramatic, and they involve large-scale population replacements over a relatively short period of time."</p>

<!-- About 5,400 years ago, everything changed. All across Europe, thriving Neolithic settlements shrank or disappeared altogether. The dramatic decline has puzzled archaeologists for decades. “There’s less stuff, less material, less people, less sites,” Krause says. “Without some major event, it’s hard to explain.” But there’s no sign of mass conflict or war.  

 After a 500-year gap, the population seemed to grow again, but something was very different. In southeastern Europe, the villages and egalitarian cemeteries of the Neolithic were replaced by imposing grave mounds covering lone adult men. Farther north, from Russia to the Rhine, a new culture sprang up, called Corded Ware after its pottery, which was decorated by pressing string into wet clay.  

Corded Ware burials are so recognizable, archaeologists rarely need to bother with radiocarbon dating. Almost invariably, men were buried lying on their right side and women lying on their left, both with their legs curled up and their faces pointed south.  

women clutch purses and bags hung with canine teeth from dozens of dogs; men have stone battle-axes.  

Third wave: “It’s a change of burial customs around 2800 B.C.,” Mounds with reed mats and wood beams  

Like those Corded Ware skeletons, the Yamnaya shared distant kinship with Native Americans—whose ancestors hailed from farther east, in Siberia.  

 In what is now Germany, “there’s a 70 percent to possibly 100 percent replacement of the local farming population,” Reich says. “Something very dramatic happens 4,500 years ago.”  

just as smallpox and other diseases ravaged Native American populations, the plague, once introduced by the first Yamnaya, might have spread rapidly through crowded Neolithic villages.  

When construction of Stonehenge began about 3000 B.C., Britain was inhabited by Neolithic farmers. A millennium later, when it was finished, the Neolithic population had been replaced by descendants of the Yamnaya
