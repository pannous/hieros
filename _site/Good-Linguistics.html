<p># Good Linguistics</p>

<p>Linguists have good reason to be very cautious about putative etymologies: Some words exhibit such a complicated history that any '(un)educated guesses' or phonetic alignment would surely lead to completely wrong conclusions: Take the word lord&lt;lourde&lt;lowerd&lt;louerd,loverd,laford&lt;lhoaverd&lt;hlāford &lt; hlāfweard :  hlāf “bread” + weard “guardian” : loaf-warden if you will. Without historic background any etymology would certainly be misguided, the correct derivation impossible to guess.</p>

<p>There is a gradient between words which possibly should be connected on wiktionary, but are left out because of doubt and words which should be connected but are actively rejected because of dubious arguments and "formal difficulties".</p>

<p>Good Historians:</p>

<p>«The field is becoming much more open to the idea of using terms like "probably, likely, possibly"»</p>

<p>Good Linguists acknowledge, that similar to genetic admixture, creole languages inherit traits from both parent languages. Better Linguists acknowledge, that in fact most languages should be considered Creole languages forming a continuum between neighbours.</p>

<p>If words from the same language familie(s) look similar on the surface they are most likely connected, even if the reconstructions seem to be divergent on first examination.</p>

<p>Good-Linguists] treat these forms equivalently: crypt κρυπτή (kruptḗ), female form of the adjective κρυπτός (kruptós)</p>

<p>In the lack of contemporary old Proto-Germanic documents it's near impossible to say whether a term entered Germanic from Latin or the other way round.</p>

<h3 id="onomatopoeiaonomatopoeiahtml"><a href="onomatopoeia.html">onomatopoeia</a></h3>
<p>The question of onomatopoeia is near orthogonal to the question of relatedness: There are hundreds of plausibile sounds connected to entities. If the whole planet uses different sounds to describe an object and (as an example) two neigboring languages use “pop” there is a high chance that these two “pop” are related, onomatopoetic or not.</p>

<p>The balance between false (folk) etymologies on the one hand and false rejections on the other hand is extremely delicate. On elucidation of this eternal problem could be <a href="cluster-analysis.html">cluster-analysis</a> and unbiased alignment. Even though some connections may forever be unprovable, it doesn't harm to put two similar forms next to each other, if there is a probable historic cause to them being related or at least influenced after all.</p>

<p>Point in case:<br />
Linguistics spent decades extracting seemingly  different roots for English flow and Latin fluvio, Latin Theus and Greek Deus/Zeus. It's time for a new generation of Linguists to reconnect these different roots further down in the tree.</p>
