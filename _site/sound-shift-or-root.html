<p>a general question is whether diverging word stems appeared through a sound shift or a duplicated route.<br />
those duplicated roots were quite frequent in proto Indo European vocabulary:<br />
kwerkar (work = kar @ persia)<br />
<a href="ð“‚œ">ð“‚œ</a> muno- (celtic for noÂ¬ ÂµoÂ¬ negation)<br />
...<br />
<a href="todo">todo</a></p>

<p>it is also possible that those duplicate roots were formed <em>after</em> the sound shift, in order to keep the system together, or to facilitate communication so that one party always understood one part of the word.</p>
