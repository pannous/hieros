<p>Words of moral, in case someone wants to use this discovery to justify some new Arianism:</p>

<p>Human beings that need to proof of their superiority are not superior.<br />
necessary or not: The "Brotherhood of man"<a href="𓋊">𓋊</a>民門 started off very brutally, an international elite dominating not just animals, but also natives. Fortunately they interbred so much, that now most of the planet is indistinguishably related to the founding fathers. After 6000 years and &gt;200 generations it doesn't make much sense to ask about individual anchestry: One has 2²00 ⋍ 10e60 potential anchestors. If only Hitler knew some basic Math, his Arian theory would fall apart.</p>

<p>Every one of us is the child of a myriad of suppressors and suppressed likewise.<br />
Every one of us is the child of a myriad of individuals who were victorious in finding a partner and successfully bearing (and rising) children.<br />
Every brain of us is filled with the fruits of a myriad who were victorious in refining ideas.</p>
