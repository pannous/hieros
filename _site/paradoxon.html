<p># Main paradoxon of archaeogenetics:</p>

<h2 id="after-a-couple-of-millenia-every-human-is-related">After a couple of millenia, every human is related.</h2>

<p><strong>Proof</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Every person has two biological parents</li>
  <li>All parents had two parents</li>
  <li>The average age of mothers at birth was ⋍20-33 years</li>
  <li>Each century yields about 3-5 generations</li>
  <li>There are 20 centuries since Caesear</li>
  <li>Therefore there are ⋍ 60-80 generations since 0BC</li>
  <li>Therefore you have roughly 2 to the 60-80 combinatorial anchestors going back two millenia ⋍ 10²⁴</li>
  <li>The "total number of people who have ever lived" is in the order of 100 billion ⋍ 10^11</li>
  <li>Therefore to come to 10²⁴ combinatorial anchestors, the vast mayority of parents need to appear in several paths</li>
</ul>

<p>If nothing else, this should give a sense of how incredibly dense the forest (network!) of anchestry becomes after two millenia. Going back 2000 years one has about as many anchestors as there are <a href="https://www.why.is/svar.php?id=4803">grains of sand in the Sahara</a>.</p>

<h2 id="europe">Europe</h2>

<p>"Every one is a descendent of Charlemagne"</p>

<p>The argument has been made for the whole of Europe by <a href="https://www.sarahwoodbury.com/were-all-descended-from-charlemagne-and-related-to-each-other/">others</a> in <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001555">more detail</a></p>

<p>The specific choice of Charlemagne is a bit misleading since it may suggest that his high procreativity leads to the property of all-relatedness, which is entirely false: Any reproduction rate bigger than zero (which does not fizzle out) leads to this property: If after some generations one member of and inbreeding small community mates with an outsider, all offspring naturally inhabit the larger anchestry tree of the outsider; and so on.</p>

<p>"By 1,000 years ago everyone (who left descendants) would be an ancestor of every present-day European."<br />
This is the <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001555">correct way</a> of phrasing the above observations.</p>

<h3 id="india-and-china">India and China</h3>
<p>In order to spread the all-relatedness property to remote places, it suffices to note that this utterly comprehensive gene-flow can jump from one population / gene-pool to another with a <strong>single newcomer</strong> / outsider <strong>halfway</strong>. So if by 1000AD "Every single 'native' human in Europe was related to Caesar", then one of these Europeans traveling to China/India/America (and breeding) set off the same chain reaction: This newcomer acts as the new local Caesear. In practice there were already many Caesears in India/China before 1000AD and certainly many travelers after.</p>

<h3 id="america">America</h3>
<p>For the numbers to be large enough to spread all over America, the 500 years since Columbus might be a bit terse (this is an excercise), however if one accepts the likelyhood of one <strong>single outsider</strong> reaching America around 1000BC, the argument is obvious. (Lost sailor/ undocumented Chinese / Viking expedition etc).</p>

<h3 id="sentinel-islands">Sentinel Islands</h3>
<p>Let us investigate the most remote places on earth:<br />
For smaller populations like the Sentinel Islands, Pygmys, Amazons, New Zealand etc one doesn't need to assume early newcomers but a relatively recent outsider interbreding suffices (this is an excercise)</p>

<p>Note if you are only interested in the outmost branches of the paths the same estimates hold because<br />
* 2^n = 1+∑2^i for (i&lt;n) (16=1+8+4+2+1)</p>

<p>It is a paradoxon because<br />
1. It is beyound what most people believe<br />
3. It may be ill-formulated because with low probability there could be a handful (1000?) exceptions<br />
2. It is entirely plausible (unless you find a fundamental flaw in reasoning)<br />
3. Thus it is entirely debatable (and thank god there are fewer cocktail parties these days)</p>

<h2 id="objections">Objections</h2>
<p>a) People in some communities may mostly marry first cousins.<br />
Response: As long as one individual per epoche breeds with an outsider, the continent argument from above applies.</p>

<p>Follow up questions:<br />
Does this make the whole concept of <a href="races.html">races</a> irrelevant?<br />
Yes and no: male y-chromosome lineages are a read thread, even if the whole genome contribution might be 1/10²⁴<br />
Modern concepts of races should be more like a flux balance of clusters in PCA charts.</p>

<p>parents-without-a-trace-paradoxon: With 10²⁴ combinatorial anchestors, some of them might not have left a single base pair in your DNA, which has only about 6,2 × 10^9 base pairs.</p>

<h3 id="caesar-paradoxon">caesar-paradoxon</h3>

<p>Every living human is related to Caesar  (implicit assumtion: successful leaders are very likely to procreate)</p>

<p>Every living human is related to all Australian aborigines living 2000 years ago.</p>

«Does data support the hypothesis that species don’t just separate, they also merge? The answer is a resounding yes.»<br />
«that process of splitting up and merging back together again, and getting a bit of DNA from here to there, that’s happening all the time, in all of the tree of life»<br />
‘Different pieces of DNA have different gene trees, and you just can’t represent all of that in a single diagram.’</p>

<p>5% - 8% of human genome appears to be from [retro]virus inserts. Thats outside the tree of descent.</p>
