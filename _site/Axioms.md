General historical axioms  

* Egypt played a dominant role in an international power-network for over 2000 years  
* The Egyptian culture has strong connections to Semitic, European and African cultures  
* The Egyptian language has strong connections to Semitic, European and African languages  
* The Egyptian language(s) continued to influence other languages from 3500BC to 500AD  
* The (Proto)-Indo-European languages continued to influence other languages from 4000BC  
* The role of [PIE](PIE) in Mesopotamia and Egypt has to be rethought  
* *Independent* innovations are very rare / unlikely :  
* If a technology appears almost simultaneously in two different locations, it has one source  

# DO NOT BREAK WORDS INTO components! Examples: [Lapis](Lapis.html) [chariot](chariot.html)

Linguistic axioms  
* There is a high (but not perfect) correlation between languages and genes  
* Paleogenetic and modern data will yield hints towards language developments.  
* The 'tree' metaphor for languages is inadequate and should be replaced with modern 'flow' theories.  
* There are different kinds of relatedness, all denoted by '[>](>.html)' here  
* The exact nature of [relatedness](relatedness.html) between Egyptian words and modern reflections is (almost) never certain.  
* If words from the same language family look similar on the surface they are most likely related:  
*   even if the reconstructions seem to be divergent on first examination.  
* If words from language families with historic close contact look similar on the surface they are likely [connected](relatedness)  
*   if only through [phono-semantic-matching](phono-semantic-matching.html)  
* enforcement: if a native community has several synonyms, foreign communities influence and repeatedly select the word which has the closest perceived relative in their native language. sheriff (shire + reeve) ⇔ sharif Might be an example  
* [opposites](opposites.html) are often related, because in a orthogonal semantic dimension they are identical ([guest](guest.html)⇔host …)  
* many things can be understood just using the [Alphabet](Alphabet)  
*  words connected with those letters were hyper conserved (changed very little)  
* words connected with the alphabet formed conserving, re-converging clusters  
* words connected with those signs underwent [alphabetic-change](alphabetic-change.html)  
* For many [Gardinger signs](Gardinger-signs) we use some different readings, based on the corpus and rules of [determinant](determinant.html)s  
* The phonetic readings reconstructed are an echo of a more complicated history  
* By its very nature the pronunciation can always only be a cluster approximation  
* Any 'precise' vocalisation of Egyptian is complete speculation and bears no authority.  
* Any linguistic method or argument relying precise vocalisation is invalid  
* Large scale comparisons and [cluster analysis](cluster analysis.html) akin to universal [sound-change](sound-change.html) are valid  
* Connecting individual words outside [Coptic](Coptic.html) remains thus forever tentative  
* On the other hand tentatively [connecting](relatedness) individual words outside [Coptic](Coptic.html) cannot be dismissed via 'formal arguments' but should be subject to historic plausibility.  
* Most [Gardinger signs](Gardinger-signs) assumed to be silent receive a pronounciation.  
* [Determinants](Determinants) often had a vocalisation which was optional: akin to New York (city).  
* Puns and the rebus principle lead to wrong etymologies  
* This kind of wrong etymology is a true etymology in the sense of [influence](relatedness)  
* Confusion of signs lead to wrong readings  
* After centuries of consistent wrong readings, they become true, if adapted by the populous  
* Ambivalent readings can be both correct  
* The ultimate reading of some gardener signs is not fully determined  
* Once a European connection is accepted, European suggestions are allowed Pyr⇔Fire [𓍑](𓍑)  
* Most letters had a full (original) reading and an alphabetic one  
* The vowels where mostly lost, the consonants blurred out 𓏏 Delle=tell 𓏏𓏏 dad=tit 𓏏 dough=Teig  
* Some signs had different associated entities  
* All *phonetic* readings should be understood as instantiations of binomial cluster distributions  
* Combinging these distributions can lead to a [wildcard fallacy](wildcard fallacy.html)] {one sign generating all}  
* In two related languages if two words sound similar they are *probably* related somehow  
* The alignment of one word alone is rarely evidence enough  
* The alignment of whole [clusters](mutual-evidence) of words can be prove  
* Deus, Theus and Zeus are related period. Anyone who thinks differently must stop reading  
* The Egyptian language and [Grammar](Grammar) is rather simple.  
* Over the course of three millenia, most universal [sound changes](sound changes.html) did occur  
* Many signs exhibited a quantum state: the reading would flip with the context. Two completly different but harmonious readings might have occasionally occured.  
* After the last dynasty the Egyptian system was already riddled with ambiguities, corruption, confusion and dialectic readings, not just in the modern meaning but truely literally dialectic (see [Sumerian](Sumerian.html) signs).  

The reconstructed [Alphabet](Alphabet.html) is the most crucial part of Egyptology  
We mostly follow the [conventional reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_of_Ancient_Egyptian#Table_of_transliteration_schemes) of the letters  
With some minor shifts and with the exception of  
'v' letters:  [𓇋](𓇋) as fE, 𓍢𓅱 as wə with dangling 'on', [𓆑](𓆑) as vhe or [φhethn](wildcard-fallacy)
