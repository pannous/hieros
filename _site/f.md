F 𓇋 f 𓆑 ƒ [𓆑](𓆑) python 𒁁𒋻 pattar feather [𓇋](𓇋)  

𐎔 PU 𒉺 pa 𐘂 PA 𐀞 pa male  

The letters representing ‘f’ were prone to corruption, and have caused much scholarly confusion and frustration for various reasons:  

It was lost in translation in languages which don’t posses the phonological equivalent of f.  
It is similar to f ⋍ v ⋍ wh ⋍ ph and other variants in other languages, some pronunciations unfamiliar to English.  

Especially [𓆑](𓆑) was also associated with forbidden taboos and temporarily erased from hieroglyph inscriptions.  
In demotic times scribes went wild in the character.  

One clear shift in the reading of the [Sanskrit](Sanskrit) Alphabet is the dangling i which was originally just an ordinary fi and its inverse which was a similar fi  

ordinary [f](f)i : पि ﬀi  

Both पि And पी should be transcribed as fi and fi, namely fphi and phfi or fi+p and p+fi,  
similar to the ph in physics or German Pferd.  

There was a global shift from va to a in all alphabets:  

Latin atta, Ancient Greek ἄττα (átta), Gothic 𐌰𐍄𐍄𐌰 (atta), Old Church Slavonic отьць (otĭcĭ).  

[𓇋](𓇋.html)[𓏏](𓏏.html)[𓆑](𓆑.html) father (not : attav)  

It is not that 𐌰𐍄𐍄𐌰 was orignially pronounced 'atta', it is that the strange orthographic convention  
alpha = al'PHA ⋍ V at beginning of words was lost/discarded!  

One needs to be careful reading old scripts in similar alphabets with our modern pronounciation!  
Other orthographic conventions / lost components were gg⋍ng [i](i.html)<r [epsilon](epsilon.html)<s aa⋍va/ma  

NO SUCH CUNEIFORM
