<p>Botai population turned out to be closer to the Ancient North Eurasian component than the Yamnaya population. No significant gene flow between Botai and Yamnaya was observed.[9]</p>

<p>Botai 14 has a calibrated radiocarbon date range from 3108–3517 cal BC, and Botai 15 from 3026–3343 cal BC. Regarding Y-DNA, Botai 14 was determined to carry a derived allele at R1b1a1-M478 (that occurs almost exclusively in non-European populations, and reaches the highest frequencies in populations surrounding the Altai region, the common ancestor with major European R1b lived somewhat more than 13 000 years ago[10]), and Botai 15 belonged to the basal haplogroup N*-M231.</p>
