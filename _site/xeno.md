xenotic sound or syllables are those unfamiliar to 'our' modern ears and  tongues:  

The word xeno itself probably contained an exotic xenotic sound  

[𓍲](𓍲.html)  

when confronted with such a sound we often find approximations which may or may not be very similar or different resulting in divergence of wanderwords  
Beijing Peking ...  

what is familiar to our ears  might be strange to other, for example there are languages without clear p,b,f distinctions and without consonant clusters kr,pr,spr,str,...  

Before and during the neolithic revolution, the eurasian language landscape was probably littered with all kinds of strange vocal articulations; as can still be  witnessed in [caucasian](caucasian.html) tongues  

other consonant clusters are so ubiquitous that they should deserve a character of their own: tsh,dj,...  

In retrospect it is often unclear whether there was a complicated sound or just a cluster of consonants which fused: see the peculiar [qp](qp.html)/[qv](qv.html) clusters  

it is also possible that to a completely unrelated words were fused by neighboring countries resulting in orthographic peculiarities and [ambi](ambi.html)guous signs.  

Some sounds are not  truly  complicated but just sit in the middle between two familiar sounds:  
greek semi < [δ](δ.html)[ε](ε.html)μη⋍dsemi > demi  

of these foreign sounds result in [sound change](sound change.html)s and ultimately the disappearance and appreciation into vowels
