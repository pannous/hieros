<p># onomatopoeia</p>

<p>The question of onomatopoeia is near orthogonal to the question of relatedness:</p>

<p>scratch is clearly onomatopoetic, yet it clearly belongs to the strong PIE root *(s)ker “to cut” ⇔ scrape <a href="script.html">script</a> …</p>

<p>There are hundreds of plausibile sounds connected to entities. If the whole planet uses different sounds to describe an object and (as an example) two neigboring languages use “pop” there is a high chance that these two “pop” are related, onomatopoetic or not.</p>

<p>In general the author ascribes low relevance to onomatopoeia when multiple onomatopoeial forms exist and similar forms are locally clustered<br />
However in case of bird names 𓅚 𓅙 and other animals, special care is appropriate</p>

<p>quieck pig poink ⇔ pink<br />
quack duck?<br />
wolf (whoul.<a href="fair">fair</a>)</p>
