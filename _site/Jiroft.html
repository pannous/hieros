<p>Covering an area of 151 hectares, Shahr-e Sukhteh was one of the worldâ€™s largest cities at the dawn of the urban era. In the western part of the site is a vast graveyard, measuring 25 ha. It contains between 25,000 and 40,000 ancient graves.</p>

<p>Over 130 to 900 satellite sites and villages in the Sistan Plain are connected to Shahr-e Sukhteh, the burned city of Baluchestan</p>

<p>In December 2006, archaeologists examining Shahr-e Sukhteh discovered the world's earliest known artificial eyeball.[17] It has a hemispherical form and a diameter of just over 2.5 cm (1 inch). It consists of very light material, probably bitumen paste. The surface of the artificial eye is covered with a thin layer of gold, engraved with a central circle (representing the iris) and gold lines patterned like sun rays. The female whose remains were found with the artificial eye was <strong>1.82 m tall (6 feet)</strong>, much taller than ordinary women of her time. On both sides of the eye are drilled tiny holes, through which a golden thread could hold the eyeball in place. Since microscopic research has shown that the eye socket showed clear imprints of the golden thread, the eyeball must have been worn during her lifetime. The woman's skeleton has been dated to between 2900 and 2800 BCE.</p>
