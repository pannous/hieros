The role played by Susa, in southwestern Iran, is an intriguing one in the history of early writing; 184 documents are known from this site, all dated to the Uruk V phase or earlier. The first cylinder sealings on clay bullae are attested in Susa by the Middle Uruk period, far earlier than in Uruk itself.
