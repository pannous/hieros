[5.3] The Thracians are the most populous nation in the world, except the Indians.  
The Thracians bear many names in the different regions of their country, but all of them have like usages in every respect.  

      Herodotes Terpsichore (book 5 paragraph 3 page 410)  

The **Getae** and **[Sakae](Sakae.html)** and variants seem to be the biggest subgroups / most frequently used ethnonyms.  

[Herodotes](Herodotes.html)  

**Geten** und **Trauser** sind die wichtigsten Stämme dieses Volkes, deren Philosophen sich einzig den Griechen messen können.

We postulate that [KUR](KUR.html)[TAN](TAN.html) KUR[KAN](KAN.html) KUR[MAN](MAN.html) was a prominent [PIE](PIE.html) ethnonym and all the following ethnics are an echo of this [ethnonym](ethnonym.html) and are related in the sense that they all belonged to the Indo-Germanic / Indo-Arian branch of our [PIE](PIE):

Herodotus recorded that Carians themselves believed to be aborigines of Caria but they were also, by general consensus of ancient sources, a maritime people before being gradually pushed inland.[5] Plutarch mentions the Carians as being referred to as "cocks" by the Persians on account of their wearing crests on their helmets;  

Notably Most of them have origins in the mountainous regions around [Sumer](Sumer.html).  

Several [Kassite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kassites) leaders may have borne Indo-European names, and they may have had an Indo-European elite similar to the Mitanni

"Die **Thraker** sind nach den Indern das größte Volk"  
      Herodotes Terpsichore (5. book 3. paragraph page 410)  

Thraker may refer to other northernes: Troyka TarTars Druids ...  
'Turks' might have been more of a toponym than a ethnonym, just like not all Indi are Hindi (but most).  
The Homeland of the Thracians was relatively clearly defined: Europe and the northern steppes (up to Tocharia?).  

Being a very 'philosophic' people and in possession of chariots, we can infer that they must have been much more culturally advanced than commonly depicted. Interestingly the German wiki gives a very different first impression

The above image reveals one important ethnic marker: The smurf-hat which can be traced via the [Oxus](Oxus) to the [Xia](Xia) dynasty, similar in shape to the white crown 𓋑  

The borders of this people are depicted much too small on wikipedia, given that they were almost as populous as the Hindi and the density of their cities can't have been much higher than say the Persians'.  
There might be other markers, if we can trust Herodotes and Egyptian depictions of [race](race)s: Tatoos, body height, often red/blond hair, chariots, birds on ships, kurgans, and others.  

Herodotus calls the Geti of Muntenia, Moldavia and the North of Bulgaria as well as the Dacians of the Carpathian Mountains "the bravest and the justest of all the Thracian tribes."  

Several scholars, especially in the Romanian historiography, posit the identity between the Getae and their westward neighbours, the [Dacians](Dacians). Dutch ⋍ Deutsche ⋍ Gothen ⋍ Getae.  

Customs of the Getae 500BC:  
They consider themselves ἀθανατίζοντες 'unsterblich'.

Once a continental identity, the Goths later became the name of a very specific ethnic, just like the Dutch are specific even though in the big picture they belong to the much bigger *tewtéh₂ Teutonic branch (legendary Titans?):  

The Geats (/ˈɡiːts/, /ˈɡeɪəts/ or /ˈjæts/)[1][2] (Old English: gēatas [ˈjæɑtɑs]; Old Norse: gautar [ˈɡɑu̯tɑr]; Swedish: götar [ˈjøːtar]), sometimes called Goths,[3] were a North Germanic tribe who inhabited Götaland ("land of the Geats")

[Sesostris](Sesostris.html) passed over to Europe from Asia and subdued the Scythians and also the Thracians.  

[4.11] There is also another different story, now to be related, in which I am more inclined to put faith than in any other. It is that the wandering Scythians once dwelt in Asia, and there warred with the Massagetae. For the land which is now inhabited by the Scyths was formerly the country of the Cimmerians.  Scythia still retains traces of the Cimmerians; there are Cimmerian castles, and a Cimmerian ferry, also a tract called Cimmeria. It appears likewise that the Cimmerians, when they fled into Asia to escape the Scyths… The Scyths, it is plain, pursued them, and missing their road, poured into Media.  For the Cimmerians kept the line which led along the sea-shore, but the Scyths in their pursuit held the Caucasus upon their right, thus proceeding inland, and falling upon Media. This account is one which is common both to Greeks and barbarians.  

… still further, the gold-guarding griffins; and beyond these, the Hyperboreans, who extended to the sea. (griffins = common eagle icon!)  

As the extent of Scythia is very great, … Above, to the northward of the farthest dwellers in Scythia, the country is said to be concealed from sight and made impassable by reason of the feathers which are shed abroad abundantly. The earth and air are alike full of them, and this it is which prevents the eye from obtaining any view of the region. … near Gades …  some say that the Ocean begins in the east, and runs the whole way round the world  

Assuming a Skandinavian origin for the Goths is like assuming the origin of Indians in Hyderabad.  

[5.7] The gods which they worship are but three, Mars, Bacchus, and Dian. Their kings, however, unlike the rest of the citizens, worship Mercury more than any other god, always swearing by his name, and declaring that they are themselves sprung from him.  

[5.8] Their wealthy ones are buried in the following fashion. The body is laid out for three days; and during this time they kill victims of all kinds, and feast upon them, after first bewailing the departed. Then they either burn the body or else bury it in the ground. Lastly, they raise a mound over the grave, and hold games of all sorts, wherein the single combat is awarded the highest prize. Such is the mode of burial among the Thracians.
