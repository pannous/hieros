<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samara_culture">Samara culture</a> (â‰ <a href="swastica">Samarra</a>) was a central advanced culture connecting Europe with Asia, bringing pottery and adopting the copper of the eneolithic as early as 5000 BC, oddly enclosed by still mesolithic cultures like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dnieper%E2%80%93Donets_culture">Dnieper culture</a>! Egg shaped beakers with sun motive! animal sacrifice,   no indisputable evidence of riding, but there were horse burials, the earliest in the Old World.</p>

<p>Typically the head and hooves of cattle, sheep, and horses are placed in shallow bowls over the human grave, smothered with ochre.</p>

<p>We know that the Indo-Europeans sacrificed both animals and people, like many other cultures (later).</p>

<p>The graves found are shallow pits for single individuals, but two or three individuals might be placed there.</p>

<p>A male buried at Lebyazhinka approximately 7,000 years BP and often referred to by scholars of archaeogenetics as the "Samara hunter-gatherer" (a.k.a. I0124; SVP44; M340431), appears to have carried the rare Y-DNA haplogroup R1b1* (R-L278*).[5]</p>

<p>Some of the graves are covered with a stone cairn or a low earthen mound, the very first predecessor of the <a href="kurgan.html">kurgan</a>.</p>

<p>Grave offerings included ornaments depicting horses. The graves also had an overburden of horse remains. Most controversial are bone plaques of horses or double oxen heads, which were pierced.</p>

<p>The graves yield well-made daggers of flint and bone, placed at the arm or head of the deceased, one in the grave of a small boy. Weapons in the graves of children are common later. Other weapons are bone spearheads and flint arrowheads.</p>

<p>A November 2015 study published in Nature included an analysis of a male hunter-gatherer from Lebyanzhinka, Samara Oblast who lived ca. 5650-5540 BC. He was found to be carrying haplogroup R1b1a1a and U5a1d.</p>
