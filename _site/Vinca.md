After neolithic settlers conquered Europe via Anatolia about 6500BC, something special happened in the Danube region: To the Neolithic technology stack of [Göbekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) and Jericho and [Çatalhöyük](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk), cast copper technology and proto-writing were added or developed by [Vinca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture) and related cultures, which set of a whole new level of [urbanisation](Home).  

It is quite possible that Vinca proto-writing and all subsequent systems were inspired by pottery symbols from China. The invention of pottery in east Asia ⋍20000 years ago reached the Near East an Europe very late in pre-history: Only about 7500 BC via the Don river! Or it was part of the paleolithic tool box:  

Japanese Jomon pottery (dated back to 13,000 years ago) and Middle Nile Egyptian vessels (from about 10,000 years ago) used open firing techniques.  


First proto-writing in western Eurasia:

Interestingly much of this «infant civilisation» has been replaced some centuries later by their 70% technology-only-descendants from [Varna](Varna.html), [Yamnaya](Yamnaya.html) and [Maykop](Maykop.html) as evidenced by their R1b genes, replacing much of the ancient G2 gene pool.  

Only 2000 years later do symbols of equal complexity reappear [synchronously](Home) in Sumeria and Egypt, possibly transmitted through the [Maykop](Maykop) culture. Such a persistence in time and space of a tradition or idea Is Not Unusual in history. It is most likely that the system lived on on perishable materials and those bark/textile *receipts* were just never hammered into stone until 3000BC.  

The only proto-writing symbols that are older than the Vinca symbols are

However these symbols, which may go back to pan-Russian shamanism and cave painting, are less sophisticated then the Vinca symbols.  
True writing in [China](china) appears much later, about 1200BC, in a very advanced form, most likely via the [Andronovo](Andronovo) or [Oxus](Oxus)/BMAC cultures. See the [Anau seal](China) as a central piece of evidence.
