This hieroglyph depicts one form of something called a water-clock or Clepsydra/Hydrologia, which was used to tell the time by the drainage of water through a small hole.

The item was associated with Thoth due to its use as a measuring tool, and thus miniature versions or models made of faience often had baboons incorporated into their structure. It is said by Horapollo in Hieroglyphica that it was traditional to allow water to drain out of a hole in the baboon's genitalia because the baboon apparently cries and urinates 12 times a day on the equinoxes. Regardless of the exact reason, the hole was indeed sometimes placed at the end of the baboon's penis. Model, non-functional versions of the water-clock often mimicked the shape of the hieroglyph itself, similar to the Ma'at-figurine, and may have been used in offering rituals.

The Clepsydra represented ordered passage of time and was one of the offerings given by Thoth to the Wandering Goddess to make her come home. Hence it is often seen in offering scenes to lioness goddesses.

It was known in Egyptian as šbt ('Shebet'), and the hieroglyph 𓃼 has that ideogrammatic value, as well as being a determinative for the word.
