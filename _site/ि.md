Sanskrit ि fi was later misread and misaligned as the i-anomaly  

example: दिवि ftivi => divi : sky  


𓊪 𓏏 𓇯 𓀭 Ptah sky [father](father.html) pater Petrus > weather  
𓊪 𓏏 𓇯 𓀭 Ptah > दिवि ftvi > [ि](ि.html) divi [deus](deus.html) sky  

Now this misreading is so hardcoded into the indian consciousness that is hard to imagine a time when ि was read as f.
