𒀭𒐏𒋰𒁀 Nimintabba (DNimin-tab-ba, previously read Dimtabba) was a Goddess of Sumer.[4]She is thought to have been a local deity of the city of Ur, as her only known temple was located there. Her worship was particularly associated with king Shulgi (reigned c. 2094 – c. 2046 BC), and there are no previous attestations of her.
