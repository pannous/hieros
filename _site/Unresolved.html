<p>Many words in the dictionary are not yet fully understood, some of them never will be:<br />
If you encounter an obscure text in a specific medical magical document, chances are that this word and its connotions are forever lost to history.</p>

clever, ⋍gewand, buBend</p>

<p>quadruple   𓇋  𓆑   𓂧  𓂢  𓏥<br />
qVdt𓂢?<br />
1) qV ? maybe already split from early PIE ⇨ fftd 4-drieren ohne q!?<br />
2) 𓂢 Endung? -don -tion -ate -ieren ok but normally different suffix<br />
other PIE endings:<br />
čtyřná.sobný<br />
čtyřná.sobek<br />
četvero.struk<br />
vier.fach vier.mal<br />
cvaug.vunai<br />
none of which seems that any similarity to the symbol 𓂢<br />
