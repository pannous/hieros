<p><a href="Wanderwords.html">Wanderwords</a> which are adopted phonetically but reinterpreted beyond <a href="reanalysis.html">reanalysis</a> undergo so called Phono-semantic matching: e.g.</p>

<p>WWW World Wide Web, which is wàn wéi wǎng (万维网), which satisfies "www" and literally means “myriad dimensional net”<br />
hacker has been borrowed into Mandarin as 黑客 (hēikè, "wicked visitor" (black guest))<br />
声纳 shēngnà "sonar", which uses the characters 声 shēng "sound" and 纳 nà "nehme, receive, accept"</p>

<p>Chinese has a large number of homo/heterotonal homophonous morphemes, which would have been much better phonetic fit in sonar, but not nearly as good semantically: song (cf. 送 sòng ‘deliver, carry, give (as a present)’, 松 sōng ‘pine; loose, slack’, 耸 sǒng ‘tower; alarm, attract’ etc.), sou (cf. 搜 sōu ‘search’, 叟 sŏu ‘old man’, 馊 sōu ‘sour, spoiled’ and many others) or shou (cf. 收 shōu ‘receive, accept’, 受 shòu ‘receive, accept’, 手 shǒu ‘hand’, 首 shǒu ‘head’, 兽 shòu ‘beast’, 瘦 shòu ‘thin’ and so forth)."[9]<br />
搜纳 sōunà and 耸纳 shounà would be ok!</p>

<p>白俄罗斯 Bái'èluósī, "Belarus" combines the word 白 Bái, "White" with the name俄罗斯 Èluósī, "Russia", therefore meaning "White Russia" just like the endonym "Белару́сь".  DEEP!</p>

<p>倶楽部 (kurabu) for "club", where the characters can be interpreted loosely in sequence as "together", "fun" and "place".</p>

<p>合羽 (kappa) for the Portuguese capa, a kind of raincoat. The characters can mean "wings coming together", as the pointed capa resembles a bird with wings folded together.</p>

<p>Natural association of turtle with 𒊺 scales, but 𒈜 is clearly secondary phonetic</p>

<h1 id="forced-associations">forced associations</h1>
<p>in times when syllabic signs and the letters of the alphabet where not abstract but defined through their ( <a href="rebus.html">rebus</a> ) root, naturally all words using those signs became strongly associated. This was sometimes alleviated through <a href="complement.html">complement</a> orthograpyh.</p>

<h1 id="desired-ambivalence">desired ambivalence</h1>

<p>One strong feature of symbolic and even spoken languages per se is that parts can be associated in myriad ways, children do this conciously and unconciously and have to unlearn those associations which are not supported by their environment.</p>

<p>Poets can often make use of such associations and in the beginnings the <strong>rebus</strong> principle was even the biggest enabler of written language. Puns were often indistinguishable from expressive necessity.</p>

<p># subunit matching</p>

<p>Acronym readings are an extreme form of PSM and can yield almost anything, any connection in any language.<br />
This is why in the analysis of words in the dictionary corpus, splitting long sequences of signs into short meaning-lets instantly yields absurd connections at the scholars volition. Most of them likely wrong. Under all circumstances must a most exhaustive matching be preferred to a subunit matching. Prime example being</p>

Even though splitting the word into components (lion-hunter / horse-car) might be completly reasonable,<br />
the best etymology is no etymology at all:<br />
𓅓 𓂝 𓃭 𓏤 𓎡 𓄿 𓃀 𓏲 𓍘 𓇋 𓆱 | horse chariot | 𐎎𐎗𐎋𐎁𐎚 mrkbt /markabtu/</p>

<p>Icelandic  DANGER: PIE!</p>

<p>eyðni, meaning "AIDS", is a PSM of the English acronym AIDS, using the pre-existent Icelandic verb eyða, meaning "to destroy"</p>

<p>tækni, meaning "technology, technique", derives from tæki, meaning "tool", combined with the nominal suffix -ni, but is, in fact, a PSM of the Danish (or international) teknik, meaning "technology, technique"    TRUE neo-COGNATE! (re-) =&gt;</p>

<p>tæknilegur "technical" and tæknir "technician"</p>

<p>okul école 'school' lat: schola (cf. the original Turkish coinage okula(ğ) ⇔ oculus: eye<br />
co-etymon of okul is Turkish oku- '(to) read', cf. okumak 'to read, study', okuma 'reading', okur 'reader'. Note the semantic affinity with Arabic كتب kataba 'wrote (masculine, singular)', the ultimate origin of Ottoman Turkish mektep.</p>

<p>synchronically, Turkish okul cannot be regarded as öztürkçe (pure Turkish) since the final -l is not a Turkish suffix and was imported ad hoc from French.</p>
