The [Latvian](Latvian) languages are renowned among linguists for preserving some features of [PIE](PIE) especially well.  

Some forms of Egyptian also seem closer to [Latvian](Latvian) than other languages:  

𓋴 𓐍 𓏏 𓏮 𓂻||run|skriet@LAT+++ spurt/scourt/escort courant scout (courier) ⇔ Schritte𓂻  

while the word beard '𓐍𓃀𓊃𓅱𓏏𓁸' contains the letters _b_𓅱d for beard, the other letters so far were inexplicable.  
The situation looks much less dire in Latgalian:  

𓐍 𓃀 𓊃 𓅱 𓏏 𓁸||beard|< 𓃀𓊃𓅱𓏏⋍𓐍bzvd'⋍buorzda@ Latgalian  𓊃𓅱𓏏 ⋍ साथ sāth  

drink 𓋴𓅨𓂋𓇋𓀁 GER.ti  
drink 𓏏𓐍𓈗 dkr/dger ⋍ GERti < Tiger/Tigris?  
dgert ⇔ durst  

to live: Gyventi > GENE ...  
to know:  ism < išmanyti < wis.man.do / wisdom < weise.tun / Waīstun <3 !!!  

𓋳 Garment matches fine 𓋴+[𓏠](𓏠)+𓈖+[𓏏](𓏏), however Latvian offers a different reading:  
𓋳 suknelė : s+gmn+nil < [𓋴](𓋴)+[𓏠](𓏠)+[𓈖](𓈖).  We have yet another totally different order in a similar word  
𓏠𓈖𓐍𓏏𓋳 Mönchskutte? same signs  

These may be puns, dialectic readings, or just different words with the same 'root' letters.
