<p>Three big waves of neolithic people reached Germany, as distinguished by genomic clusters:<br />
First the early Anatolian Farmers<br />
Then the Corded Ware with close Steppe ancestry and<br />
the Únětice with mixed ancestry from the Danubian bronze age and the south/west (The preceding pan european "Beaker phenomenon" seems to have originated in portugal)</p>

<ol>
  <li>The Anatolians:<br />
high genetic homogeneity among all Middle Neolithic individuals (haplogroup G2), with a large majority exhibiting either no or low Western hunter-gatherer ancestry introgression  (haplogroups C,I,N1) and no significant differences between burial rites</li>
</ol>

<p>In general however Neolithic mortuary rites and population composition have been shown to vary greatly</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The mixed sons of the steppe</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The mixed cultures of europe<br />
the Únětice culture has been cited as a pan-European cultural phenomenon[20] whose influence covered large areas due to intensive exchange, with Únětice pottery and bronze artefacts found from Ireland to Scandinavia, the Italian Peninsula, and the Balkans.[21] As such, it is candidate for a community connecting a continuum of already scattered, late Indo-European languages, ancestral to the Italo-Celtic, Germanic, and perhaps Balto–Slavic groups, between which words were frequently exchanged, and a common lexicon, as well as regional isoglosses were shared.[22]</p>

<p>The first wave was an (almost) complete substitution of previous hunter gatherer societies:<br />
"We were able to model Croatia_North-East_MN as a mixture of 2.4 ± 1% WHG and 97.6 ± 1% Anatolia_N, and even a 100% Anatolia_N model fits the data (p = 0.11), which is congruent with previous studies that show very low WHG introgression in the Balkans and Hungarian Neolithic. Using Iron Gates hunter-gatherers instead of WHG produced very similar results. In contrast to Middle Neolithic populations from central and Western Europe which show additional WHG gene flow during this time.</p>

<p>The relatively high mitochondrial haplotype diversity and very low Y chromosomal diversity among related males suggests the inhumed individuals belonged to a community characterised by female exogamy and adher- ence to a patrilocal social organisation,also observed at other Late Neolithic and Bronze Age cemeteries in Europe</p>

<p>Steppe-related ancestry absent in the Neolithic but found widely among Eurasian Copper and Bronze Age populations. lactose tolerance in Europe still remained at low frequency into the Bronze Age.</p>

<p>Genetic transformation following the Bronze Age. In Croatia neither Bronze Age groups approximate present-day populations from the region in PCA space, indicating that further significant population changes have since occurred, or that the mixed fringe populations began to dominate the old Anatolian ancestry. In Croatia a broadly present-day genetic signature had already formed by Roman times, and any further population turnovers were not as significant as previous ones.</p>
