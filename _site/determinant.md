Egyptian Determinants are similar to Sumerian [determinatives](determinatives.html)  

Determinants as parts of [Nouns](Nouns) help disambiguate the [alphabet](Alphabet)ical reading of a word.  

```  
New York 𓊖  
New York City  
```  

Even though they are not always spoken we postulate that they had always one or more phonetic values.

It is not always evident whether the determinants repeat the foregoing letters or complement them:  

𓍲 𓈖 𓏌 𓏲 [𓁸](𓁸)  
Schnur𓏲Haar  

1) SchnurrHaar = whisker  
2) Schnur Haar = string cord  
3) Schnur := Haar  

Because of this ambiguity it is not always certain what the true reading of a determinant is, and we assume that many readings of determinants in the current literature about pharaonic Egyptian are confused:  
We have the suspicion that the value of determinants is usually assumed to be known and the letters or signs proceeding them mostly act as qualifiers:  

[𓄛](𓄛) Tier deer der (leather) :  
* 𓍋𓃀𓏲𓄛𓏪 L'BanTier  
* 𓍋𓃀𓏲𓃮 el Panther  
* 𓍋𓃀𓅱𓃰 El'phanter  

Preterminants are also spoken in Chinese, where 𓄜 ⋍ 只:  
一只老虎 🐅   𓍋𓃀𓏲𓃮  
ZEW Zähleinheitswort  

we see how Determinants can also act to *complete* the previous letters.  

𓐍 𓂝 𓅱 𓋴 𓀜 “build” = cons+struck𓀜  
𓐍𓇋𓇋𓀔 kurio, chi𓀔 child, הlad ילד 𓀔  
𓄡𓇋𓇋𓂋𓏏𓀔 chird / child scird ѥti: kid + !!  

Terminal symbols of [nouns](Nouns)  

Most ubiquitous abstract terminal symbols are:  
[𓏛](𓏛) 'ter' general terminal symbol for nouns, verbs,etc see  
[𓏥](𓏥) III Terminal symbol for [plural](Plural) nouns, verbs etc see [numbers](Numbers)  
[𓇾](𓇾) Terminal symbol for ‘ter’(terra,terrain) see [𓇿](𓇿)TA/ter, al𓏛TER altair altar

# Complement rule
Words are often spelled out with different readings to the determinant:  

𓇥 𓂋 𓇋 𓇋 𓏏 𓅭  kite    (krait √[cry](cry.html))  
𓇥 𓂋 𓏏 𓅃     kite

𓃀 𓅡 𓄿 𓇋 𓇋 𓊗 𓏮 𓏲 𓅭 | wasp | bvásp vespa (𓊃𓊪𓊗 spät)  ☑ ⇔ bee ⇔ 𓅭ben/bint/bat (son/daughter)  

𓃀 𓅡 𓄿 𓎛 𓂺 phallus, penis 𓂸  ⇔ [phoenix](phoenix.html) 𓅡  


𓋴 𓂋 𓅾 1. Graugans 2. Grangst > [Gans](gans) 3. 𓋴 𓂋 goose [𓋴=gamma 𓂋=os]  

Possible confusions of specifiers with word reading:

# [Bad Linguistics](Bad Linguistics.html)
In the past some mistakes were made by premature identification of alternate signs in words with the same (or similar) meanings, e.g. :  

Two words for sky  
sky 𓊪 𓏏 𓇯  
sky 𓁷 𓏏 𓇯  
may lead to an unwary identification of 𓁷 as 𓊪.  

This should never be done since it is possible that these are completely different words that just happen to have a final (middle?) 𓏏 :  

𓇯       sky, heaven  
𓊪 𓏏 𓇯       sky, heaven  
𓁷 𓏏 𓇯       sky, heaven  
𓁷 𓂋 𓏏 𓇯     sky, heaven  
𓄿 𓂋 𓏏 𓇯     heaven, sky  

This kind of identification is however rampant in the reconstruction of phonetic sign values, often because we just dont have the phonetic value for many extra alphabetic signs, which value was usually assumed to be known and rarly spelled out, e.g.  
𓋁 𓊡 east wind was known to represent the longer form 𓋁 𓃀 𓏏 𓊡  ( ⇔ [wind](wind.html) [bend](bend.html) [levante](levante.html) )  

The extra '𓃀 𓏏' could also be a specific 'kind' of east wind, could belong to 𓋁 etc…
