<p>The concept of <a href="Eurasian">Eurasian</a> languages entails the observation that most if not all European and Asian languages are <em>somewhat</em> related.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostratic_languages">Nostratic</a> theories go a bit further in asserting common ancestry from the fertile Crescent or even from the groups which left Africa. Given our knowledge of human migration this might seem somewhat obvious and trivial; the disputed points are how much of a common stratum is left and detectable, and how much of the noticeable similarities go back to the relatively recent (4000BC) expansion of <a href="Home">urbanization</a> and metallurgy.</p>

<p>The strongest connections can be found between Indo-European and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Uralic_Swadesh_lists">Finno-Uralic</a> languages, yielding the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Uralic_languages">Indo-Uralic_languages</a>.</p>

<p>Quoth:<br />
    «If all these and many other resemblances that might be adduced do not prove the common origin of Aryan and Ugrian, and if we assume that the Ugrians borrowed not only a great part of their vocabulary, but also many of their derivative syllables, together with at least the personal endings of their verbs from Aryan, then the whole fabric of comparative philology falls to the ground, and we are no longer justified in inferring from the similarity of the inflections in Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit that these languages have a common origin.»</p>

<p>Dravidian is one of the primary language families in the <a href="Nostratic">Nostratic</a> proposal, which would link most languages in North Africa, Europe and Western Asia into a family with its origins in the Fertile Crescent sometime between the last Ice Age and the emergence of proto-Indo-European 4–6 thousand years BCE. However, many linguists believe that such deep connections are not, or not yet, demonstrable.</p>
