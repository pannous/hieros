The 4th millenium took the early roots of civilization, culminating in [[Varna]], [[Maykop]], [[Uruk]] and [[Mehrgarh]] and saw the full development of related [[Kurgan]] and Ziggurat traditions: The hithero unknown construction of huge tombs for elites (different to previous communal [[megalithic]] constructs).  

The millenium of the pyramid, the 3rd millenium BC was not confined to Egypt. As oceangoing [[sail]]boats and [[carts]] were a well established technology by that time, pyramid building kings reached [[persia]] in [Sialk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tepe_Sialk), the [[indus]] valley, [[china]] in Shimao,  and [[peru]] in [Caral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral).
