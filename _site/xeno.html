<p>xenotic sound or syllables are those unfamiliar to 'our' modern ears and  tongues:</p>

<p>The word xeno itself probably contained an exotic xenotic sound</p>

<p><a href="ìç≤.html">ìç≤</a></p>

<p>when confronted with such a sound we often find approximations which may or may not be very similar or different resulting in divergence of wanderwords<br />

<p>what is familiar to our ears  might be strange to other, for example there are languages without clear p,b,f distinctions and without consonant clusters kr,pr,spr,str,...</p>

<p>Before and during the neolithic revolution, the eurasian language landscape was probably littered with all kinds of strange vocal articulations; as can still be  witnessed in <a href="caucasian.html">caucasian</a> tongues</p>

<p>other consonant clusters are so ubiquitous that they should deserve a character of their own: tsh,dj,...</p>

<p>In retrospect it is often unclear whether there was a complicated sound or just a cluster of consonants which fused: see the peculiar <a href="qp.html">qp</a>/<a href="qv.html">qv</a> clusters</p>

<p>it is also possible that to a completely unrelated words were fused by neighboring countries resulting in orthographic peculiarities and <a href="ambi.html">ambi</a>guous signs.</p>

<p>Some sounds are not  truly  complicated but just sit in the middle between two familiar sounds:<br />
greek semi &lt; <a href="Œ¥.html">Œ¥</a><a href="Œµ.html">Œµ</a>ŒºŒ∑‚ãçdsemi &gt; demi</p>

<p>of these foreign sounds result in <a href="sound change.html">sound change</a>s and ultimately the disappearance and appreciation into vowels</p>
