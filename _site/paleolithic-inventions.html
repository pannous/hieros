<p>Middle Paleolithic</p>

<p>The dawn of homo sapiens around 300 ka coincides with the start of the Middle Paleolithic period. Towards the middle of this 250,000-year period, humans begin to migrate out of Africa, and the later part of the period shows the beginning of long-distance trade, religious rites and other behavior associated with Behavioral modernity.</p>

<p>Three different innovation events relating to <strong>fire</strong>:<br />
<strong>Usage of fire</strong>: early middle paleolithic? 1.8 Ma ago, but not a single heated lithic 1 mya<br />
<strong>Guarding of fire</strong>: <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/118/31/e2101108118">Middle pleistocene?</a> with global cultural spread 400k-250k ago in different hominin subpopulations<br />

<p>Upper Paleolithic to Early Mesolithic</p>

<p>50 ka has been regarded by some as the beginning of Behavioral modernity, defining the Upper Paleolithic period, which lasted nearly 40,000 years (though some research dates the beginning of behavioral modernity earlier to the Middle Paleolithic). This is characterized by the widespread observation of religious rites, artistic expression and the appearance of tools made for purely intellectual or artistic pursuits.</p>

<p>The Harifians are viewed as migrating out of the Fayyum and the eastern deserts of Egypt during the late Mesolithic to merge with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)[b] culture, whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. This assimilation led to the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, a group of cultures that invented nomadic pastoralism, and may have been the original culture which spread Proto-Semitic languages throughout Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Around 6000 BC, Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt.[19] Studies based on morphological, genetic, and archaeological data have attributed these settlements to migrants from the Fertile Crescent</p>
