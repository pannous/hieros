<p>Levallois technique</p>

<p>A hand axe has a long blade with different curves and angles, some sharper and others more resistant, including points and notches. All of this is combined in one tool, hand axe as "Swiss Army Knife"</p>

<p>700ka H. heidelbergensis may have been able to carry out coordinated hunting strategies, and consequently they seem to have had a higher dependence on meat.</p>

<p>The dawn of homo sapiens around 300 ka coincides with the start of the Middle Paleolithic period. Towards the middle of this 250,000-year period, humans begin to migrate out of Africa, and the later part of the period shows the beginning of long-distance trade, religious rites and other behavior associated with Behavioral modernity.</p>

<p>Upper Paleolithic to Early Mesolithic</p>

<p>50 ka has been regarded by some as the beginning of Behavioral modernity, defining the Upper Paleolithic period, which lasted nearly 40,000 years (though some research dates the beginning of behavioral modernity earlier to the Middle Paleolithic). This is characterized by the widespread observation of religious rites, artistic expression and the appearance of tools made for purely intellectual or artistic pursuits.</p>

<p>Before the arrival of modern farmers, both Aboriginal Australians and Papuans engaged in forms of plant management that were sophisticated yet distinctively different from conventional agriculture.</p>

<p><strong>Aboriginal Australians</strong>:<br />
Aboriginal plant management was characterized by a blend of horticulture and wild harvesting rather than formal cultivation. They practiced fire-stick farming, which involved the deliberate setting of fires to manage landscapes and encourage the growth of beneficial plant species. This form of environmental management promoted the abundance of particular plants that were useful for food, medicinal purposes, and tool-making. Key species included various fruits, nuts, seeds, and tubers such as the yam daisy. These practices ensured sustainable food sources and supported the stability and health of ecosystems.</p>

<p><strong>Papuans</strong>:<br />
In contrast, Papuans developed a more recognizable form of agriculture that included the deliberate cultivation of plants. They are known for early forms of agriculture in the highlands, dating back at least 10,000 years(introduced by sea farers?). Key crops included taro, yams, and bananas, among others. Papuans practiced shifting cultivation, where land was cleared, cultivated for several years, and then left fallow to regenerate. This type of cultivation is part of a broader swidden or slash-and-burn agriculture system. Papuans also engaged in the cultivation of sugarcane, various roots, and leafy vegetables, employing complex multi-cropping strategies to maximize yield and minimize risk.</p>

<p><strong>Aboriginal Australians</strong>:<br />
Aboriginal Australians utilized a variety of natural materials for constructing <strong>shelters</strong>, depending on the climate and region. In the arid and desert regions, shelters were often made from branches and brush, sometimes covered with earth or sand for insulation. In forested and coastal areas, materials such as bark (especially from trees like the paperbark) and leaves were more commonly used. While animal skins were used for various purposes such as cloaks, bags, and water containers, there is no widespread evidence of their use in making tents or large shelters. Their shelters were typically temporary and designed to suit the nomadic aspects of their lifestyle, which involved moving within their traditional lands according to seasonal availability of food and water resources.</p>

<p><strong>Papuans</strong>:<br />
In Papua New Guinea, traditional shelters and houses were mostly constructed from plant materials like wood, bamboo, and leaves, including the iconic stilt houses in coastal and swampy areas designed to protect against flooding and pests. In the highlands, materials like grass and tree ferns were used for thatching. Papuans utilized animal hides for various tools and ornaments, but not typically for shelter. Their communities often involved more permanent village setups compared to the more nomadic lifestyle of many Aboriginal Australian groups.</p>

<p>Tents? and Houses?<br />

<p>The Harifians are viewed as migrating out of the Fayyum and the eastern deserts of Egypt during the late Mesolithic to merge with the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB)[b] culture, whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. This assimilation led to the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, a group of cultures that invented nomadic pastoralism, and may have been the original culture which spread Proto-Semitic languages throughout Mesopotamia.</p>

<p>Around 6000 BC, Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt. Studies based on morphological, genetic, and archaeological data have attributed these settlements to migrants from the Fertile Crescent</p>
