<p>"Holy marriage" is an euphemism for temple prostitution, which was one of the building blocks of early civilization. Sex sells, and this sure was one means to attract the natives.</p>

<p>This cult was very similar in Sumeria and Egypt alike:<br />

<p>"sacred prostitution" was known in Cyprus <a href="𓋹">𓋹</a>(Greek-settled since 1100 BC), Sicily (Hellenized since 750 BC), in the Kingdom of Pontus (8th century BC) and in <a href="𓋹">𓋹</a>Cappadocia (c. 330 BC hellenized)!</p>

<p>Sumer</p>

<p>According to the noted Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer, kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of Sumer established their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival Akitu.[26]</p>

<p>Hittites</p>

<p>The Hittites practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.[27]</p>
