<p>The letters representing ‘f’ were prone to corruption, and have caused much scholarly confusion and frustration for various reasons:</p>

<p>It was lost in translation in languages which don’t posses the phonological equivalent of f.<br />
It is similar to f ⋍ v ⋍ wh ⋍ ph and other variants in other languages, some pronunciations unfamiliar to English.</p>

<p>Especially <a href="𓆑">𓆑</a> was also associated with forbidden taboos and temporarily erased from hieroglyph inscriptions.<br />
In demotic times scribes went wild in the character.</p>

<p>One clear shift in the reading of the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> Alphabet is the dangling i which was originally just an ordinary fi and its inverse which was a similar fi</p>

<p>ordinary <a href="f">f</a>i : पि ﬀi</p>

<p>Both पि And पी should be transcribed as fi and fi, namely fphi and phfi or fi+p and p+fi,<br />
similar to the ph in physics or German Pferd.</p>

<p>There was a global shift from va to a in all alphabets:</p>

<p>Latin atta, Ancient Greek ἄττα (átta), Gothic 𐌰𐍄𐍄𐌰 (atta), Old Church Slavonic отьць (otĭcĭ).</p>

<p><a href="𓇋.html">𓇋</a><a href="𓏏.html">𓏏</a><a href="𓆑.html">𓆑</a> father (not : attav)</p>

<p>It is not that 𐌰𐍄𐍄𐌰 was orignially pronounced 'atta', it is that the strange orthographic convention<br />
alpha = al'PHA ⋍ V at beginning of words was lost/discarded!</p>

<p>One needs to be careful reading old scripts in similar alphabets with our modern pronounciation!<br />
Other orthographic conventions / lost components were gg⋍ng <a href="i.html">i</a>&lt;r <a href="epsilon.html">epsilon</a>&lt;s aa⋍va/ma</p>

<p>NO SUCH CUNEIFORM</p>
