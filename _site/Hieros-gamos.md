"Holy marriage" is an euphemism for temple prostitution, which was one of the building blocks of early civilization. Sex sells, and this sure was one means to attract the natives.  

This cult was very similar in Sumeria and Egypt alike:

"sacred prostitution" was known in Cyprus [𓋹](𓋹)(Greek-settled since 1100 BC), Sicily (Hellenized since 750 BC), in the Kingdom of Pontus (8th century BC) and in [𓋹](𓋹)Cappadocia (c. 330 BC hellenized)!  

Sumer  

According to the noted Assyriologist Samuel Noah Kramer, kings in the ancient Near Eastern region of Sumer established their legitimacy by taking part in a ritual sexual act in the temple of the fertility goddess Ishtar every year on the tenth day of the New Year festival Akitu.[26]  

Hittites  

The Hittites practiced sacred prostitution as part of a cult of deities, including the worship of a mated pair of deities, a bull god and a lion goddess, while in later days it was the mother-goddess who became prominent, representing fertility, and (in Phoenicia) the goddess who presided over human birth.[27]  

These double lions from the Far East were deified and actually had a name: 𓃭𓏤𓃭𓅱𓈗 "[Ruti](ruti)"/"[Akkar-Dei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aker_(god))"
