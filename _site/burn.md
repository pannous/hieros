Cremation became dominant in Europe during the Late Bronze Age, particularly with the Urnfield culture (~1300–800 BCE), which covered Central Europe, extending from Hungary to France and northern Italy. This transition replaced earlier single inhumation customs, such as those of the Corded Ware and Nordic Bronze Age cultures.

Urnfield expansions are associated with bronze age collapse ≈1200BC! Religious cultural shifts!

Cremation in Iran was never dominant due to early religious opposition, but some evidence of fire rituals in Elam, Andronovo and BMAC (marginal groups? which ones?)

Avesta (Yasna 49.11, Vendidad 8:73–96):
•	Strongly forbids cremation, considering fire sacred.
•	This prohibition reflects a religious reform by Zarathustra (~1200–1000 BCE), likely opposing an older cremation tradition.
