Evidence about the Hurrian language is scarce and indirect, thus possibly leading to many false assumptions and conclusions.

It is often assumed that the Hurro-Urartian languages, or a pre-split Proto-Hurro-Urartian language, were originally spoken by people who engaged in the [Kura-Araxes](Kura-Araxes.html) culture in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Syria and far beyond.

The largest and most influential Hurrian nation was the kingdom of Mitanni, its ruling class perhaps being Indo-Iranian speakers.  

Urartian is closely related to Hurrian  

Hurrian 2300–1000 BC
Urartian  9th–6th BC

Early proposals for an external genetic relationship of Hurro-Urartian variously grouped them with the Kartvelian languages, Elamite, NE Caucasian

[Some argue](https://academia.edu/resource/work/40055347) for it have connections to the [PIE](PIE.html) language family.  

Urartian was also rarely written in the "Anatolian hieroglyphs" used for the Luwian language.  

Commenting on this:  
```  
A first set of phonemes is richly documented  : *H4, *bh, *dh, *ğh, *H1, *H2, *l, *m, *n, *H3, *p, *s, *w. These phonemes belong to the voiced aspirated, laryngeal and resonant series. They represent the phonological core of PIE. It is unclear if word-initial *st should be considered a phoneme on its own.  
- A second set seems to be fairly rare: *gw, *gh, *ghw, *y, *kw.  
```  

The reason that gw, *[gh](gh.html), *ghw, *[y](y.html), *[kw](kw.html) are rare is that they are identical with one of H1 H2 H3 / *ğ, *g, *gw.  the voiceless phonemes *ǩ, *k, *t do not seem to combine with laryngeals  

PIE √H4ebh-, *H4ew- ‘some kind of oat or grass seed’  
IEW *awiğ- ‘Hafer’ *Haewis ‘oats’  Heu Latin avēna ‘oat’:  

PIE √H4ed- ‘at, to(ward)’ (a well-established root)  
IEW 3 *ad- ‘zu, bei, an’, Mallory–Adams 484 *Haed- (WC) ‘at, to’ Hurrian -da- ‘Dative–Allative’ (Cf. Latin dominō-d)  

PIE √H4el- ‘other’ (a well-established root) alternate alas else:  
IEW 24–26 *al-: *alyos ‘anderer’, Mallory–Adams 485 *Haélyos ‘other’ Hurrian alaše ‘(if) otherwise’ (BGH 16)  
Hurrian and Urartian uli ‘other’ (BGH 484) (ul- < zero-grade)  
Hurrian ullui ‘on the other hand’ (BGH 488)  
According to Hurrian, the laryngeal is *H4.  

PIE √bheH4-l- ‘to deceive, be false’ (a new root)  
Cf. Latin falsus ‘false’,  
Greek ἀποφώλιος ‘worthless, futile’  **Abfall**  
Hurrian βalˢ- ‘false, wrong’ (BGH 291–92)
