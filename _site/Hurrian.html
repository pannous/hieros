<p>Evidence about the Hurrian language is scarce and indirect, thus possibly leading to many false assumptions and conclusions.</p>

<p>It is often assumed that the Hurro-Urartian languages, or a pre-split Proto-Hurro-Urartian language, were originally spoken by people who engaged in the <a href="Kura-Araxes.html">Kura-Araxes</a> culture in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Syria and far beyond.</p>

<p>The largest and most influential Hurrian nation was the kingdom of Mitanni, its ruling class perhaps being Indo-Iranian speakers.</p>

<p>Urartian is closely related to Hurrian</p>

<p>Hurrian 2300–1000 BC
Urartian  9th–6th BC</p>

<p>Early proposals for an external genetic relationship of Hurro-Urartian variously grouped them with the Kartvelian languages, Elamite, NE Caucasian</p>

<p><a href="https://academia.edu/resource/work/40055347">Some argue</a> for it have connections to the <a href="PIE.html">PIE</a> language family.</p>

<p>Urartian was also rarely written in the "Anatolian hieroglyphs" used for the Luwian language.</p>

<p>Commenting on this:<br />
<code> 
A first set of phonemes is richly documented  : *H4, *bh, *dh, *ğh, *H1, *H2, *l, *m, *n, *H3, *p, *s, *w. These phonemes belong to the voiced aspirated, laryngeal and resonant series. They represent the phonological core of PIE. It is unclear if word-initial *st should be considered a phoneme on its own.  
- A second set seems to be fairly rare: *gw, *gh, *ghw, *y, *kw.  
</code></p>

<p>The reason that gw, *<a href="gh.html">gh</a>, *ghw, *<a href="y.html">y</a>, *<a href="kw.html">kw</a> are rare is that they are identical with one of H1 H2 H3 / *ğ, *g, *gw.  the voiceless phonemes *ǩ, *k, *t do not seem to combine with laryngeals</p>

<p>PIE *H4ebh-, *H4ew- ‘some kind of oat or grass seed’<br />
IEW *awiğ- ‘Hafer’ *Haewis ‘oats’  Heu Latin avēna ‘oat’:</p>

<p>PIE *H4ed- ‘at, to(ward)’ (a well-established root)<br />
IEW 3 *ad- ‘zu, bei, an’, Mallory–Adams 484 *Haed- (WC) ‘at, to’ Hurrian -da- ‘Dative–Allative’ (Cf. Latin dominō-d)</p>

<p>PIE *H4el- ‘other’ (a well-established root) alternate alas else:<br />
IEW 24–26 *al-: *alyos ‘anderer’, Mallory–Adams 485 *Haélyos ‘other’ Hurrian alaše ‘(if) otherwise’ (BGH 16)<br />
Hurrian and Urartian uli ‘other’ (BGH 484) (ul- &lt; zero-grade)<br />

According to Hurrian, the laryngeal is *H4.</p>
