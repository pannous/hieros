# Manasseh, one of the Twelve Tribes
Manasseh or Menashe מְנַשֶּׁה  was, according to the Book of Genesis, the first son of Joseph and Asenath.  

Manasseh was born in Egypt before the arrival of the children of Israel from Canaan (Genesis 48:5).  
Asenath (𓅭𓏏 𓌢𓏏?) was an Egyptian woman whom the Pharaoh gave to Joseph as wife, and the daughter of Potipherah (𐀡𐀴…), a priest of On 𓉺𓏌𓊖 (Genesis 41:50–52).
