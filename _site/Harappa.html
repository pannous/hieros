The one HARAPPA individual for which <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/indus-valley-civilization-dna-has-long-eluded-researchers/597481/">we have DNA</a> shows no steppe anchestry, but a mixture of 11ky old Iranian and Indian Hunter Gatherer.<br />
Later populations show significant steppe admixture.</p>

<p>There were two major migrations into India in the last 10,000 years.</p>

<p>The first one originated from the Zagros region in south-western Iran (which has the world's first evidence for <strong>goat</strong> domestication) and brought <strong>agriculturists</strong>, most likely herders, to India.</p>

<p>This would have been between 7,000 and 3,000BCE. These Zagrosian herders mixed with the earlier inhabitants of the subcontinent - the First Indians, descendants of the Out of Africa (OoA) migrants who had reached India around 65,000 years ago - and together, they went on to create the Harappan civilisation.</p>

<p>In the centuries after 2000 BCE came the second set of immigrants (the Aryans) from the Eurasian Steppe, probably from the region now known as Kazakhstan. They likely brought with them an early version of <strong>Sanskrit</strong>, mastery over horses and a range of new cultural practices such as sacrificial rituals, all of which formed the basis of early Hindu/Vedic culture.</p>

<p>Sanskrit has significantly influenced the phonology, lexicology, morphology and grammatical systems of South Indian languages[30] of Kannada,[31] Telugu,[30] Tamil[32] and Malayalam.[33]</p>

<p>There is (still) no direct evidence of any such thing as an "Aryan Invasion". This might be due to Aryans being 'city-smiters' but one would at least expect to find some remnants of their camps.</p>

<p>“The  horse-and  chariot-rich  Vedic  texts  are  characterized  by  small tribal units of late Bronze Age pastoralists roaming around the Punjab”.</p>

<p>Evidence for the so-called massacre of the population of Mohenjo-Daro (Wheeler 1966) was actually found in several archaeological layers, and the irregular arrangement of skeletons may very well be due to flooding that swept the corpses into a street corner and buried them here and there.</p>

<p>According to Surahmaniam et.al., (2019) people from NW India were migrating into Central Asia in large numbers in the third millennium BCE.</p>

<p>“If the steppe nomads had a dominating presence in North-West India in thesubsequent centuries, it would certainly be reflected in the culture and lifestyleof  the  locals.   But  what  is  apparent  in  the  area  has  nothing  in  common  withthose  of  second-millennium  steppes.   But  there  are  many  similarities  betweenthe culture and life style of IVC settlements and those in the Ganga YamunaDoab and areas further east in later centuries. There are obvious signs of culturalcontinuity between IVC and these later settlements and many of these can befound even in present-day Indians.”</p>

<p>A  recentpaper by Won Joon Lee et.al published in Japanese Association of Anatomists reports details of first ever craniofacial reconstruction of the Indus Valley Civilization individuals found at the 4500 year old Rakhigarhi cemetery.  These were  of  a  male  of  16-18  years  age  and  a  female  of  35-50  years.   The  craniumand the facial features are very similar to present population of the area.  Thesepeople were ** unusually tall** for the period; the young man was almost 6 feet and the woman was 5 feet 8 inches in height. Reminescent of the red haired 6 foot <a href="Jiroft.html">Jiroft</a> queen.</p>

<p>In fact we suggest (and David Reich's recent DNA analysis tentatively confirms) that the Harappa civilzation beloged to the Iranian-Anatolian technology expansion wave, which dispersed Copper technology across Eurasia. This is slightly different to the second wave which brought Bronze technology and chariot riding. Did the first wave speak something like Dravidian, Semitic, Uralic, PIE or something entirely different? Because of relative cultural continuation it is perceivable that even the first wave (after the goat expansion which reached <a href="Mehrgarh.html">Mehrgarh</a> 7000BC) spoke PIE:</p>

<p>“Most words for flora and fauna,  names of rivers and mountains in Indic languages have clear Indo Aryan/Indo European etymologies.  This would mean that  if  Indo  Aryan  languages  had  first  reached  South  Asia  in  the  middle  of the  second  millennium  BCE,  the  new  migrants  forced  a  complete  change  in these  names,  which  is  very  unlikely.   We  have  the  parallel  cases  of  Americas, Australia and many others, where the new migrants had overwhelming military, technological and organizational superiority over the locals and yet most river, mountain and place names were adopted from those used earlier by the locals. Even more unlikely, in the case of most of South Asia, even personal names were changed to Indo Aryan ones.  The most plausible inference that can account forthe above would be that Proto Indo Aryan language reached North India at a time when these areas were sparsely populated by very primitive communities,which should be before the sixth millennium BCE.”</p>

<p>There  are  many  references  in  Rgveda  to  River  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati#Saraswati_as_a_river"><strong>Sarasvati</strong></a>.   Many  hymns describe it as a very large river.  RV 10.75 says it flowed between River Yamuna and Satlej.  A palaeo-canal that fits the description is now visible in the area. But this river had become a small rain-fed one by 3000 BCE and dried up by 2000 BCE, just about the time Harappan civilization was disintegrating.</p>

<p>Top-level Haplogroups like R*, R1and R2 based SNP individuals are found in some pockets in Pakistan and NW India. Tribes such as the Chenchus speak a Dravidian language and have not mixed with others for over 3000 years. Together this suggests that R1 gene flow was from South Asia to Yamnaya and not the other way round. Special importance should be given to the study of <a href="gypsies.html">gypsies</a>.</p>

<p>Many of these texts describe the position of the polar star Dhruva Nakshatra in detail. It is said that it was in ‘Simsumara’ constellation. The constellation is stated to have 14 stars andall are named after various Vedic Devas and demigods, though the names oftendiffer in different texts.  Dhruva was the last in the tail of Simsumara or Dolphin.This description matches that of what we now call the Draco constellation inevery respect. Draco or dragon also has 14 visible stars. Thuban is the last in thetail of Draco.  Kochab and Polaris do not match this description in any way. Thuban or α Draconis was the polar star about 2900 BCE.</p>

<p>As Pargiter has pointed out, the north-West frontier never had any ancient sacred memories and was never regarded with reverence.  On the contrary, it was thought of as land of barbarians or as ‘Mlecha’ country; a very unlikely attitude if their ancestor’s home-land was in that  direction.</p>

<p>The only ‘migration myth’ mentioned in Vedic literatureis the one by the first man; <a href="Menes">Manu</a>, from the south; across the seas.</p>

<p>Conclusion: The composers of the Rgveda, "Aryans" must have been present at the flourishing of the Harappa civilization, likely being their <a href="PIE">founders</a>. That would make PIE slightly older, namely originating from ⋍4000BC. Harappans where <a href="human">children of man</a>, coming via Susa or most definately via the Persian sea.</p>

<p>The split of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_R1a">R1a</a> (M420) is computed to ca. 22,000 years ago. Of the European  R1a-M417  samples,  more  than  96%  were  assigned to R1a-Z282, whereas 98.4% of the 490 Central and South Asian R1a lineages belonged to hg R1a-Z93.” There is a common ancestor for the European branch of R1a (Z282) and Indian branch of R1a (M780) but neither is a parent of the other.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Harappa culture was by far the most populous of its time (west of China), just like the Hindi are now.</p>
