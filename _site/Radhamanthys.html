<p>Hyksos of typical Indo European stock:<br />
<strong>Ratha</strong> was a name prefix very prominent in the second millennium BC, as it was the name of drivers the newly invented bit-steered-chariot. (Ritter, rider, rad 𓇳 ray 𒋥 rho ρ 日ri)</p>

<p>Because of the Indian short vowel "Rtha" it entered Greece as 'ortho' 'artchie' 'archae' Ἀρχιμήδης (Arkhimḗdēs).<br />
It's meaning more or less preserved: right/rule ἀρχός (arkhós) = leader (rex in latin). Order in english.</p>

<p>Another 'indian' form <strong>Raha</strong> was further simplified into Ra'a or just Ray/Ra/Re: 𓇳</p>

<p>The '<a href="Menge">Menge</a>' root in Radhamanthys constituted some instance of 'Muchness': Big ruler, ruler of many, ruler of mankind or something similar.</p>

<p>The '<a href="Menge">Menge</a>' root was reduced to 'mega' in Greece, 'much' and 'measure' in English and <a href="medi">medi</a>:<br />

<p>So Menge originally was more like Mendge similar to Menschen [mankind].</p>

<p>In any case Archimedes was probably an echo, a reflection or just a corruption of Radhamanthys.</p>

<p>He was the most prominent Egyptian ruler for the Greeks, who just dropped the 'Raha' title and called him 'Menes', just like the half-legendary Founding Father of Egypt:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes.</p>
