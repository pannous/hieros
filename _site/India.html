<p>beads from Thailand or Vietnam and even Java. And “just tons” of Indian material including gems and pearls, woven mats and baskets, as well as rice and a jar containing more than 16 pounds of peppercorns</p>

<p>the trade route didn’t end at Muziris but would have continued across land and sea to India’s east coast and on to China. From his perspective, it was Muziris, not Berenike, that formed the “junction between East and West,” the central hub that connected the known world.</p>

<p>In the early first century A.D., before trade reached its peak, the Greek geographer Strabo described eastbound fleets of more than 100 merchant ships. the Roman tax revenues from Indian Ocean trade may have generated 10% to one-third of the empire’s total income.</p>

<p>Still it may have been the Indians, not the Romans, who instigated and drove Indian Ocean trade. Buddha and Sanscrit inscription in Berenike.</p>
