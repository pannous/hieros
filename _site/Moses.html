Isa Al-Masih Jesus Messiah<br />
ʿĪsā ibn Maryam ≈ Jesus Christ<br />
Khristós Χριστός, 'Christ' "anointed"</p>

<p>The title was interpreted in many different ways by Muslim exegetes, all of which tended to downplay the connection of the word to Jesus' central role in Christianity as the savior-God.</p>

<p>Many interpretations of the word existed. The Arabic lexicographer Fairuzabadi (1329–1414) listed no less than 49 different meanings for the title al-Masīḥ as elaborated by Quranic exegetes.[11] Most exegetes (correctly) understood the word to be equivalent to the passive participle of the root m-s-ḥ, meaning 'wiped', 'touched', 'anointed'. Interpretations based on this derivation included that Jesus had been 'touched' by the wing of the archangel Gabriel at birth in order to safeguard him from Satan, that he had been 'anointed' with oil (as all the prophets in Islamic tradition), or that he had been 'anointed' with the blessing (Arabic: Baraka) of God.[12]</p>

<p>Other interpretations took the word to be an active form of the root m-s-ḥ, meaning 'wiping', 'touching', etc. This interpretation was often connected to the idea of Jesus as healing the sick by 'touching' them, or because he purified believers by 'wiping' away their sins.[13] This latter interpretation, which among others was given by the Ismaili jurist al-Qāḍī al-Nu‘mān (died 974),[14] was often criticized because it violates the principle found throughout the Quran that every believer is responsible for their own virtues and sins, and that only God can forgive sin.[15]</p>

<p>Finally, some interpreters of the Quran took the word masīḥ to be derived not from the root m-s-ḥ, but rather from the root s-y-ḥ, meaning 'to travel', believing Jesus to have received this title because of his itinerant lifestyle.</p>
