<h2 id="alignment-axiom">Alignment axiom</h2>

<p>Two words shall be called aligned or alignable when their progressive Levenshtein distance is low, that is, when they have high phonetic similarity compatible with universal <a href="sound-change.html">sound-change</a> correspondences.</p>

<p>As such alignment is per se orthogonal to relatedness. However aligned words have a high (but not perfect) <a href="chance.html">chance</a> of being <a href="related.html">related</a> in the classical or extended senses, or through various forms of connectedness.</p>

<p>Alignment is a soft form of <a href="Phono-semantic-matching.html">Phono-semantic-matching</a> of loan words. The imported word keeps some of the sounds but the structure is severely altered to match <em>something</em> within the target language.</p>

<p>Alignment within the same language is called <a href="reanalysis.html">reanalysis</a>.</p>

<p>Alignment within the same language family is excessively frequent.</p>

<p>In polylingual societies after the big genetical mixing event of the Neolithic, such formations were probably quite frequent, especially in trade terms, additional to <a href="wanderwort.html">wanderwort</a>s.</p>
