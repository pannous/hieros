<p>From the first Eneolithic farmers who appeared at Unakozovskaya in the northwest Caucasus about 4600 BC to the Maikop culture, all of them had significant CHG ancestry, on a cline of 28-60%. But the other 72-40% of their ancestry can be modeled as an admixture of Anatolian Farmer (the great majority), Levantine Neolithic, and Ganj-Dareh-type Iranian Farmer ancestries</p>

<p>the Y-chromosome haplogroups of the Eneolithic Meshoko and Maikop men were typical Anatolian- Iranian Neolithic haplogroups (L, J2, and G2) unlike the paternal haplogroups of the steppes. Yamnaya men were almost exclusively R1b, and pre-Yamnaya Eneolithic Volga-Caspian- Caucasus steppe men were principally R1b, with a significant Q1a minority. Maikop men did not father a significant number of Yamnaya males.</p>

<p>The variety of CHG that constituted more than half of Yamnaya ancestry could have been the Mesolithic/Early Neolithic variety, like Hotu Cave or Kotias Cave, not yet admixed with Anatolian Farmer ancestry. If the CHG element in Yamnaya came from a non-admixed CHG population of this kind, they could have walked into the steppes from northwestern Iran/Azerbaijan at any time before about 5000 BC—before admixture with Anatolian Farmers began.</p>

<p>Without any doubt, a CHG population that was not admixed with Anatolian Farmers mated with EHG populations in the Volga steppes and in the North Caucasus steppes before 4500 BC.</p>

<p>After 5000 BC domesticated animals appeared in these same sites in the lower Volga, and in new ones, and in grave sacrifices at Khvalynsk</p>

<p>among 48 individuals with whole-genome aDNA from 16 Neolithic and Copper Age cemeteries in Bulgaria and Romania dated 5800-4300 BC, only three showed any ancestry from a steppe mating network (Mathieson et al. 2018). Around 95% of the southeastern European farmer population tested had no steppe relatives over a period of 1500 years. They must have actively avoided marriage with steppe people, a rule broken only among the elite towards the end of the Eneolithic.<br />
All three of the steppe-admixed exceptions were from the Varna region (Mathieson et al. 2018). One of them was the famous “golden man’ at Varna (Krause et al. 2016).</p>

<p>After this 4300-4200 BC event, Anatolian Farmer ancestry began to pop up in the steppes. The currently- oldest sample with Anatolian Farmer ancestry in the steppes in an individual at Aleksandriya, a Sredni Stog cemetery on the Donets in eastern Ukraine.</p>

<p>Reuniting old Anatolian Iranian CHG herders with old Anatolian European WHG farmers in EHG land.</p>

<p>In short: the closer one looks the more complicated and detailed the myriad paths of history become.</p>

<p>Pliny the Elder's Natural History (AD 77–79) derives the name of the Caucasus from the Scythian kroy-khasis = ice-shining, white with snow (cf. Greek cryos = ice-cold).</p>
