<p>Gypsies have they name from the fact that they claim to come from Egypt.<br />
Their ancestry goes back to India: Sinthi and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_people">Roma</a><br />
Thus ethnically they are grouped as indo-aryan.<br />
The Dom (also called "Doma" and "Domi"; Arabic: دومي Dūmī , دومري / Dūmrī ; Egyptian Arabic: هناجره Hanagra )<br />
they speak the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romani_language">Romani</a> language<br />
Interestingly Roman(ⲣⲱⲙⲓ) in coptic means human.</p>

<p>as they belong to the indo-european stuff we can recognise parts of that language:</p>

<p>present imperative - ker! ⇔ <a href="𓂓">𓂓</a> kar = work</p>

<p>te ker.el -to do ⇔ <a href="𓂓">𓂓</a> ⇔ kardan karman …  "takecare"  suffix -l 3rd person<br />
te <a href="Hase">ha</a>.l - to eat</p>

<p>Being an Indo-Aryan language, their <a href="Pronouns">pronouns</a> are quite European:</p>

<p>| person | singular |	plural |<br />
|--------|----|----|<br />
1.ps 	|me kerav| 	a<a href="men">men</a> keras<br />
2.ps 	|tu keres| 	tumen keren<br />
3.ps 	|jov kerel| 	jon keren</p>

<p>past tense with +d just like English or some Egyptian:<br />
past conditional - tu kerďalas (ker + <strong>d</strong> + 'al + as)</p>

<p>Romani is a free word order language[20] and that it allows for theme-rheme structure, similarly to Czech or Hebrew, and that in some Romani dialects in East Slovakia, there is a tendency to put a verb at the end of a sentence:</p>

<pre><code>Odi kuči šilaľi. - This cup is chilly(cold)  
Oda šilaľi kuči. - This is a chilly cup.  
</code></pre>

<p>A form similar to Oda acted as predecessor for our words: This, da(there), esta(is)</p>
