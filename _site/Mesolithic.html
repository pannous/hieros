<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> is underrepresented in the archological record, because permanent settlements tend to be close to the sea, which rose by over a hundred meters from 20000 BC to 6000 BC! The term Mesolithic is of very limited use because "the ages blended together like the colors of a rainbow".</p>
