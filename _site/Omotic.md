The Omotic languages are a group of languages spoken in southwestern Ethiopia, in the Omo River region and southeastern Sudan in Blue Nile State. The Geʽez script is used to write some of the Omotic languages, the Latin script for some others. 

Omotic is generally classified as belonging to the Afroasiatic language family, with some strong connections to Egyptian:

𓌳 𓄿 𓄡 𓊮 | burn | ⲙⲉϩ ⲙⲟϩ mˈičʼ- @ Omotic to burn
