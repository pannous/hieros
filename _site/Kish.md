[Kish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kish_(Sumer)) [𒆧](𒆧.html)𒆠  

First city after the flood (Nippur), maybe most important Sumerian city.  

"[King](King.html) of Kish" prestigious title came to mean:  
[šar kiššatim](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Four_Corners) ("King of Everything" or "King of the Universe")  

[Kassites](getae) probably derive their names from this legendary city. (if only in the sense of Roma deriving from Rome: by referring to former greatness)  

The names of the next Early dynastic nine kings of Kish preceding Etana are all Akkadian words for animals, e.g. Zuqaqip "**scorpion**"
