<p>𐍅 is mostly easily and correctly transcribed as W/V</p>

<p>However just like the <a href="coptic.html">coptic</a> letter ⲩ (which is wrongly transcribed as 'u') there seems to be a little bit more to it:</p>

<p>𐍅 Strange <a href="ypsilon.html">ypsilon</a> letter between <a href="Y.html">Y</a>,V,W,R,G! 𐌰𐌹𐍅=ever (𐍅:VR/WG:ⲩ) 𐌰𐌹𐍅=ewig in gothic</p>

<p>G component:</p>

<p>𐌰𐌽𐌰𐌷𐌽𐌴𐌹𐍅𐌰𐌽 	 ...neigen++	 bend down,bow<br />
𐌰𐌹𐍅=ewig/ever  (v also carried by vau/vir <a href="𐌹.html">𐌹</a> )<br />
𐍅𐌹𐌲𐌰𐌽 	 guergon/wegaron &gt; war<br />
𐍅𐍂𐌰𐍄𐍉𐌳𐌿𐍃  γrat : Wanderung (gress!)</p>

<p>R component:<br />
𐍃<a href="𐍅.html">𐍅</a>𐌹𐌽<a href="𐌸.html">𐌸</a>𐍃 ⋍ strength<br />
𐍅𐌿𐌻𐍅𐌰 	 wulwe	√Wolf ⇔ Welfen &lt;  Ruava &lt; robber</p>

<p>Vr component:<br />
𐍅𐍂𐌰𐌺𐌰 	 vraka 	Frage!   persecution<br />
𐍅𐍂𐍉𐌷𐍃 	 vrōḫs 	Frage!	 accusation</p>

<p>If there truely once was a more complicated reading it is completely (or easily) forgotten because the 'simplified' reading has become 100% our own:</p>

<p>𐍅𐌹𐌳𐌿𐍅𐍉 	 Widwe<br />
𐍅𐍉𐌺𐍂𐍃 	 Wucherei!</p>

<p>In one example 𐍅 actually corresponds to modern Y :)<br />
𐍃𐍅𐍂𐌹𐌰!	 Syria</p>
