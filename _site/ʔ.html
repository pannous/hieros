<p># ʔ ⇔ α <a href="𓃾">𓃾</a></p>

<p>According to common theory the letter <a href="alpha">aleph</a> /ˈɑːlɛf/ originally represented the glottal stop (ʔ). We proposed that this glottal stop initially had a slight dangling ‘pha’ component: pha before shifting to a slight ‘ra’ component and the later ‘a’ enunciation.</p>
