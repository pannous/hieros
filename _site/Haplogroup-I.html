<p>Indigenous Europeans,</p>

<p>Nowadays clusters in Scandinavia and The western Balkans.</p>

<p>Probably related to Finno-Ugric languages, with Hungary as an island population.</p>

<p>Ethnic and Linguistic substratum in PIE languages.</p>

<p>Mixing with Early European farmers <a href="EEF.html">EEF</a> of Anatolian Caucasian descent <a href="haplogroup g.html">haplogroup g</a>:</p>

<p>The Tisza culture is a Neolithic archaeological culture of the Alföld plain in modern-day Hungary, Western Romania, Eastern Slovakia and Ukrainian Zakarpattia Oblast in Central Europe. The culture is dated to the 5th and 4th millennia BCE. five samples of Y-DNA extracted, three belonged to G2a2b and a subclade of it, and two belonged to I2a and a subclade of it. The same mixture survives until 3100BC: Of the three samples of Y-DNA extracted, one belonged to I2a1, one belonged to I, and one belonged to G2.</p>

<p>In general surviving indigenous western hunter gatherers WHG now possess a language which is a hybrid of Germanic PIE and proto Uralic: https://github.com/pannous/hieros/blob/master/dicts/swadesh/Uralic.tsv<br />
The overlap of core vocabulary between both language families is very significant.</p>

<p>As Haplo Group I belonged to the Trans Siberian shamanic corridor, similarities to eastern Asian language families also need to be investigated.</p>

<p>A good indication for the divergence of languages are the South American languages which had a common ancestor ⋍14kya. Eurasian 'Ma' as a question particle needs to be investigated under that light. Any similarity between eastern and western Eurasian languages are better understood with the spread of the Neolithic, the associated spread of the megalithic (See especially Korea), and the later <a href="Home">spread of metallurgy, chariots, cities and kingship</a>.</p>
