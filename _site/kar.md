𒆸 KAR [KUR](KUR.html)  

𓂓 ≠ 𓊖 “Kar” is likely the most recognisable international sign cluster in the age of urbanization and syllabic writing from the 4th millennium BC. It combines a wonderword with a kind of wondersign, akin to the spread of alphabets throughout many cultures:  

𒆳 kur кайа 𒆠 ki 𔗜 ku 𜐺	KU 𐘾 ka 𐀏 KA 𑁣 керла 𔕆 •KAR 𔕈 KA 𔕇 𐀤 𐘿 QE 𐊨 ʘ q /kʷ/ Ⱆ Uku 𒉽 KUR₂ 𑀓 KA 𒄯 Ḫar 𓊖 [1] 𒃸 kár 𒃼 gar  
𓏓 𓊖 𜰸 𜰴 𒆠 perfect continuum in [Indus](Indus.html) script, though its value so far is unproven.  

It combines two similar sounding concepts, Kreuz and Kreis ([cross](cross.html) and [circle](circle.html)) or Kreuz and Karos (cross and squares) into a very persistant phonetic and logographic unit of "KAR".  

“Kar” has two main semantic meanings "[city](city.html)" and "[mountain](mountain.html)", connected through the concept of [tell](tell.html) (city-hill). Later also via extension: "country". Connections to "cold" and "stone" may be secondary or basal but not part of the logographic KAR cluster under investigation.  

𐊔 Naturally associated with the number [4](4.html) (sometimes 𐊼 [3](3.html) or [π](π.html) ), semantically via city court quarters, also supporting the "kar" root in some branches.  

Traces of this sign or its underlying wanderword can be seen on any atlas: From Novgorod via Merhgarh, Ankara, Sakkara to english courts. As with many wanderwords as part of names, this very recognizable pre-/suffix is still all too often [reanalized](reanalized.html) per instance by folk etymologies and [Bad-Linguistics](Bad-Linguistics.html).  

Representatives of Kar can have all vowels a,e,i,o,u,…, so labeling this cluster 'Kar' is somewhat arbitrary, K-R would be more fitting. For extended discussion of connections between this well defined group and other far reaching concepts see [KUR](KUR.html)!  

Representatives of Kar are visible in near all logographich systems.  

𒆳 kur 𒆠 ki 𔗜 ku 𜐺	KU 𐘾 ka 𐀏 KA 𑁣 керла 𔕆 •KAR 𔕈 KA 𔕇 𐀤 𐘿 QE 𐊨 ʘ q 𒉽 KUR₂ 𒄯 Ḫar 𓊖 [1] 𜐺 口 kǒu => 国 국 guk  

The phonetic R 𔖱 of 𔕆 KAR is often omitted in syllabic practice, reduced to 𔕈 KA, just as only the 'be' of beta (β) is used in alphabetic usage.  

Phonetics inside and outside the syllabaries were far from stable though:  
Especially words for [city](city.html) (or related signs) corroded from kar > car > šar sar > ḫar > har via common [sound-change](sound-change.html) chains. On the other hand it might have been reattached conciously to similar concepts and variants.  

[1]:  
𓊖 had probably many phonetic readings over time, but symbollically it fits the above description of Kar perfectly!!  
𓊖 does have indirect evidence for repesenting the KAR/court cluster though: 𓐍 𓋓 𓂋 𓏏 𓏏 𓀐 even if via [complement](complement.html).  
𓐍 fits phonetically but has no city connotation, unlike similar 𓊖.  
𓊨 may be an imperfect specimen without circle connotations via secondary qursi ≈ chair readings.
