The fluid term of _race_ is best redefined as clusters in genetic PCA charts. While nowadays there is a continuum between these clusters, before the onset of the Neolithic revolution, clusters were generally more distinct. Over time the genetic profiles and the associated clusters are ever mixing and shifting so that it makes little sense for modern Italians to say they belong to the Roman race. On the other hand one can find sub-clusters even in local populations, yet no one would say they belong to the Seattle race versus the Mississippi race.  

"My race" could be defined as a borderless ordered set of individuals with similar genomes modulo a given hyper dimensional metric.

At Butmir sites 72 human figures made of baked clay were found. They are made in such way so that one can easily identify some racial features. There are 3 main groups of found figures that showed racial characteristics of Negroid, Armenoid and European races.
