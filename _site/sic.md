[𓌳](𓌳) sickle  


sic erat scriptum, "thus was it written"  

inserted after a quoted word or passage indicates that the quoted matter has been transcribed exactly as found in the source text, complete with any erroneous or archaic spelling, surprising assertion, faulty reasoning, or other matter that might otherwise be taken as an error of transcription.  

Used to indicate a seeming error which might be a **semantic shift**:  

e.g. **Ham**s[ter](𓄛) 𓃹𓃺 [sic](sic) ≠ Hammel Hase
