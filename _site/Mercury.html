<h1 id="sekwi---in-job-3836">sekwi סכוי לַשֶּׂכְוִי in Job 38:36</h1>
<p>The name of Mercury, sbg.w, and due to phonetic developments later also swgȝ, is of totally unknown meaning. There is a possible connection of this name with biblical Hebrew sekwi in Job 38, 36 where the word is used in parallelism with “Ibis” in connection with wisdom, and thus is likely to have a relation to the Egyptian god Thot (probably also present in phonetic rendering in this passage), who is the counterpart of Greek Hermes and Latin Mercury (Pope, 1973, p. 302; von Lieven, 1999, p. 125, note 261). An individual note in one subtype of images of this form, especially from the Ramesside Period, should also be mentioned. It is given for Mercury and says, “Seth in the evening twilight, a god in the morning twilight” (Neugebauer &amp; Parker, 1969, p. 180). This implies that the identity of Mercury as an evening and morning star was recognized, even though he was evaluated somewhat differently from a religious perspective, depending on his phase.</p>

<p>Overall, all three outer planets are linked to different forms of the falcon-headed god Horus, especially connected with royalty. Venus is linked with his father Osiris, and Mercury with Seth, the brother, enemy, and killer of Osiris, who killed him. Given also that the Sun and Moon are masculine in Egyptian conception, this means that the moving celestial bodies are conceived exclusively as male entities in Ancient Egypt, quite in contrast to many other ancient cultures.</p>

<p>The epithets of the planets do not contain anything that gives essential and permanent characteristics for any single planet; they would be possible for any of them at certain times. Rather, they are indications of actual stages at specific moments. For reasons which cannot exactly be explained, such a depiction with ephemeral captions became codified as the classical sky image in Egypt for a very long time.</p>

<p>𓃀 𓈖 𓅣 Venus ≈ <a href="phoenix.html">phoenix</a><br />
Venus is normally called either “the phoenix bird” or “the heron bird” and linked with the god Osiris. All these beings are also attested in other contexts. Only in the Late Period is the name “the morning star” applied to her with certainty (but see “Possible Attestations of Specific Planets in Other Contexts”). She receives the epithet “the crossing star.” ϫⲓⲛⲥⲓⲛⲓ ⲙⲁⲛⲥⲓⲛⲓ •ⲓⲛⲥⲓⲛⲓ ⋍ venucin ⇔ wankel schwank : Mercury</p>
