<p>Anatolian languages were<br />
Hattian (non IE?), Hittite and Luwian, Lydian, Lycian and Palaic<br />
written in (Akkadian) cuneiform and <a href="Anatolian.html">Anatolian</a> hieroglyphs.</p>

<p>The late <a href="Turk.html">Turk</a> intrusion into Anatolia will be a case study of the correlation between genes and languages.</p>

<p>The Anatolian neolithic is dominated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Catal Hoyuk</a> (cutlery Hügel)</p>

<p>It was a very early metal-working centre, maybe a kind of gulag, with horrible hygiene and stench of smoke, fecals and dead under the floors. The system was staple however as the site was occupied for 2000 years.</p>

<p>The settlement was one of the earliest places in the world to mine and smelt metal in the form of lead, as well as cold hammering other metals.</p>

<p>Pottery and obsidian tools appear to have been major industries</p>

<p>people were "divided into two groups who lived on opposite sides of the town, separated by a gully."</p>

<h1 id="eef">EEF</h1>
<p>It is now proven that the first wave(s) of Neolithic settlers from Anatolia replaced most (95-99%) of the ancient western hunter gatherers (WHG).</p>

<p>Since a second wave, of Yamnaya <a href="PIE.html">PIE</a> origine replaced on average 50% of the first neolithic settlers, the question arises of whether layers from the first EEF wave are remnant in our languages.</p>

<h1 id="eef-language">EEF language</h1>

<p>Most important the Anatolian Early European Farmers <a href="EEF.html">EEF</a> were replaced by a 50% Caucasian <a href="CHG.html">CHG</a> influx at the beginning(!) of the copper age, leaving the European perifery in an old state. This was even before the rise of the Hittites. This admixture did NOT change until the Iron Age, at least given the limited DNA in existance. One big problem is that the Hittite elite burned their dead leaving no DNA traces. A steppe influx would still leave a mark on Hattian peasants/vassals! If this observation holds, Hittites were CHG not Steppe, meaning <a href="Yamnaya.html">Yamnaya</a> was secondary in the spread of PIE.</p>

<p>The mural wall iconography is focused on hunting scenes but the main staple were domesticated sheep.</p>

<p>It was an irrigation economy fed by the swampy Kasamba river , the dried up plain was unsuitable for farming</p>

<p>Çatalhöyük exported blades and polished mirrors made from capadocian obsidian to the vast trading network, receiving sea shells from the mediterranean, malachite beads from jordan and timber from taurus communities. turkish obsidian was found in the southern levante and iran.</p>

<p>Secondary burial and scull plastering was widespread from Turkey to Ain Gazel in PPN. One substructure in Çayönü was a repository of sculls. Large amount of non human blood poured over pile (significance? not much)<br />
Headless figures accompanied by vultures. Only very select Bodies beneath floors or within walls, see Shimao, normal bodies burned in middens or disposed otherwise (river?)</p>

<p>The 10-18% Anatolian Farmer ancestry that was widespread in <a href="Yamnaya.html">Yamnaya</a> was missed in the earliest applications of whole genome analysis 2015. This signature is different from the earlier Anatolian Iranian CHG ancestry which came over the eastern caucasus ⋍6000 BC</p>

<p>If contact with the <a href="Maikop.html">Maikop</a> culture was a fundamental cause of the innovations in transport and metallurgy that defined the <a href="Yamnaya.html">Yamnaya</a> culture, then the lower Don-North Caucasus-lower Volga steppes, closest to the North <a href="Caucasus.html">Caucasus</a>, would be where the earliest phase is expected.</p>

<p>Anatolia received hardly any genetic input from Europe or the Eurasian steppe from the Chalcolithic to the Iron Age<br />
. This contrasts with Southeastern Europe and Armenia that were impacted by major gene flow from Yamnaya steppe pastoralists. <a href="https://anthrogenica.com/showthread.php?26280-quot-The-Genetic-History-of-the-Southern-Arc-A-Bridge-between-West-Asia-amp-Europe-quot" title="The Genetic History of the Southern Arc: A Bridge between West Asia &amp; Europe">David Reich 2022</a></p>

<p>"In the Balkans, we reveal a patchwork of Bronze Age populations with diverse proportions of steppe ancestry in the aftermath of the ⋍3000 BCE Yamnaya migrations, paralleling the linguistic diversity of Paleo-Balkan speakers. We provide insights into the Mycenaean period of the Aegean by documenting variation in the proportion of steppe ancestry (including some individuals who lack it altogether), and finding no evidence for systematic differences in steppe ancestry among social strata, such as those of the elite buried at the Palace of Nestor in Pylos.</p>

<p>A striking signal of steppe migration into the Southern Arc is evident in Armenia and northwest Iran where admixture with Yamnaya patrilineal descendants occurred, coinciding with their 3rd millennium BCE displacement from the steppe itself. This ancestry, pervasive across numerous sites of Armenia of ⋍2000-600 BCE, was diluted during the ensuing centuries to only a third of its peak value, making no further western inroads from there into any part of Anatolia, including the geographically adjacent Lake Van center of the Iron Age Kingdom of Urartu. The impermeability of Anatolia to exogenous migration contrasts with our finding that the Yamnaya had two distinct gene flows, both from West Asia, suggesting that the Indo-Anatolian language family originated in the eastern wing of the Southern Arc and that the steppe served only as a secondary staging area of Indo-European language dispersal. The demographic significance of Anatolia on a Mediterranean-wide scale is further documented by our finding that following the Roman conquest, the Anatolian population remained stable and became the geographic source for much of the ancestry of Imperial Rome itself."</p>
