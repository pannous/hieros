# Bad Linguistics

Opposite of [Good Linguistics](Good-Linguistics)  

Bad Linguists speak of certainty and impossibilities, when in truth most etymology is a question of probability and plausibility. As with many Arabic words, etymology is often obscure, because in clusters with dozens or hundreds of related words it can be impossible to reconstruct the earliest original form(s).  

No absolute truth outside mathematics  
Everything in linguistics outside the realm of epistemological corpora is conjection and surjection.  

In general Linguists often have very strong opinions on very weak evidence which leads to lots of unnecessary toxidity and confident rejections of facts:  

Laryngeal Theory was **savagely attacked** by many leading linguists of the time, including some seniorfaculty members of the Leipzig University, which was the acknowledged leader in Indo-European linguistics studies in 19th century.  Because of this rejection,the theory was more or less forgotten for the next fifty years.  

Linear B was universally 'proven' to be non-IE … until it was proven to be old greek.  

Todo: remove polemics.  

# Cautious is not bad

Linguists have good reason to be very cautious about putative etymologies: Some words exhibit such a complicated history that any '(un)educated guesses' or phonetic alignment would surely lead to completely wrong conclusions: Take the word lord<lourde<lowerd<louerd,loverd,laford<lhoaverd<hlāford < hlāfweard :  hlāf “bread” + weard “guardian” : loaf-warden if you will. Without historic background any etymology would certainly be misguided, the correct derivation impossible to guess.  

There is a gradient between words which [possibly should be connected](missing-connections) on wiktionary, but are left out because of doubt and words which should be connected but are actively rejected because of dubious arguments and "formal difficulties".  

Therefore if two similar words in related languages have different but similar reconstructed roots, as is the case with flow and fluō (Latin), instead of writing "not cognate" the correct formulation should be 'not a proven cognate', or specified thus:  

'flow' is not cognate with Latin fluō despite similarity, UNLESS the PIE roots *plew- “to fly, flow”, *bʰlewH- “to overflow” and or *bʰleh₁- “to swell, blow” are themselves related.  

For example the words for [shame](shame.html):  

Linguists seem to have forgotten the messy nature of language and now reject the most likely (if not obvious) cognates / loanwords due to "formal difficulties":  

αἶσχος aἶskos “shame”  
𐌰𐌹𐍅𐌹𐍃𐌺𐌹 aiviski “shame”  

شرم • šarm शर्म śarma 𐭱𐭥𐭬 (šarm) from Avestan 𐬟𐬱𐬀𐬭𐬆𐬨𐬀 fšarəma shame  
shame sharm Scar.mak Schaden scar.done scar.do hurt  
شرم • šarm shame (⇔harm ok, but shame not lil)  

სირცხვილი sircxvili  
耻辱 chǐrǔm shame ( perhaps;)  

Same with κάπρος caper gabor gafr hæfer (⋍goat)  

"there is no way to unite *k with *g or *p with *b."  

Insanity! The basic sound shifts 101-Linguistics are forgotten?  

Have they lost their mind? Next they proof that cockroach and Kackerlake can't possibly be related due to "formal difficulties".  

At least they connect αἰδέομαι aishame with ashamed ( but probably not because of the [demi](demi.html)/semi nature of δ (dh⋍th⋍s) )  

The vulgar reading αίσχος aíschos is even identical to the German 'aisch'.  

ajá, ožỹs, αἴξ, ayc ‘goat’ cannot be reconstructed as PIE √h2eiǵ- … or *aiǵ-, a form that violates PIE phonology in two different ways:  
1) it starts with a vowel and 2) it contains **a.  

The complete absurdity  of  proposing  a  language  with just  one  vowel ('a' not included) is thankfully recognized by   eminent  Polish  linguist  Witold  Manczak.  


# directionality
The focus on directionality is often misguided, for example in the lack of contemporary old Proto-Germanic documents it's near impossible to say whether a term entered Germanic from Latin or the other way round.  

Absurdly linguists declared 'sabbat' the root and explain dozens of variants with 'm' [sambet](sambet.html) as nazalized(?) derivations.  

crypt κρυπτή (kruptḗ), female form of the adjective κρυπτός (kruptós)

[Good-Linguistics](Good-Linguistics.html) treats both forms equivalently

```  
Celtic and Germanic isoglosses are a priori suspect, because there was no independ- ent Germano-Celtic proto-language; similarities between the two branches can only indicate one of the following three relations: 1) Indo-European archaisms that were coincidentally preserved in Germanic and Celtic only; 2) borrowing from Celtic into Germanic or vice versa, and 3) shared contact with a third lan- guage.  
```  
What does "no independent Germano-Celtic proto-language" even mean? No subbranch of PIE which influenced Germanic and Celtic languages? No people in Europe before the Romans? He should get his mental model about the colonization of Europe and the constant hybridization of languages right.

Hieroglyphic [name](name.html)s are **not** suitable for language familiy identification!  
Apart from [Phono-semantic matching](Phono-semantic matching.html), because of lacking vowels there is just too much leeway, given a few consonants!  

Claiming a name is "purely Akkadian" when there is infinite insecureity in the pronunciation:  
𒉌𒉌𒅖𒈠𒉌   Ili-ishmani (𒉌𒉌𒅖𒈠𒉌 i3-li2-isz-ma-ni) was a ruler of Elam around 2200 BCE. ("purely Akkadian name")

# Onomatopoeia everywhere
Though there is no doubt that onomatopoeia forms a fundamental part of human speech, what linguists often overlook is that there are hundreds of plausibile sounds connected to entities. In the example of cow its "moo, boo, hoo, …, …".  
So if neigboring languages use similar words for animals, onomatopoeia is no carte blanche to dismiss relatedness.  
Point in case: [bull](bull.html)  
If the whole planet uses different sounds to describe an object and two neigboring languages use “pop” there is a high chance that these two “pop” are related, onomatopoetic or not.  
The question of onomatopoeia is orthogonal to the question of relatedness!  

# Bad Egyptology

## Premature identification

In the past some mistakes were made by premature identification of alternate signs in words with the same (or similar) meanings, e.g. :  

Two words for sky  
sky 𓊪 𓏏 𓇯  
sky 𓁷 𓏏 𓇯  
may lead to an unwary identification of 𓁷 as 𓊪. This should never be done since it is possible that these are completely different words that just happen to have a final (middle?) 𓏏 :  

𓇯       sky, heaven  
𓊪 𓏏 𓇯       sky, heaven  
𓁷 𓏏 𓇯       sky, heaven  
𓁷 𓂋 𓏏 𓇯     sky, heaven  
𓄿 𓂋 𓏏 𓇯     heaven, sky  

This kind of identification is however rampant in the reconstruction of phonetic sign values, often because we just dont have the phonetic value for many extra alphabetic signs and [determinants](determinants.html) , which value was usually assumed to be known and rarly spelled out, e.g.  
𓋁 𓊡 east wind was known to represent the longer form 𓋁 𓃀 𓏏 𓊡  ( ⇔ [wind](wind.html) [bend](bend.html) [levante](levante.html) )  

Similarily, permutations may represent different states, stages, variants or branches of a root,  
e.g. ‘earth’ and ‘acres’:  
𓎛 𓄿 𓏏 𓈅 𓏥        fields, arable lands, earth, mould hearth  
𓄿 𓎛 𓏏 𓈇          field, arable land, earth, mound    ahert  

even though words can have very similar meanings, if they are written differently, there is a high chance that they were infact different branches and instances on the language tree:  
𓅱 𓊪 𓄋 open  
𓄋 𓊪 𓏴 separate  

Concluding 𓅱 = 𓄋 “w” would be very wrong  

# Upward sound change
In by far the most cases [sound-change](sound-change.html) happens from high entropy to low entropy.  
osteo < 𒄩𒀀𒀸𒊭   /ḫāssa/ bone  *h₃ésth₁ < Кость < 𓈎 𓋴 𓌟 qʳstwo  
If an upstream word appears in the tree of related cognates, it has to be taken as a root form!  
Especially if it is explicitly attested in the historic record (as is the case with Кость < 𓈎 𓋴 𓌟 qʳstwo )  

Bad Linguistics violate the nature of downward sound change too often, for the sake of their own cute frameworks and theories.

# Corruption
Often the reconstruction of words is too conservative:
when the corroded reconstruction of a word results in a sequence of vowels, one should consider longer variants:

Despite 𒀀 a/mû/bu4 being within the realms of the [wildcard-fallacy](wildcard-fallacy.html), one should consider all forms based on it:

𒀀𒅇𒀀;𒀀𒄷𒋛𒀀  a-u₃-a;a-u5-a a'u'a ferryman veerman (𒀀 mû mein ≈ man ) מַעְבּוֹרַאי ma'aborai  
𒀀𒉺𒄐𒉻𒋛𒀀  au  towman  towman of a boat  a'u A-PA-GISAL-PAD-SI-A > apgi'l'osio  #āgilu   
𒀀𒌑;𒀀𒅇;𒀀𒄷𒋛;𒅇;𒄷𒋛  a-u₂;a-u₃;a-u5;u₃;u5  high water  a'u over ≠ Ebbe  hyper ≈ hygh hoch(wasser)  

[father](father.html)
The reconstruction of 'father' 𓇋 𓏏 𓆑 𓀀 as #jt is absurd, given longer forms are known 
𓇋 𓏏 𓆑 𓀀 | father | ⲓⲟϯ eiōt aita @ [basque](basque.html) ⇔ Eidam Adam Alter, Eltern vs 𒇻 UTU≈aita
𓇋 𓏏 𓆑 𓀀 | father | ⲓⲟϯ eiōt aita <> ᚺᚨᛁᛏᛖ haite 𐌷𐌰𐌹𐍄𐌰𐌽 haitan heissen father-names bin …
𓇋 𓏏 𓆑 𓀀 | father | [π](π.html)ⲓⲟϯ ↔ ⲓⲱⲧ (p)eiōt (p)eiote < Pjotre  

The Coptic form is corroded so that it hides the 𓆑 ƒ component of father, however ommiting it in reconstructions is a big faux-pas, even if very common:
𜎼𜎅𜏧 ᵛAtta father (𜎼 VA < PA 𓊪 )
𐌰𐍄𐍄𐌰 Vatta ( not atta! see [𐌰](𐌰.html) [alpha](alpha.html) and [alphabetic-change](alphabetic-change.html)  )  

# Lost Consonants
Bad Linguists failed to recognize the semi-vocalic character of the Coptic alphabet. Leading to very corrupt readings missing the nature of words:
𓇳 𓇶 ⲟⲩⲱⲓⲛⲓ •ˢoᵞᶴwinī ≈ ᵒrawšanī  see [ⲩ](ⲩ.html) [ⲱ](ⲱ.html) אוֹרָה orá shine "light"
