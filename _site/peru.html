<p>Many boats must have reached the Americas from China, mostly dead sailors, but some of them must have been alive and carried knowledge of advanced 'western' <a href="home">civilization</a>. This becomes evident in the (globally) late and sudden arrival of technologies such as metallurgy,  writing and ceramics without any local prescedence in America after 3500 BC. The best example of such a sudden introduction is the <a href="pyramid.html">pyramid</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caral">Caral</a>, roughly contemporary with Egyptian, Iranian, Indian and <a href="china">Chinese</a> pyramids. No doubt that any early expeditions arriving on such remote locations on earth quickly developed into local cultures and merged with the indiginous so that any genetic evidence must be confined to early tombs. We are very excited to await such DNA analysis and, if some dozen elite tombs will reveal zero Asian/Egyptian anchestry, accept the refutation of this theory.</p>

<p>The Gilgamesh epos gives a beautiful glimpse into the age in which exploring the planet was still a very fresh discipline.</p>

<p>The 8000 year old practice of cold hammering copper also reached northern America very early albeit through a very different route, namely from the north east, creating a complex around the great lakes after 5000-4000BC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Copper_Complex transforming from tools to ornament by 1000BC</p>
