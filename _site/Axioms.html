<p>Linguistic axioms<br />
* There is a high (but not perfect) correlation between languages and genes<br />
* Paleogenetic and modern data will yield hints towards language developments.<br />
* The 'tree' metaphor for languages is inadequate and should be replaced with modern 'flow' theories.<br />
* There are different kinds of relatedness, all denoted by '<a href="&gt;.html">&gt;</a>' here<br />
* The exact nature of <a href="relatedness.html">relatedness</a> between Egyptian words and modern reflections is (almost) never certain.<br />
* If words from the same language family look similar on the surface they are most likely related:<br />
*   even if the reconstructions seem to be divergent on first examination.<br />
* If words from language families with historic close contact look similar on the surface they are likely <a href="relatedness">connected</a><br />
*   if only through <a href="phono-semantic-matching.html">phono-semantic-matching</a><br />
* enforcement: if a native community has several synonyms, foreign communities influence and repeatedly select the word which has the closest perceived relative in their native language. sheriff (shire + reeve) ‚áî sharif Might be an example<br />
* <a href="opposites.html">opposites</a> are often related, because in a orthogonal semantic dimension they are identical (<a href="guest.html">guest</a>‚áîhost ‚Ä¶)<br />
* many things can be understood just using the <a href="Alphabet">Alphabet</a><br />
*  words connected with those letters were hyper conserved (changed very little)<br />
* words connected with the alphabet formed conserving, re-converging clusters<br />
* words connected with those signs underwent <a href="alphabetic-change.html">alphabetic-change</a><br />
* For many <a href="Gardinger-signs">Gardinger signs</a> we use some different readings, based on the corpus and rules of <a href="determinant.html">determinant</a>s<br />
* The phonetic readings reconstructed are an echo of a more complicated history<br />
* By its very nature the pronunciation can always only be a cluster approximation<br />
* Any 'precise' vocalisation of Egyptian is complete speculation and bears no authority.<br />
* Any linguistic method or argument relying precise vocalisation is invalid<br />
* Large scale comparisons and <a href="cluster analysis.html">cluster analysis</a> akin to universal <a href="sound-change.html">sound-change</a> are valid<br />
* Connecting individual words outside <a href="Coptic.html">Coptic</a> remains thus forever tentative<br />
* On the other hand tentatively <a href="relatedness">connecting</a> individual words outside <a href="Coptic.html">Coptic</a> cannot be dismissed via 'formal arguments' but should be subject to historic plausibility.<br />
* Most <a href="Gardinger-signs">Gardinger signs</a> assumed to be silent receive a pronounciation.<br />
* <a href="Determinants">Determinants</a> often had a vocalisation which was optional: akin to New York (city).<br />
* Puns and the rebus principle lead to wrong etymologies<br />
* This kind of wrong etymology is a true etymology in the sense of <a href="relatedness">influence</a><br />
* Confusion of signs lead to wrong readings<br />
* After centuries of consistent wrong readings, they become true, if adapted by the populous<br />
* Ambivalent readings can be both correct<br />
* The ultimate reading of some gardener signs is not fully determined<br />
* Once a European connection is accepted, European suggestions are allowed Pyr‚áîFire <a href="ìçë">ìçë</a><br />
* Most letters had a full (original) reading and an alphabetic one<br />
* The vowels where mostly lost, the consonants blurred out ìèè Delle=tell ìèèìèè dad=tit ìèè dough=Teig<br />
* Some signs had different associated entities<br />
* All <em>phonetic</em> readings should be understood as instantiations of binomial cluster distributions<br />
* Combinging these distributions can lead to a <a href="wildcard fallacy.html">wildcard fallacy</a>] {one sign generating all}<br />
* In two related languages if two words sound similar they are <em>probably</em> related somehow<br />
* The alignment of one word alone is rarely evidence enough<br />
* The alignment of whole <a href="mutual-evidence">clusters</a> of words can be prove<br />
* Deus, Theus and Zeus are related period. Anyone who thinks differently must stop reading<br />
* The Egyptian language and <a href="Grammar">Grammar</a> is rather simple.<br />
* Over the course of three millenia, most universal <a href="sound changes.html">sound changes</a> did occur<br />
* Many signs exhibited a quantum state: the reading would flip with the context. Two completly different but harmonious readings might have occasionally occured.<br />
* After the last dynasty the Egyptian system was already riddled with ambiguities, corruption, confusion and dialectic readings, not just in the modern meaning but truely literally dialectic (see <a href="Sumerian.html">Sumerian</a> signs).</p>

<p>The reconstructed <a href="Alphabet.html">Alphabet</a> is the most crucial part of Egyptology<br />
We mostly follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration_of_Ancient_Egyptian#Table_of_transliteration_schemes">conventional reading</a> of the letters<br />
With some minor shifts and with the exception of<br />
'v' letters:  <a href="ìáã">ìáã</a> as fE, ìç¢ìÖ± as w…ô with dangling 'on', <a href="ìÜë">ìÜë</a> as vhe or <a href="wildcard-fallacy">œÜhethn</a></p>
