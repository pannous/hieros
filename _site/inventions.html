Bronze Age on wikipedia is inprecise/outdated:<br />
Arsenic bronzes started earlier and in Anatolia, Caucasus, the Balkans.</p>

<p>Cold copper working was already part of the early European farmers before they reached the Danube <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Copper_Complex">and beyond</a></p>

<p>The dating of inventions is very tentative, a 'first' find might point to the general region, later broad adoption of an invention can be distant from its origin. Also there are often many stages of an invention, as becomes evident in the development of strings and ropes, which first occurred naturally and later were refined by thicker and thicker multi-plyed strings into proper cords. Interestingly hemp ropes reached China only 2800 BC!   A similar multi step development of clay vessels, fired clay and proper ceramics is much easier to trace because of the durability of clay objects.</p>

<p>Archaic inventions are those that predate mankind: Singing, poking and building can already be observed in other animals;</p>

<p>One of the most important invention of mankind: bow-and-arrow is archeologically hard to distinguish from other arrow techniques, such as pygmy blow arrows. Arrowheads first appeared 70k BP in South Africa, 48k BP Sri Lanka, and became global after the last glacial. 9000 BC well preserved Holmegaard <a href="bow.html">bow</a> in Denmark.</p>

<p>Before the rise of the <a href="home">Brotherhood of Copper Kings</a>, the early farmers spread their culture, technology and inventions within well connected networks, here dubbed International Farming Society, sometimes the Megaliths.</p>

<p>some people ate starchy plants more than 100,000 years ago.  Eating roots, tubers and grains might have initialized the upper paleolithic.<br />
humans have more copies of the gene that produces enzymes to digest starch than do any of our primate relatives. “Humans have up to 20 copies, and chimpanzees have 2,” plants were popular among Neanderthals too. humans were cooking and eating carbs almost as soon as they could light fires.</p>

<p>Agricultural and Proto-Agricultural Eras</p>

<p>The end of the Last Glacial Period ("ice age") and the beginning of the Holocene around 11.7 ka coincide with the Agricultural Revolution, marking the beginning of the agricultural era, which persisted until the industrial revolution.</p>

<p>Neolithic and Late Mesolithic</p>

<p>During the Neolithic period, lasting 8400 years, stone remained the predominant material for toolmaking, although copper and arsenic bronze were developed towards the end of this period.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Neolithic villages like Hureyra were housing a few hundred people at most, but perhaps the largest collection of people permanently living in one place anywhere at that time.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Abu Hureyra obtained food by hunting, fishing, and gathering of wild plants. Gazelle was hunted primarily during the summer, when vast herds passed by the village during their annual migration.[4]:41-42 These would probably be hunted communally, as mass killings also required mass processing of meat, skin, and other parts of the animal. The huge amount of food obtained in a short period was a reason for settling down permanently: it was too heavy to carry and would need to be kept protected from weather and pests.</p>

<p>Other prey included large wild animals such as onager, sheep, and cattle, and smaller animals such as hare, fox, and birds, which were hunted throughout the year. Different plant species were collected, from three different eco-zones within walking distance (river, forest, and steppe). Plant foods were also harvested from "wild gardens" with species gathered including wild cereal grasses such as einkorn wheat, emmer wheat, and two varieties of rye.[4]:41 Several large stone tools for grinding grain were found at the site.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-60867-w">12.8 ka Hureyra was hit by a comet</a></p>

<p>It was during the intentional sowing of cereals in more favorable refuges like Mureybet that these first farmers developed domesticated strains during the centuries of drought and cold of the Younger Dryas. When the climate abated about 9500 BCE they spread all over the Middle East with this new bio-technology, and Abu Hureyra grew to a large village eventually with several thousand people.</p>

<p>There was considerable overlap between the development status as even today there are hunter gatherer societies.<br />

<p>List of tools, <a href="paleolithic-inventions">inventions and techniques before the Neolithic</a>:<br />
natural medicine, trade, long-distance transportation, obsidian, pigments, projectile points, stone-tipped projectile weapons, Glue, Clothing, Heat treating, Beads, paints, Funerals, burial, Toys, Harpoons, Beds, Artistic markings, Symbolism, counting, arrows, bow-and-arrow, needle, Weirs, traps, Digging tools, wood-working tools, Instruments: sticks, wood-drum, Instruments: didgeridoo &lt; proto-flutes, flutes, Ground stone tools, AXE (different uses: weapon, tree cutting, wood-working), mines, Domestication (animal friends), Mortar and pestle, Weaving, Star chart, Rope, Instruments: Bullroarer, flute, strings. Phallus, Figurines, Ceramics, Pottery, Dentistry, Stone-dagger, gourds</p>

<p>A good albeit not pure picture can be learned from observing Adaman and pygmy cultures with relatively little external influx. One has to note though that however primitive these cultures may appear, they might have adopted many of their tools recently over the last millennia.</p>

The oxen-driven plow and local bronze-working reached Helladic cultures only about 2650BC in Early Helladic II (EHII)!<br />
monumental architecture and fortifications, though first appeared 7000BC (?) spread in EHII.<br />
apsidal houses, terracotta anchors, shaft-hole hammer-axes, ritual tumuli, and intramural burials precede the EHIII<br />
Middle Helladic period (or MH), c. 2000 BC – c. 1550 BC, was a period of cultural retrogression,</p>
