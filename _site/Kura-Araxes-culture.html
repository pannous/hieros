<p>Metallurgy</p>

<p>In the earliest phase of the Kura–Araxes culture and Sioni group, metal was scarce. In comparison, the preceding Leilatepe culture's metalwork tradition was far more sophisticated.[21] very early metal objects have been discovered in layers of the Neolithic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulaveri-Shomu_culture">Shulaveri-Shomutepe-culture</a></p>

<p>The Kura–Araxes culture would later display "a precocious metallurgical development, which strongly influenced surrounding regions".[22] They worked copper, arsenic, silver, gold,[3] tin, and bronze.[17]</p>

<p>Their metal goods were widely distributed, from the Volga, Dnieper and Don-Donets river systems in the north to Syria and Palestine in the south and Anatolia in the west.</p>

<p>Earlier: 6000BC The relationship of Hassuna pottery to that of Jericho(!) suggests that village culture was becoming widespread. Rapid development from earliest pottery 7000BC (in Khabur, and northern Iraq) to metallurgy!</p>

<p>After a first invention phase in the 6th(!?) and the 5th millennium with a comparatively limited<br />
use of metals and ores (Kawtaradze 2001) their use slightly increased in the 1st half of the 4th<br />
millennium, in east Georgia but also in Azerbaijan Kura valley we find first metallurgical<br />
inventions that became so common later during this millennium (in general: Courcier 2014:<br />
623-636; Gambashidze et all. 2010). First heavy metal tools also occurred (e.g. a Mesopotamian<br />
shaft-hole axe from Orchosani) and first arsenical bronzes and Nickel rich bronzes as well as<br />
first precious metals such as gold and silver (Courcier 2014; Gambashidze et all. 2010). It is<br />
certainly not by mere chance that these metallurgical innovations were in line with others (chaff<br />
tempered, brownish wares, and “wheel turned” pottery of Uruk/Leilatepe style: in general<br />
recently summarizing: Helwing 2012). They produced a larger amount of copper and arsenical-copper<br />
artefacts and especially also metallurgical implements like crucibles and moulds. These finds<br />
are parallel to 4 th millennium technical ceramic that is well known in a large area between the<br />
Upper Euphrates, Northern Mesopotamia and the Iranian plateau (recently Helwing 2012). Best<br />
examples for this metallurgical tradition were recently discovered by T. Akhundov at the site<br />
of Alkhantepe: Several moulds, crucibles and interestingly also litharge strongly remind on<br />
parallels from Tappeh Ghabrestan (Majidzadeh 1979; recently the finds: Stöllner et all. 2004)<br />
or Arisman (Helwing 2010) 2 . As recently Helwing (2012) and Ivanova (2012) have underlined,<br />
there might have been direct connections that especially contributed to the rising metallurgical<br />
tradition at the beginning of the 4 th millennium in the Lesser Caucasian regions. And as the<br />
graves of Seh Girdan in North-Iran indicated even a long time ago: these contacts had several<br />
facets and were vice-verse (Muscarella 1969; 1972). It is therefore rather likely to hypothesize<br />
the introduction of technical knowledge by specialists alongside the large river streams of Kura<br />
and Araxes to the Lesser Caucasian highlands.<br />
In contrast it is astonishing that metal from second half of the 4 th millennium is not as abundant<br />
as one might expect especially in the archaeological record; one is surprised how little the<br />
amount of metals in the archaeological record is.</p>

<p>The difference between metal-rich Maykop and the metal-poor Transcaucasian Kura-Araxes in the later 4 th millennium does certainly not mirror their actual metallurgical activities but rather their ritual practice with<br />
metals (Chernykh 1992: 73; in a similar sense in regard of gold: Japaridze 2013, 13).<br />
From the time around 3000 BC and the first half of the 3 rd millennium BC we earn more than<br />
ten times as many metal objects as in the 2 nd half of the 4 th millennium, coinciding with the appearance of kurgans.</p>

<p>Interpretation: Southern Caucasus was either a backwash island missing out on new innovations, a nation focused on wine production, or a raw-material producing provincial colony for the elites of Maykop and the South-East.</p>

<p>It is interesting that the next wave of<br />
precious metals (gold, silver and tin-bronze as well) appeared at the end of the 4 th mill. BC: most<br />
of the time these were spiral-rings “Locken-/Schläfenringe”, a type that interconnects many<br />
societies especially in the 3 rd millennium as a symbol (Primas 1995); spiral-rings of this shape<br />
are not known from the Near East but there is a considerable concentration in Transcaucasia<br />
(Fig. 7-8, see also catalogue), in the North Caucasus and furthermore in <em>Eurasia</em> and <strong>East Europe</strong><br />
(Primas 1995).</p>

<p>These golden items stood obviously at the beginning(!) of a longer lasting tradition<br />
that had its climax with the Kurgan graves of the Martkopi-Bedeni stage in later Early Bronze<br />
Age and at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age: it is interesting to see that – although many<br />
more expressions of social and ritual significance were added to the graves (adornment plates,<br />
discs, needles) later on – the spiral rings were still in use during that period.</p>

<p>It is rather striking that most of metal that were found in graves had more a symbolic<br />
than a functional use.</p>

<p>In Racha-region <strong>Antimony</strong> was won for the first time.</p>
