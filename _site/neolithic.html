<p>The neolithic is often defined in Russia as the age of pottery, in other parts as the phase of sedentary agricultural societies.</p>

<p>Many millenia after <strong>pottery</strong> was <a href="neolithic-inventions">invented</a> in East Asia, it made it's way to the Neolithic Revolution of the Middle East (probably via the Volga - Sibera corridor). <a href="ìÉü">ìÉü</a></p>

<p>A few thousand years after the onset of agriculture in the fertile crescent the neolithic revolution <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistoric_Egypt#Neolithic">reached Egypt</a> about the same time as Europe:</p>

<p>The period from 9000 to 6000 BC has left very little in the way of archaeological evidence.<br />

 Around 6000 BC, Neolithic settlements appear all over Egypt.[19] Studies based on morphological,[20] genetic,[21][22][23][24][25] and archaeological data[16][26][27][28][29] have attributed these settlements to migrants from the Fertile Crescent in the Near East returning during the Egyptian and North African Neolithic, bringing agriculture to the region. Weaving is evidenced for the first time during the Faiyum A Period. People of this period, unlike later Egyptians, buried their dead very close to, and sometimes inside, their settlements.</p>

<p>Thank God Wikipedia now stopped describing it as a nonsense 'independent development'.<br />
Hopefully in the coming years all other so-called independent developments will be corrected as technological transfer.</p>

<p>Especially the introduction of the Neolithic package in the Ethiopian highlands, the Sahel, and West Africa about the same time.</p>

<p>The Early Neolithic people mostly carried Haplogroups G2 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_H_(Y-DNA)">H</a></p>

New genetic shows that the migration of agriculturalists from the Middle East reached Europe via Anatolia and mostly replaced old indiginous strains. Only rarely did pottery spread to stone-age cultures in a non-disruptive way:<br />

<p>Eventually the culture was overtaken by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corded_Ware_culture">Corded Ware culture</a> and Globular Amphora culture.</p>

<p>The copper kings reached Egypt in the Maadi culture of Lower Egypt with strong connections to the southern Levant,<br />
The Badarian culture of middle Egypt (‚ãç4200BC!) and <a href="Naqada.html">Naqada</a> of Upper Egypt with strong connections to Mesopotamia and Iran, while the Fayum A culture was considerably less agricultural and was still Neolithic in nature</p>

<p>The Badarian culture produced very high quality blacktop-ware. This pottery is vital to the dating of Predynastic Egypt. Because all dates for the Predynastic period are tenuous at best.</p>
