To understand the development of the first dynasties in Egypt one needs to understand the Mesopotamian Ubaid phenomena, the developments in [Susa](Susa.html) and [Mehrgarh](Mehrgarh.html) and the subsequent [Eridu](Eridu.html) and [Uruk](Uruk.html) periods.  

Contrary to early narratives, the Ubaid 0 culture(s) seems to have developed mainly from older Halaf and Hassuna cultures with special importance to the local stratigraphy of Tell Brak, Zaidan and Gawra. It is paramount to distinguish the multiple Ubaid phenomena which expressed (super)regional features that were shared with different regions of the Ubaid horizon(s):  

* **Stamp seals** from Anatolia to Tell Bakun _excluding_ southern Mesopotamia!  
* Ophidian **figurines** in southern Mesopotamia and western Iran _absent_ in Syria.  
* **Tattoos** and **scaring**: data too scarce, customs may be reflected in figurines.  
* Body ornaments: **beads**, flanged **disks** (earrings?), **labrets** proven lip tokens  
* **Head-shaping** cranial modifications: Levante tradition different to new Iranian circumferential type  
* **Clay nails, mullers, sickles**  
* **burial** practices (sitting, extended) communal cemeteries replace in-house ancestors, later individualized  
* **Tripartite** houses selectively adapted into older Anatolian traditions.  
* Niced and buttressed public **buildings** [𓊅](𓊅.html) later very prominent in Egypt [𓀨](𓀨.html)  
* Cooking habits: **hearth** inside, **oven** outside  
* **Feasting** / Serving: clear **guest - host** architecture with hidden rooms  
* **Storage**: pottery in the south, more perishable fabrics in the north  
* Local **pottery** styles: Hajji Mohammad exclusively Ubaid 1-3 in the south  
* Pottery types: pot, bowl, beaker, basin, pouring jar, globular storage jar, tripod(!)  
* **Lithic** extraction/fabrication/import: flint from rivers, obsidian from far trade, complex patterns  
* Lithic artifacts: cores, blades, **scrapers, piercers, borers, burin, notch, chopper, hook, hoe, pick,** rod, debris, denticulates  
* Weapons: mostly absent except a few **arrow heads** in Ras Shamra III and Kenan Tepe (hunting)  
* Beginning of **secondary products** revolution: meat before milk before wool (age ratio of sheep)  
* tabular **scrapers** from Sinai / Negev as butchering / shearing knives?  
* **Spindle whorls** getting smaller ⇨ finer fabrics  
* Wool sheep after the Chalcolithic, clearly distinguished type in 3000 BC text  
* **Workshops**: distinguished work areas (pottery in Tell Shamali…)  
* **Flail** [𓋾](𓋾.html)[𓌅](𓌅.html) and crown [𓋑](𓋑.html) on figurine king markers (only part NOT whitened ⇔ [𓋔](𓋔.html))  
* [Swastika](Swastika.html) on Samarra bowls and Tell-i Bakun figurines  
* copper sun disks as [amu](amun)lets in [susa](susa.html)
