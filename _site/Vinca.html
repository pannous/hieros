<p>After neolithic settlers conquered Europe via Anatolia about 6500BC, something special happened in the Danube region: To the Neolithic technology stack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe">Göbekli Tepe</a> and Jericho and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%87atalh%C3%B6y%C3%BCk">Çatalhöyük</a>, cast copper technology and proto-writing were added or developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vin%C4%8Da_culture">Vinca</a> and related cultures, which set of a whole new level of <a href="Home">urbanisation</a>.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that Vinca proto-writing and all subsequent systems were inspired by pottery symbols from China. The invention of pottery in east Asia ⋍20000 years ago reached the Near East an Europe very late in pre-history: Only about 7500 BC via the Don river! Or it was part of the paleolithic tool box:</p>

<p>Japanese Jomon pottery (dated back to 13,000 years ago) and Middle Nile Egyptian vessels (from about 10,000 years ago) used open firing techniques.</p>

<p>First proto-writing in western Eurasia:<br />

<p>Interestingly much of this «infant civilisation» has been replaced some centuries later by their 70% technology-only-descendants from <a href="Varna.html">Varna</a>, <a href="Yamnaya.html">Yamnaya</a> and <a href="Maykop.html">Maykop</a> as evidenced by their R1b genes, replacing much of the ancient G2 gene pool.</p>

<p>Only 2000 years later do symbols of equal complexity reappear <a href="Home">synchronously</a> in Sumeria and Egypt, possibly transmitted through the <a href="Maykop">Maykop</a> culture. Such a persistence in time and space of a tradition or idea Is Not Unusual in history. It is most likely that the system lived on on perishable materials and those bark/textile <em>receipts</em> were just never hammered into stone until 3000BC.</p>

<p>The only proto-writing symbols that are older than the Vinca symbols are<br />

<p>However these symbols, which may go back to pan-Russian shamanism and cave painting, are less sophisticated then the Vinca symbols.<br />
True writing in <a href="china">China</a> appears much later, about 1200BC, in a very advanced form, most likely via the <a href="Andronovo">Andronovo</a> or <a href="Oxus">Oxus</a>/BMAC cultures. See the <a href="China">Anau seal</a> as a central piece of evidence.</p>

<p>See <a href="Samara.html">Samara</a> culture as an Asian intermediate!</p>
