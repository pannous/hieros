Starting as earliest known Neolithic outposts:  
The rectangular houses of Merghah as well as the female figurines are essentially identical with those of the Near East.[11] around 7000 BCE, the full set of Near Eastern incipient agricultural products can be found: wheat, barley, as well as goats, sheep and cattle.  

COPPERS before HARAPPA INDUS VALLEY!  
The oldest known example of the lost-wax technique comes from a 6,000-year-old copper, wheel-shaped amulet found at Mehrgarh, Pakistan.[11]  Copper as early as Period IIB 5100BCE–**4800BCE**  

While there is a strong continuity between the neolithic and chalcolithic (Copper Age) cultures of Mehrgarh, dental evidence shows that **the [chalcolithic](chalcolithic.html) population did not descend from the neolithic** population of Mehrgarh. "...lending credence to the suggested linguistic connection between the Elamite and Dravidic populations." Indians who are lactose-tolerant show a genetic pattern regarding this tolerance which is characteristic of the common European mutation, likely traveling **along the coast of the Persian Gulf** where other pockets of the same mutation have been found. The earliest evidence of **cattle herding** in south Asia comes from the Indus River Valley site of Mehrgarh and is dated to 7,000 YBP.

The one HARAPPA individual for which [we have DNA](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/indus-valley-civilization-dna-has-long-eluded-researchers/597481/) shows no steppe anchestry, but a mixture of old Iranian and Indian Hunter Gatherer.  

The oldest evidence for the drilling of human teeth in vivo was found in Mehrgarh 7,500 to 9,000 years ago. Advanced Medicine was part of the Neolithic package, and even has shamanic roots.  

The oldest ceramic figurines in South Asia were found at Mehrgarh. They occur in all phases of the settlement and were prevalent even before pottery appears, like in the Fertile Crescent and Europe.  

It became a central hub for merchandise and [cowry](cowry) shells just after shells faded in importance in Varna.
