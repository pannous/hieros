<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afanasievo_culture">Afanasievo</a> were an early <a href="PIE.html">PIE</a> 3300BC <a href="eneolithic.html">eneolithic</a>  bridge culture to <a href="china.html">china</a>. They where near 100% haplogroup R1b, distinguishable form the later R1a upsurge in Andronovo. <a href="Sintashta.html">Sintashta</a> formed a second  (2400-1800 BCE) bigger Bronze age wave, so that the copper age is almost absent from Chinese archeology. Possible earlier neolithic waves via land or sea are still clouded in mist.</p>

<p>Afanasevans were descended from people who migrated c. 3700–3300 BCE across the Eurasian Steppe from the pre-<a href="Yamnaya.html">Yamnaya</a> <a href="Repin.html">Repin</a> culture of the Don-Volga region.</p>

<p>Afanasevo is confirmed to be dominated by R1b-M269.<br />
Sintashta shows a mixed R1b-L23/ R1a-Z645 society</p>

<p>Afanasievo were "genetically indistinguishable" from the <a href="Yamnaya.html">Yamnaya</a> culture. the expansion of the ancestors of the Afanasievo people into the Altai was carried out through "large-scale migrations and population displacements",[1] without admixture with local populations. the study underpinned the theory that the Afansievo people were Indo-Europeans, perhaps ancestors of the Tocharians.</p>

<p>Both sampled Chemurchek individuals are of haplogroup R1b1a1a2a2-Z2103, in line with their almost direct genetic continuity with Afanasievo and with the two other reported samples to date (one C, one R1b).</p>

<p>Afanasievo shows local admixture</p>

<p>A striking finding in light of previous archaeological and genetic data is that the male child from Kurgak govi (individual I13957, skeletal code AT_629) has no evidence of Yamnaya-related ancestry despite his association with Afanasievo material culture (for example, he was buried in a barrow in the form of circular platform edged by vertical stone slabs, in stretched position on the back on the bottom of deep rectangular pit and with a typical Afanasievo egg-shaped vessel; his late Afanasievo chronology is confirmed by a direct radiocarbon date of 2858-2505 BCE). This is the first known case of an individual buried with Afanasievo cultural traditions who is not overwhelmingly Yamnaya-related</p>

<p>While the Afanasievo-derived lineages are consistent with having largely disappeared in Mongolia by the Late Bronze Age when our data showed that later groups with Steppe pastoralist ancestry made an impact, we confirm and strengthen previous ancient DNA analysis suggesting that the legacy of this expansion persisted in western China into the Iron Age <strong>Shirenzigou</strong> culture (410-190 BCE): Afanasievo ancestry without the characteristic European farmer-related mixture, which appeared later in Central Asia and Mongolia, persisted in Xinjiang.</p>

<p>While there are mongolian cultures connecting Europe and China, genetically and geographically it is a long long distance between these two divergent lineages:<br />

<p>If anything we can hope that in the future genetic samples of pre-ice age individuals show that the apparent bridge was a was absent in pre-neolithic times, proving that indeed the Afanasievo generated this cline between<br />
Europe and China; and through extension: contributed to the formation of the chinese civilization not just culturally but also genetically.</p>

<p>By 200BC, the Tarim Basin / XinJiang 新疆 populations where still mostly R1b/Q1a, indicating that they were remnants of the first wave, instead of the <a href="Oxus.html">Oxus</a> civilization “BMAC” which peaked 2400-1900 BC but had a different genetic setup:<br />
E1b1a 1/18, E1b1b 1/18, G 2/18, J* 2/18, J1 1/18, J2 4/18, L 2/18, R* 1/18, R1b 1/18, R2 2/18, and T 1/18.</p>

<p>Tarim Mummies surprisingly <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/western-china-s-mysterious-mummies-were-local-descendants-ice-age-ancestors">found</a> to be Holocene ANE relics with (near) zero influx of <a href="Oxus">BMAC</a> or <a href="Afanasievo.html">Afanasievo</a> ancestry!</p>

<p>On the other hand Afanasievo contributed 70-90% to neighboring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junggar_Basin">Dzungaria</a> EBA1 populations.</p>

<p>Since the Afanasievo cultural is found lake Baikal, its easy to postulate another PIE culture in Kyrgyzstan.</p>
