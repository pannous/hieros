Sebastian is not a figure mentioned in the Bible. The name is more commonly associated with Saint Sebastian, a Christian martyr who lived during the Roman Empire. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions, but his life and martyrdom are not found in biblical texts. Saint Sebastian’s legend grew in later Christian hagiography, especially related to his depiction as being shot with arrows.
