Human Origins

Raw material and [anthology](https://pannous.github.io/hieros/Home) for Egyptian and ‚Äúinternational‚Äù hieroglyphics.
  
To see the hieroglyphs you may need to install a [font](https://github.com/pannous/hieros/raw/master/fonts/NewGardinerSMP.ttf), unless you can alredy see this hieroglyph 'ìÖ≠' as a duck.

Then you can head over to the [ARTICLE](https://pannous.github.io/hieros/Home), [wiki](https://github.com/pannous/hieros/wiki) or [reddit](http://reddit.com/r/EgyptianHieroglyphs/).  

You can search the Egytian dictionary using the [hieroglyph keyboard](https://hieroglyph-keyboard.herokuapp.com/).
