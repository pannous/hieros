p. 200

*the beloved of Ptaḥ*, the god who maketh himself manifest.

3. the son of *PTOLEMY* and *ARSINOË*, the Father-loving gods; when

Saviour-Gods, and of the Brother-loving Gods, and of the Beneficent Gods,

Brother-loving Goddess;

temples, and the servants of the god, and those who are over the secret
things of the god, and the libationers [who] go into the most holy place
to array the gods in then apparel,

7. and the scribes of the holy writings, and the sages of the Double
House of Life, and the other libationers [who] had come from the
sanctuaries of the South and the North to MEMPHIS, on the day of the
festival, whereon

S. His Majesty, the King of the South and North *PTOLEMY, the
ever-living, the beloved of Ptaḥ*, the god who maketh himself manifest,
the lord of beauties, received the sovereignty from his father,

p. 201

entered into the SEḤETCH-CHAMBER, wherein they were wont to assemble, in
MAKHA-TAUI 1 <#fn_77>, and behold they declared thus:—

9. “Inasmuch as the King who is beloved by the gods, the King of the
South and North *Neterui-merui-ȧtui-ȧua-en-Ptaḥ-setep-en-usr-ka**Rā
ānkh-sekhem-Ȧmen,* the Son of the Sun *Ptolemy, the ever-living, beloved
of Ptaḥ*, the Gods who have made themselves manifest, the lord of
beauties, hath given things of all kinds in very large quantities unto
the lands of Horus and unto all

10. “those who dwell in them, and unto each and every one who holdeth
any dignity whatsoever in them, now behold, he is like unto a God, being
the son of a God [and] he was given by a Goddess, for he is the
counterpart of Horus, the son of Isis [and] the son of Osiris, the
avenger of his father Osiris—and behold, His Majesty.

11. “possessed a divine heart which was beneficent towards the gods; and
he hath given gold in large quantities, and grain in large quantities to
the temples and he hath given very many lavish gifts in order to make
Ta-Mert [Egypt] prosperous, and to make stable [her] advancement;

12. “and he hath given unto the soldiers who are in his august service .
. . . . . according to their rank

p. 202

[paragraph continues] [and of the taxes] some of them he hath cut off,
and some of them [he hath lightened], thus causing the soldiers and
those who live in the country to be prosperous

13. “under his reign [and as regards the sums which were due to the
royal house] from the people of Egypt, and likewise those [which were
due] from every one who was in his august service, His Majesty remitted
them altogether, howsoever great they were;

14. “and he hath forgiven the prisoners who were in prison, and ordered
that every one among them should be released from [the punishment] which
he had to undergo. And His Majesty made an order saying:—In respect of
the things [which are to be given to] the gods, and the money and the

15. “grain which are to be given to the temples each year, and all the
things [which are to be given to] the gods from the vineyards and from
the corn-lands of the nome, all the things which were then due under the
Majesty of his holy father

16. “shall he allowed to remain [in their amounts] to them as they were
then; and he hath ordered:—Behold, the treasury (?) shall not he made
more full of contributions by the hands of the priests than it was up to
the first year of the reign of His Majesty, his holy father; and His
Majesty hath remitted

17. “To the priests who minister in the temples in courses the journey
which they had been accustomed to make by river in boats to the city of
ALEXANDRIA at the beginning of each years and His Majesty
commanded:—Behold, those who are boatmen [by trade] shall not be seized [and

p. 203

made to serve in the Navy]; and in respect of the cloths of byssus
[which are] made in the temples for the royal house,

18. “he hath commanded that two-thirds of them shall be returned [to the
priests]; similarly, His Majesty hath [re]-established all the things,
the performance of which had been set aside, and hath restored them to
their former condition, and he hath taken the greatest care to cause
everything which ought to be done in the service of the gods to be done
in the sane way in which it was done

19. “in former [days]; similarly, he hath donc [all things] in a right
and proper manner; and he hath taken care to administer justice 1
<#fn_78> /to the people, even like Thoth, the great, great [God]; and he
hath, more over, ordered in respect of those of the troops who come
back, and the other people also, who during the/ 

20. “/strife of the revolution which took place had been ill disposed
[towards the Government], that when they return to their homes and lands
they shall have the power to remain in possession of their property, and
he hath taken great care to send/ infantry, and cavalry, and ships to
repulse those who were coming against

21. “Egypt by land as well as by sea; and he hath in consequence
expended a very large amount of money and of grain on them in order to
make prosperous the lands of Horus and Egypt.

22. “And His Majesty marched against the /town of Shekam/, which is in
front of (?) the town of UISET, /which was in the possession of the
enemy, and was provided with catapults, and was made ready for war with
weapons of every kind by/ 

p. 204

23. “the rebels who were in it—now they had committed great acts of
sacrilege in the land of Horus, and had done injury to those who dwelt
in Egypt—His Majesty attacked them by making a road [to their town],

24. “and he raised mounds (or walls) against them, and he dug trenches,
and whatsoever would lead [him] against them that he made; /and he
caused the canals which supplied the town with water to be blocked up, a
thing which none of the kings who preceded him had ever been able to do
before, and he expended a large amount of money on carrying out the work;/ 

25. “and His Majesty stationed infantry at the mouths of the canals /in
order to watch and to guard them against the extraordinary rise of the
waters/ [/of the Nile/], /which took place in the eighth year/ [/of his
reign/], /in the aforesaid canals which watered the fields, and were
unusually deep/ 

26. “in this spot; and His Majesty captured the town by assault in a
very short time, and he cut to pieces the rebels who were therein, and
he made an exceedingly great slaughter among them, even like unto that
which THOTH 1 <#fn_79> and HORUS, the son of Isis and [the son of
Osiris], made among those who rebelled against them 

27. “when they rebelled in this very place; and behold, those who had
led on the soldiers and were at their head, and who had disturbed the
borders [in the time of his father, and who had committed sacrilege in
the temples, when His Majesty came to MEMPHIS to avenge his father

p. 205

28. “and his own sovereignty he punished, according to their deserts,
when he came there to celebrate] the festival of the receiving of the
sovereignty from his father; and [besides this], he hath set aside [his
claim to

29. “the things which were due to His Majesty, and which were [then] in
the temples, up to the eighth year [of his reign, which amounted to no
small sum of] money and grain; and His Majesty hath also set aside [his
claim] to the cloths of byssus which ought to have been given to the
royal house and were [then] in the temples,

30. “and also the tax which they (/i.e./ the priests) ought to have
contributed for dividing the cloths into pieces, which was due up to
this day; and he hath also remitted to the temples the grain which was
usually levied as a tax on the corn-lands of the gods, and likewise the
measure of wine which was clue as a tax on vineyards [of the gods];

31. “and he hath done great things for APIS, and MNEVIS, and for every
shrine which contained a sacred animal, and he expended upon them more
than did his ancestors; and his heart hath entered into [the
consideration of everything] which was right and proper for them

32. “at every moment; and he hath given everything which was necessary
for the embalming of their bodies, lavishly, and in magnificent
abundance; and he hath undertaken the cost of their maintenance in their
temples, and the cost of their great festivals, and of their burnt
offerings, and sacrifices, and libations;

33. “[and he hath respected the privileges of the temples, and of Egypt,
and hath maintained them in a suitable

p. 206

manner according to what is customary and right; and he hath spent] both
money and grain to no small amount;

34. “and [hath provided] everything in great abundance for the house
wherein dwelleth the LIVING APIS; and His Majesty hath decorated it with
perfect and new ornamentations of the most beautiful character always;
and he hath made the LIVING APIS to rise [like the sun], and hath
founded temples, and shrines, and chapels [in his honour]; [and he hath
repaired the shrines, which needed repairs, and in all matters
appertaining to the service of the gods

35. “he hath manifested the spirit of a beneficent god; and during his
reign, having made careful inquiry, he hath restored the temples which
were held in the greatest honour, as was right] and in return for these
things the gods and goddesses have given him victory, and power, and
life, and strength, and health, and every beautiful thing of every kind
whatsoever, and

36. “in respect of his exalted rank, it shall be established to him and
to his children for ever and ever, with happy results (or life).”

And it has entered into the heart(s) of the priests of the temples of
the South and of the North, and of each and every temple [that all the
honours which

37. are paid] to the King of the South and North *Ptolemy, the
ever-living, the beloved of Ptaḥ*, the [God who maketh himself manifest,
whose deeds are beautiful, and those which are paid to the Father-loving
Gods who begot him, and to the Beneficent Gods who begot those who begot
him, and to the Brother-Gods who begot the begetters of his begetters,]

p. 207

38. and to the Saviour-Gods, shall be [greatly increased]; and a statue
of the King of the South and North, *Ptolemy, ever-living, beloved of
Ptaḥ*, the God who maketh himself manifest, the Lord of beauties, shall
be set up [in every temple, in the most prominent place], and it shall be

39, called by his name "*PTOLEMY*, the SAVIOUR of EGYPT," the
interpretation (?) of which is "*PTOLEMY*, THE VICTORIOUS ONE." [And it
shall stand side by side with a statue of the Lord of the gods (?), who
giveth him the weapon of victory, and it shall be fashioned after the
manner of the Egyptians, and a statue of this kind shall be set up in]

40. all the temples which are called by his name. And adoration shall he
paid unto these statues three times each day, and every rite and
ceremony which it is proper to perform before them shall be performed,
and whatsoever is prescribed, and is fitting for their DOUBLES, shall be
performed, even as it is performed for the gods of the Nomes during the
festivals and on every sacred day (?), on the day of [his] coronation,
and on his name-day. And there shall likewise [be set up] a

41. magnificent (?) statue of the King of the South and North *Ptolemy,
ever-living beloved of Ptaḥ*, the God who maketh himself manifest, whose
deeds are beautiful, the son of *Ptolemy*, and *Arsinoë*, the
Father-loving gods, and with the statue there shall be a magnificent
shrine [made] of the finest copper and inlaid with real stones of every
kind,

p. 208

42. in every temple which is called by his name; and this statue shall
rest in the most holy place [in the temples] side by side with the
shrines of the gods of the Nomes. And on the days of the great
festivals, when the god [of the temple] cometh forth from his holy
habitation, according to his day, the holy shrine of the God who maketh
himself manifest, the lord of beauties, shall likewise be made to rise
[like the Sun]

43. with them. And in order to make this new shrine to be easily
distinguishable [both at the present day, and in future times, they
shall set] upon this shrine [ten royal double crowns, made of gold and
upon [each of the double crowns there shall be placed the [serpent which
it is right and proper to make for the [double crown of gold], instead
of the two Uraei

44. which are [placed] upon the tops of the shrines, and the SEKHENT
CROWN shall be in the middle of them, because it was in the SEKHENT
CROWN in which His Majesty shone in the house of the KA of PTAḤ (/i.e./,
Memphis)

45. at the time when the king entered into the temple, and performed the
ceremonies which it was meet and right for him to perform on receiving
the exalted rank [of King]. And on the upper surface of the square
pedestal which is round these crowns, and in the middle part thereof
[which is immediately] beneath] the double Crown [/they shall engrave a
papyrus plant and a plant of the south; and they shall set them in such
a way that a vulture/, /upon neb/, , /beneath which a plant of the south
shall be found, shall be affixed to the right-hand upper corner of the
golden shrine, and a serpent/, , /under/ 

p. 209

/which is/ , /placed upon/] a papyrus plant, [shall be affixed] to the
left hand side [at the upper corner]; and

46. the interpretation [of these signs is]:—"Lord of the shrine of
NEKHEBET, and Lord of the shrine of UATCHET, who illumineth the land of
the White Crown, and the land of the Red Crown." And inasmuch as the
last day of the fourth month of the season SHEMU 1 <#fn_80> (/i.e./,
MESORE), which is the birthday of the beautiful ever-living god, is
already established as a feast day, and it hath been observed as a day
of festival in the lands of HORUS (/i.e./, the temple lands) from the
olden time; and moreover, the seventeenth day of the second month of the
season SHAT 2 <#fn_81> (i.e., PAOPI),

47. whereon [His Majesty] performed the ceremonies of royal accession,
when he received the sovereignty from his father, [is also observed as a
day of festival], and behold [these days] have been the source of all
[good] things wherein all men have participated; these days, that is to
say, the seventeenth and the last day of each month, shall be kept as
festivals in the temples

48. of Egypt, in each and every one of them; and on these days burnt
offerings shall be offered up, and meat offerings, and everything which
it is right and customary to perform at the celebration of festivals
shall be performed on these days every month, and on these festivals
every man shall do (/i.e./, offer up) what he is accustomed to do on
[other] fes-

49. tivals in the temples. [And the priests also decreed] /that the
things which/ [/are brought to the temples/] as

p. 210

/offerings shall be given unto the persons who/ [/minister in the
temples; and festivals and processions shall be established in the
temples, and in all Egypt, in honour of/] the King of the South and
North, *Ptolemy, ever-living, beloved of Ptaḥ,* the god who maketh
himself manifest, whose deeds are beautiful, each year,

50. beginning with the first day of the first month of the season Shat
(/i.e/., Thoth) up to the fifth day thereof [and on these days the
people shall wear] garlands on their heads, and they shall make festal
the altars, and shall offer up meat and drink offerings, and shall
perform everything which it is right and proper to perform. And the
priests of all the temples which are called after his name

51. shall have, in addition to all the other priestly titles which they
may possess, the title of "Servant of the god who maketh himself
manifest, whose deeds are beautiful"; [/and this title shall be endorsed
on all deeds and documents which are laid up in the temples/]; and they
shall cause to be engraved on the rings which they wear on their hands,
the title of "Libationer of the god who maketh himself manifest, whose
deeds are beautiful."

52. And behold, it shall he in the hands of those who live in the
country, and those who desire [it], to establish a copy of the shrine of
the god who maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are beautiful, and set
it up in their houses, and they shall be at liberty to keep festivals
and make rejoicings [before it] each month

53. and each year; and in order to make those who are in Egypt to know
[/why it is that the Egyptians pay honour—as it is most right and proper
to do—to the/ 

p. 211

/god who maketh himself beautiful, whose deeds are beautiful, the
priests have decreed/] that this DECREE shall [/be inscribed/] upon a
stele of hard stone in the writing of the words of the gods, and the
writing of the books, and in the writing of HAUI-NEBUI (i.e., Greeks),
and it shall be set up in the sanctuaries in the temples which [are
called] by his name, of the first, second, and third [class], near the
statue of the HORUS, the King of the South and North *Ptolemy,
ever-living, beloved of Ptaḥ*, the god who maketh himself manifest,
whose deeds are beautiful.
