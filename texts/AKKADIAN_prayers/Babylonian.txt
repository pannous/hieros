Acknowledgments 

Several people deserve a word of thanks for their role in the production of 
this book. I first and foremost want to thank all of the contributors for signing 
on to this project and working hard to bring it to completion. Among the con-
tributors,  I  especially  wish  to  thank  Christopher  Frechette,  Duane  Smith,  and 
Anna Zernecke. Christopher was a constant source of information, conversation, 
and  encouragement.  This  book  has  greatly  benefited  from his  sage  advice  and 
scholarly knowledge. Duane lent his programming expertise to the project, mak-
ing the transformation of Unicode to  cuneiform as painless as  one  could hope. 
He saved me many, many hours of tedious work. Anna  graciously took on the 
review of biblical scholarship for the general introduction rather late in the pro-
ject, allowing me extra time to focus on editorial tasks. That section is no doubt 
the better for her having written it. I also wish to extend my heartfelt apprecia-
tion to several people, including some of the above, who read drafts of my con-
tributions  to  this  volume  and  offered  their  suggestions  and  critical  feedback: 
Tzvi Abusch, Jeffrey Cooley, Christopher Frechette, Eugene McGarry, Seth Sand-
ers, Duane Smith, and Niek Veldhuis. When I did not follow their suggestions, I 
did  so  only  after  much  deliberation,  in  full  knowledge  that  I  alone  must  take 
responsibility for my work. Monica Schutzman and the Interlibrary Loan staff at 
University of the Pacific were a tremendous support throughout the duration of 
this project. Getting obscure Assyriological works into the Central Valley is their 
speciality. Leigh Andersen from the Society of Biblical Literature editorial staff 
was a patient guide as I laid out the complicated pages of this volume. And final-
ly, I wish to thank my family for allowing me to work ridiculous hours every day 
of the week during the final months of this project. They are always a source of 
comfort, joy, and diversion.

About This Book 

ALAN LENZI 

This book is a pedagogical tool intended to increase reading fluency for sec-
ond  or  third  semester  Akkadian  students  by  way  of  annotated  readings.  It  is 
equally an introduction to Akkadian prayers  and  hymns from ancient Mesopo-
tamia:  selected  classes,  their  vocabulary  and  phraseology,  and  to  some  extent 
their ritual uses. Finally, the introductory material in this book exposes readers 
to theoretical and critical perspectives that will be useful in the study of other 
ancient religious texts. More advanced students of Akkadian may therefore find 
something profitable here as well. 

The idea for this book was inspired by tools developed in Biblical and Clas-
sical Studies in which lexical and grammatical help is printed on the same page 
as the ancient text to  be  read.1  This arrangement cuts  out the time-consuming 
process of looking up words and allows the intermediate student to cement their 
basic  grammatical  knowledge  and  expand  their  vocabulary  through  extensive 
reading. There is currently nothing like this available for Akkadian.  

As many students will attest, academic books are often quite expensive, tak-
ing important tools out of the reach of economically-challenged students and/or 
those who may be without access to a well-stocked academic research library. It 
is gratifying therefore to make this volume available free of charge through the 
SBL’s electronic open-access Ancient Near East Monograph series. If the reader 
finds this tool useful, please feel free to share it with others. 

Because  prayers  and  hymns—but  especially  prayers—display  stereotyped 
forms  and  utilize  a  manageable  core  of  vocabulary,  selecting  texts  from  this 
body  of  material  seemed  a  perfect  choice  for  this  kind  of  book.  But  selecting 
prayers  and  hymns  also  serves  educational  interests  beyond  Akkadian  fluency 
for the book’s targeted audiences. For Assyriological students, learning the forms 
and vocabulary of prayers and hymns as well as something about the addressees

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

of such is an important step toward gaining a broad familiarity with the Akkadi-
an religious textual corpus. The contents and format of this book will facilitate 
acquiring that familiarity with relative ease, preparing them for advanced study. 
Although Classicists are increasingly taking an interest in Akkadian, the majority 
of non-Assyriological students who study Akkadian comes from the ranks of bib-
lical  scholarship.  As  there  is  a  long  history  of  interaction  between  Assyriology 
and Biblical Studies in the matter of prayers and hymns, selecting texts from this 
corpus again seemed to serve an important segment of Akkadian students. It is 
hoped that this volume will fill a gap in the available resources to these Akkadi-
an students and spur other scholars on to produce similar pedagogical materials 
for different genres, especially historical inscriptions. 

THE SELECTION OF TEXTS IN THIS VOLUME: 

There  are  a  great many  texts  one might  choose  to  include  in  a  volume of 
Akkadian prayers and hymns. We have made our very limited selection accord-
ing to a few guiding principles.  

 

1.  Texts included in this volume represent several different kinds of Akkadian pray-
ers.  Not  every  category  of  prayer  is  represented,  but  a  good  variety  is  of-
fered. Due to the great number of extant shuilla- and incantation-prayers as 
well as their importance in both Assyriological research and the compara-
tive work  of biblical  scholars, we  have  included a very generous selection 
from these categories. As hymns are not nearly as numerous and those pre-
served are often quite long (e.g., two hundred lines), only a couple of sam-
ples have been included. But as one will see, most prayers contain a hymnic 
element. So even when reading a prayer, one frequently will gain some ex-
posure to the language of praise as well. 

2.  Texts included in this volume reflect a wide variety of addressees. We have in-
cluded prayers to most of the high gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon (En-
lil, Ashur, and Ninurta are obvious omissions) as well as examples of pray-
ers to personal gods, familial  ghosts, and  materials  used in the  cult. Some 
deities are very richly represented among extant prayers (e.g., Shamash, Ish-
tar,  and  Marduk).  We  have  reflected  this  popularity  by  including  several 
prayers addressed to these gods. 

3.  Texts  included  in  this  volume  have  a  suitable  modern  edition  available.  The 
treatments offered in this volume do not produce a new critical edition of 
the prayer or hymn under study. That epigraphic and text critical work has 
been done, freeing contributors to focus on helping students understand the 
grammar  and meaning  of the  texts.  Satisfying the  first  two  criteria  above, 
however, took precedence over this criterion. There are a few cases there-
fore in which contributors were forced to use a dated edition (e.g., from Er-
ich  Ebeling’s  Die  akkadische  Gebetsserie  “Handerhebung.”  Von  neuem  gesam-

melt  und  herausgegeben  (Berlin:  Akademie-Verlag,  1953;  abbreviated,  Ebe-
ling, AGH).2 

4.  Texts included in this volume have accessible modern translations available. Alt-
hough each treatment includes a fresh translation, choosing to treat previ-
ously  translated  texts  ensured  that  each  text  would  be  relatively  well-
understood.  This  gave  contributors  conversation  partners  in  their  annota-
tions and offers students more resources for in-depth study. 

5.  Texts included in this volume are written in either the Old Babylonian (OB) or 
Standard  Babylonian  (SB)  dialects  of  the  Akkadian  language.  Prayers  and 
hymns are preserved in various Akkadian dialects. But most students begin 
learning Akkadian with the OB dialect and then progress to SB. It  seemed 
pedagogically appropriate therefore to include prayers in these two dialects 
(as  opposed  to  also  including  some  in  Assyrian  or peripheral  dialects).  As 
the  greatest  number  of  prayers  and  hymns  are  preserved  in  SB  and  most 
second year Akkadian students will be ready to read these, the SB prayers 
comprise the majority of texts treated in this volume. 

THE CONTENTS OF EACH TEXTUAL TREATMENT: 

Each textual treatment in this volume is self-contained. A student can begin 
reading with text no. 13 (ӎ⼯⼯⼯), for example, and have all the information neces-
sary within the treatment to read and understand that text.3 This feature allows 
students to read the prayers in any order; it also gives professors the flexibility 
to assign any sub-set of prayers in the volume without concern that the student 
will be missing something assumed from an earlier textual treatment. Although 
this manner of presentation results in significant overlap and repetition, this is 
pedagogically beneficial. Seeing the meanings of the same word over and over 
will help a student lock it into their memory. As the  student’s reading  fluency 
increases, they can easily pass  over glosses and annotations  that are  no longer 
necessary to them. Each treatment includes the following sections: 

An introduction to the deity/entity addressed or praised 
An introduction to the prayer 
The text of the prayer or hymn in transliteration 
Notes on the text, including a normalization 
Comparative suggestions 
A translation in English 
The text of the prayer in a cuneiform font 

 
2  One of the most pressing desiderata in Assyriological research related to prayers is a compre-
hensive edition of all of the known Akkadian shuillas. 
3  Cross-referencing between treatments is limited, generally reserved for major issues or refer-
ence to deities.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Deity. Each treatment begins with a succinct introduction to the entity ad-
dressed  or  praised  in  the  text.  In  most  cases,  this  means  an  introduction  to  a 
deity. But in a few treatments, the addressee is undetermined (see the Prayer to 
Any God on page 447) or  not a deity (as in the prayers to familial ghosts, see 
page  133,  and  salt,  page  189).  These  introductions  attempt  to  give  something 
more than what one finds in Jeremy Black’s and Anthony Green’s useful book, 
Gods,  Demons  and  Symbols  of Ancient  Mesopotamia,4  but  less  than  the  very  rich 
and technical entries in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie (RlA). Although the con-
tent of the introductions varies, the ones concerned with deities usually include 
a discussion of the deity’s sphere of power, their position in the pantheon, their 
original  city,  the  locations  of  their  major  temples,  their  relationships  to  other 
deities,  their  iconographic  and  astrological  representations,  and  their  divine 
number. The purpose of this section is to help the reader gain some familiarity 
with the deity so as to understand the broader context of the prayer. The reader 
who works through this book will have substantially enriched their knowledge 
of a variety of non-obvious beings from ancient Mesopotamia. 

The Prayer. The second section of each treatment gives an introduction to 
the prayer or hymn under consideration. In the case of many SB prayers, these 
texts are identified by the name of the deity invoked followed by a number (e.g., 
Shamash 1 or Nusku 12). This identification convention follows Werner Mayer’s 
catalog of incantation-prayers in his important work Untersuchungen zur Formen-
sprache  der  babylonischen  „Gebetsbeschwörungen“  (abbreviated,  Mayer,  UFBG).5 
Although one might expect these introductions to vary due to each text’s indi-
vidual character, genre, or availability of data, they also vary due to the differ-
ent interests of the contributing authors. Some contributors give more attention 
to the ritual uses  of the particular text under discussion while others prefer to 
exposit  the  text’s  literary  features  and  themes.  This  diversity  of  approach  will 
benefit the reader by illustrating the diverse results various analytical and inter-
pretive methods can produce. The one common denominator in all of the treat-
ments is the identification of the structure of the prayer, that is, how it “works” 
rhetorically. 

Essential  Bibliography.  After  the  two  introductions,  each  treatment  in-
cludes an essential bibliography for both the deity and the text treated. The full 
citation for works cited by author or by author and short title in the footnotes to 
the introductions will be found here. In the case of prayers and hymns, the bib-
liography  includes  references  to  the  most  recent  edition,  several  translations, 
and  an  important  work  or  two  that  has  discussed  the  text  at  some  length—if 
available. As the title of the section indicates, this is only essential bibliography 
as judged by the contributors and the editor. It is not exhaustive.

ABOUT THIS BOOK 

xiii

Edition: Knowing the edition upon which the treatment’s text is based was 
considered essential. Full publication information for each witness to or manu-
script  (MS)  of  the  text  was  not  deemed  essential.  Usually,  one  can  consult  the 
text’s most recent edition to learn the identity of the various manuscripts (MSS, 
that is, tablets) that attest the text. And this will tell the reader where the tablets 
are housed and assist them in locating the pertinent hand copies or photos for 
further  study.  Generally,  only  in  cases  where  the  edition  is  very  dated  (e.g., 
when  the  only  edition  is  in  Ebeling’s  AGH)  or  is  in  press  (e.g.,  the  shuilla  to 
Nisaba) has information about the tablets and/or their copies been included in 
the  bibliography  or  its  footnotes.  Consulting  tablets  (deciphering  or  collating 
actual tablets and reading from photos or hand copies of tablets) is a very im-
portant part of Assyriological research and therefore an essential element of As-
syriological  training.  The  present  volume,  however,  is  not  intended  to  be  a 
handbook  on  cuneiform  epigraphy  or  a  manual  on  how  to  produce  a  critical 
edition. It is a tool to facilitate more fluent reading in Akkadian religious texts. 
For  readers  who  want  to  learn  more  about  the  textual  basis  for  an  individual 
prayer, the best place to start is the most recently published critical edition. 

Translations:  References  to  the  translations  by  Foster  (English),  Seux 
(French),  and  Falkenstein/von  Soden  (German),  when  available,  are  included 
among the essential bibliography, although contributors may choose to add oth-
ers. Reference to these translators is made by way of their last name alone. Fos-
ter’s translations may be found in Benjamin R. Foster, Before the Muses: An An-
thology of Akkadian Literature (3d ed.; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2005); Seux’s are in 
Marie-Joseph Seux, Hymnes et Prieres aux Dieux de Babylonie et d’Assyrie (Paris: 
Les  Éditions  de  Cerf,  1976);  and  von  Soden’s  (in  one  of  our  prayers,  Falken-
stein’s) are in Adam Falkenstein and Wolfram von Soden, Sumerische und akka-
dische  Hymnen  und  Gebete  (Die  Bibliothek  der  Alten  Welt;  Stuttgart:  Artemis-
Verlag  Zürich,  1953),  233–407.  For  students  interested  in  digging  deeper  into 
the text of a prayer or hymn, these translations, especially Foster and Seux, are a 
treasure  trove  of  useful  information,  often  offering  different  understandings  of 
the text, pointing to further bibliography, and sometimes including new witness-
es discovered since the production of the text’s critical edition. 

The  Text  in  Transliteration.  Anyone  wishing  to  utilize  Akkadian  in  their 
research will encounter the language in transliteration, that is, in a sign for sign 
system of notation using Latin letters and various diacritical marks. The center 
piece of each treatment therefore is the text of the prayer or the hymn in trans-
literation. The text is printed a few lines at a time at the top of the page. 

The text  utilized in  each treatment generally follows the reconstruction of 
the most recent critical edition with one major exception: in order to avoid over-
loading the student’s eye with epigraphic technicalities, half-brackets in the edi-
tions were ignored. Moreover, no textual apparatus is included and there has been 
no attempt to provide in the notes a comprehensive discussion of all of the vari-
ants in all of the MSS of each prayer or hymn. Such would have transformed this 
work into something quite different. Occasionally, a departure from the critical 
edition’s reconstructed text is identified in a note at the foot of the page. Depar-

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

tures may be something as simple as selecting a variant reading rather than the 
one preferred by the critical edition because the variant provided a pedagogical-
ly  advantageous  text.  For  example,  the  edition  may  have  selected  the  harder 
reading (lectio difficilior) when deciding between variants whereas the contribu-
tor to this volume preferred the one best suited to a pedagogical context. In oth-
er cases, the critical edition required the contributors to make a decision about 
which lines to include and which lines to exclude. For example, various MSS of a 
prayer may preserve a self-introduction formula at different places in the prayer 
or one MS may insert an attalû-formula while others lack it. If the critical edition 
did not reconstruct an “original” text (as, e.g., in the editions for Sin 1 and the 
Universal Namburbi), the contributors had to make decisions about what would 
be used in their treatment and what would be excluded. It must be emphasized 
therefore that the texts used in this edition are no substitute for the consultation and 
careful study of a modern critical edition and the individual witnesses that preserve 
the  text.  For  readers  who  want  to  understand  the  textual  diversity  of  a  given 
prayer or take their study of its text to an advanced level, they absolutely must 
consult the text’s modern critical edition. 

A word should also be said here about the use of sequential line numbering 
in the presentation of the texts. Critical editions may  reconstruct line  numbers 
based  on  what  the  editor  has  chosen  as  the  primary  textual  witness  (usually 
dubbed  MS  A). This, for example, was the procedure used by  Werner Mayer in 
the selection of prayers he edited at the back of UFBG (439–541). In other cases, 
the editor contrives a system of line numbering that makes the best sense of the 
preserved,  perhaps  fragmentary  witnesses  and  allows  for  designating  what  the 
editor deems secondary. When variant lines occur, they are given number-letter 
designations (e.g., 7a and 7b would occur after line 7 of the main text) or simply 
placed in a footnote. The potential for confusion in this diversity of methods in 
text editions is compounded by the fact that some texts are part of a larger, mul-
ti-tablet work. For example, the prayers to salt and to Girra included in this vol-
ume come from the eight-tablet, anti-witchcraft series called Maqlû, “burning,” 
and the hymn to Marduk comes from the four-tablet poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi. The 
texts  of  these  prayers  are  properly  referenced  by  the  tablet  in  which  the  text 
occurs and then the line number on that tablet (e.g., I 1–40, which means Tablet 
I, lines 1 through 40).  

For  pedagogical  purposes,  a  simplified  consistent  numbering  method  was 
decided upon. Throughout the volume, each treatment begins with line number 
1 and proceeds sequentially to the text’s end, even when the critical edition or 
the position of the text in a multi-tablet series indicated otherwise. There is only 
one exception to this practice. In the Universal Namburbi, there is a gap (due to 
a tablet break) of undetermined length in the middle of the text (see page 412). 
When the text resumes, the line numbering in this treatment begins with 1ʹ. As 
is  standard  in  Assyriological  literature,  the  prime marker  (ʹ)  indicates  that  the 
absolute line numbering cannot be determined due to a lack of evidence among 
the witnesses (because of a break on a tablet).

Annotations. At the foot of the page are brief notes on each line of Akkadi-
an text. Every logogram in the text is given its Akkadian equivalent and the first 
occurrence of each word in the prayer or hymn is defined briefly.6 At the discre-
tion of the contributor, grammatical and syntactical help is provided for difficult 
forms  or  complex  sentences.  In  many  notes,  the  contributor  also  offers  brief 
commentary  that  may  highlight  a  literary  feature,  a  ritual  gesture,  and/or  a 
broader textual, linguistic, or cultural item suggested by the text. At the end of 
each note the text of the Akkadian line is given again in normalized Akkadian, 
that  is,  in  a  Latin-character  transcription  that  approximates  how  the  language 
would  have  sounded  in  ancient  times.  This  normalization  is  intended  to  help 
clarify the grammar of the line. 

Assyriologists have differing ideas about how to normalize an Akkadian sen-
tence. Even the dictionaries disagree sometimes about the normalization of indi-
vidual words (e.g., they often disagree about vowel length and doubled conso-
nants).  For  consistency’s  sake,  contributors  were  asked  to  follow  John 
Huehnergard’s system of normalization as practiced in his popular pedagogical 
grammar, A Grammar of Akkadian, 2d ed.,7 and the normalization of words ac-
cording to the handbook dictionary most students will use in their early studies: 
A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian (CDA,8 based on von Soden’s AHw9). But there 
is  an  important  caveat  with  regard  to  the  latter’s  use.  Unlike  the  CDA,  which 
always gives the lemma in OB form, the glossed words and normalized lines of 
text in this volume always use OB forms in OB texts and SB forms in SB texts 
(e.g., amātu instead of awātum in SB texts). An alternate normalization or the OB 
form  is  sometimes  given  alongside  an  Akkadian  word  that  is  glossed  in  the 
notes. The alternates are given in order to facilitate looking these words up in 
the  Chicago  Assyrian  Dictionary  (CAD)10—the  indispensible  reference  lexicon  of 
the  Akkadian  language—or  the  OB-based  CDA.  After  gaining  some  familiarity 
with the basic sound changes from OB to SB Akkadian (see Huehnergard’s Ap-
pendix  D)  and  some  practice,  navigating  through  these  minor  differences  and 
disagreements among the dictionaries will be no trouble. 

Another point about normalization requires our brief attention. SB Akkadian 
shows  more  freedom  in  the  use  of  case-endings  (final  vowels)  on  substantives 
 
6  Given  the  multiple  contributors  to  the  volume  and  the  varied  contexts  in  which  words  are 
used,  the  editor  has  not  attempted  a  thorough  standardization  of  the  meanings  of  words  that 
recur frequently.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

than  does  OB  Akkadian.  Late  copies  of  SB  compositions  (from,  e.g.,  Babylon, 
Sippar, and Uruk) show even more freedom—some might say disarray—in this 
respect. Normalizations in this volume have not forced these texts to conform to 
OB grammatical expectations. The case ending in the text at the top of the page 
is also adopted in the normalization in the notes. If the tablet reads a genitive 
where one expects an accusative, the normalization will show the genitive. The 
contributors  often  alert  the  student  to  these  instances  in  their  grammatical 
comments. 

Comparative Suggestions. Comparativism may have fallen out of style in 
many fields (due to Postmodernism’s particularism and the many pitfalls inher-
ent  in  comparative  practices)  but  it  continues  unabated  among  Akkadian-
reading biblical scholars.11 Given the series and publisher of the present volume, 
it seemed appropriate to include in each treatment a section in which the con-
tributor offers ideas about how the Akkadian prayer might tie in to biblical liter-
ature on a linguistic, thematic, or cultural (including religious) level. Assyriolog-
ical students may not be interested in this section. It is easily skipped. Biblical 
students may wish for more. That is often facilitated by references to the biblical 
text and/or secondary literature. It should be emphasized that contributors were 
instructed  to  offer  only  brief  suggestions  not  fully  developed  arguments,  which 
could easily—but were not allowed to—over-shadow the entire treatment.  

Translation. The translations offered for each text in this volume tend to-
ward  the  literal  side  of  the  translation  spectrum.  They  are  not  intended  to  be 
polished,  literary  renderings.  A  literal-tending  translation  gives  the  reader  one 
more layer of help to understand the Akkadian grammar. As the reader advances 
in  their  knowledge  of  Akkadian,  their  translations  should  progress  toward  a 
more  sophisticated  translation  technique.  In  fact,  we  encourage  readers  to  re-
work  the  translations  offered  here  in  light  of  their  own  interpretive  decisions 
and as their Akkadian fluency increases.12 
 
11  For an important essay that argues for the continued usefulness of the comparative method in 
Religious Studies, see Jonathan Z. Smith, “In Comparison a Magic Dwells,” in his Imagining Reli-
gion: From Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago Studies in the History of Judaism; Chicago and London: 
University of Chicago Press, 1982), 19–35. A more recent book that builds on Smith’s view (ac-
tually reprinting his essay in full on pp. 23–44) is Kimberley C. Patton and Benjamin C. Ray, A 
Magic Still Dwells: Comparative Religion in the Postmodern Age (Berkeley: University of California 
Press, 2000). 
12  A brief note about inclusive language: Throughout the prayers, the supplicant is referred to in 
Akkadian with masculine singular pronouns. Although in some cases, it is clear that the suppli-
cant is a man, there is no conclusive evidence known to me that the supplicant in all prayers was 
always male. Since the masculine grammatical gender was the default gender and since it seems 
unlikely to me that women never prayed or needed the services of an exorcist, it seems reasona-
ble to believe women prayed other prayers besides those dealing with specifically women’s is-
sues (e.g., Ishtar 28 and 29). Rather than cluttering up the text with “he or she” or “her/him,” 
etc.  when  referring  to  the  supplicant,  I  have  advised  contributors  to  use  the  pronouns  “they, 
them, their, theirs.” For justification of using a third person plural pronoun as a gender neutral 
third person singular pronoun, see the online dictionary maintained by Oxford University Press 
at this address: http://oxforddictionaries.com/page/384 (accessed last, March 12, 2011). On the

Cuneiform. At the end of each treatment the Akkadian text is presented in 
a Unicode cuneiform font. Unlike the sophisticated shading of signs in the most 
recent volumes of the State Archives of Assyria Cuneiform Text (SAACT) series, 
there  is no indication  of restored or broken signs. The available Unicode fonts 
did not allow this kind of precision. Moreover, in some cases, the signs are not 
quite perfectly shaped. The cuneiform is given here simply so readers can prac-
tice their knowledge of the script. This neat, uniform presentation of the text in 
cuneiform  is,  of  course,  no  substitute  for  reading  from  hand  copies,  photos  of 
tablets, and eventually the tablets themselves. The reality on the tablets is much 
messier and, on first glance at least, more chaotic than anything a handbook can 
teach.  

The font used for OB texts, Santakku, is based on the OB cursive sign list. 
The SB font is called Assurbanipal, based on the Neo-Assyrian inventory of signs. 
Both fonts were created by Sylvie Vanséveren at the Université Libre de Brux-
elles.13 Students wishing to work from the cuneiform are encouraged to print out 
a hardcopy of the pages containing this section and  use it in tandem  with the 
transliteration and notes. 

 
other  hand,  and  despite  the inconsistency,  we  have  not  rendered  māru,  “son,”  in  an  inclusive 
manner when it appears in the phrase annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so.” 
13  The  fonts  are  embedded  in  the  PDF  file  and  should  display  properly  without  installing  the 
font. If, however, one wishes to obtain the fonts for other uses, they may be downloaded at the

ALAN LENZI, CHRISTOPHER FRECHETTE, AND ANNA ELISE ZERNECKE* 

 
Interpreting  textual  remains  from  an  ancient  culture  requires  a  reader  to 
develop multiple competencies that will both situate the textual material in its 
original  context  and  translate  this  material  to  the  contemporary  sphere  in  a 
manner  that  is  authentic  yet  understandable.  The  interpreter  of  ancient  texts 
requires more than a strong knowledge of the language used in the texts; they 
also need a theoretical interpretive framework suitable to the material at hand, a 
broad  understanding  of  the  historical,  cultural,  and  textual  issues  surrounding 
the  documents,  and  a  literary  competence  in  the  specific  genres  to  which  the 
texts belong. Religious texts from ancient Mesopotamia present an array of chal-
lenges with regard to the acquisition of these intellectual tools, challenges which 
are  compounded  by  the  fact  that  the  texts  are  often  utilized  in  a  comparative 
fashion.  This  introductory  chapter  is  intended  to  help  the  reader  of  Akkadian 
prayers and hymns begin working through these complex issues and developing 
the multiple competencies required to interpret ancient prayers and hymns well. 
First, this introduction sets out a general interpretive framework for defin-
ing and understanding prayer and praise within the various human activities we 
deem religious. Although space will not permit a full discussion of all the com-
plexities  involved,  issues  surrounding  the  definition  of  religion,  the  academic 
study  of  religion  in  a  post-Enlightenment  Western  intellectual  milieu,  and  the 
multi-faceted  character  of  prayer  and  praise  will  receive  some  attention.  The 
goal  in  this  section,  although  apparently  distant  from  Akkadian  prayers  and 
hymns, is to familiarize the reader with some broad trends in Religious Studies 
so as to sharpen their interpretive approach to the Akkadian materials.  

Second, turning to ancient Mesopotamia, this introduction provides  a gen-
eral discussion of the definition of prayer and to some extent praise as they are 
applied to ancient Mesopotamian texts in order to fine tune these definitions to 
the Akkadian material. This inevitably brings up the thorny issue of how modern 

 
*  Although throughout the writing of  this introduction we  have enjoyed several collegial con-
versations and offered one another constructive criticism of the other’s material, each scholar is 
responsible for their section(s) alone: Frechette for the shuilla-prayer discussion, Zernecke for the 
comparative discussion, and Lenzi for the remaining parts.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

scholarly categorizations relate (or should relate) to the ancient scribal classifi-
catory labels that were applied to the texts. The position adopted here is that the 
modern imposition of conceptual categories and definitions upon ancient texts is 
inevitable  and  can  be  quite useful for  the modern  scholar;  however,  one must 
also  be  ever  vigilant  to  reflect  upon  the  relationship  between  the  modern  and 
ancient manner of  classifying  texts lest  one  conflate one’s own categories with 
those of the Mesopotamians and distort the material being interpreted.  

Third, having explored the parameters of  Akkadian prayer and praise  in a 
general manner, the focus narrows to descriptions of the most important kinds of 
Akkadian texts scholars have usually classified as prayers. The goal in this sec-
tion  is  to  provide  useful  overviews  along  with  essential  bibliographical  assis-
tance that will help the reader understand the specific prayers included in this 
volume (and others they may read outside of this volume) within the context of 
prayers of the same class.  

Finally, a brief survey of the use of Akkadian prayers in biblical scholarship 
concludes the introductory material. Akkadian prayers  and hymns have a long 
history of comparative use, full of pitfalls, missteps, but also insights. This sec-
tion informs the reader of the history of scholarship and offers suggestions for 
the way ahead. 

Due to the length and varied content of the introduction, one might find it 
most useful to read the first two sections before reading any Akkadian texts and 
then return to the relevant part of the third section when one begins to read a 
prayer from a particular class. The fourth section may be read independently. 

PRAYERS AND HYMNS IN A RELIGIOUS STUDIES PERSPECTIVE: 

The  various  characteristics  that  comprise  what  is  called  “prayer”  and 
“hymn” are commonly understood by contemporary people as falling within the 
conceptual domain of religion, a term readily understood when used in everyday 
conversation. Though a tacit definition of religion may be useful—indeed, neces-
sary—in  everyday  life,  it  repays  the  careful  student  of  another  culture  (and 
time!) to reflect upon issues surrounding the definition of religion, lest one im-
pose one’s own parochial understanding of religion on the culture under study in 
a  prejudicial  and/or  uncritical  manner.  Of  course,  defining  religion  is  rather 
complex and raises more issues than can be covered, let alone solved here. The 
following  reflections  therefore  remain  general  and  are  only  intended  to  intro-
duce  the  philological  student  to  some  issues  and  contemporary  literature  that 
may contribute to the development of a general interpretive framework for Mes-
opotamian religious texts, especially prayers and hymns.  

Like other abstract terms used in the social sciences—terms such as art, lit-
erature, or history—religion is not easily defined.1 Unlike objective entities such

as a book, a desk, or a tablet, scholars cannot simply point to the thing / concept 
“religion”  and  thereby  make  the  referent  of  the  term  more  or  less  clear  to  all 
with whom they would communicate. Scholars therefore must devise a technical 
definition. As one might imagine, there are no shortages of these in the litera-
ture. Classic theorists often looked to the supposed content of religion (substan-
tivist definitions) or what religion putatively does (functionalist definitions) for 
help.2 Attempts to define religion substantively may isolate one essential feature 
(an essentialist definition) that really captures the essence of religion (e.g., Fra-
zer thought belief in divine beings was the essential ingredient) or may enumer-
ate a series of family resemblances a number of which every example of religion 
will have. Attempts to define religion functionally tend to look for what religion 
does for/to its adherents: it provides psychological comfort (Freud), creates so-
cial solidarity (Durkheim), formulates “a general order of existence” that estab-
lishes  “uniquely  realistic”  “moods  and  motivations”  via  a  “system  of  symbols” 
(Geertz),3 or creates a “false consciousness” (an ideology) that veils the true na-
ture of economic exploitation of the masses by the owners of the means of pro-
duction (Marx). Functionalist definitions may also take an essentialist approach, 
arguing  that  one  function  really  explains  what  religion  does  and  thereby  cap-
tures its true nature or essence.  

Both approaches have had their problems and detractors. Substantivist defi-
nitions might evoke accusations of prejudice, political bias, arbitrariness, or cir-
cularity.  One  might  easily  ask  why  a  belief  (intellectual  assent)  should  define 
religion instead of, for example, a set of behaviors, or why a majority of broad 
features found in the (assumed) major world religions today should define reli-
gion universally (and from the past).4 Even  as functionalist definitions provide 
insight into those activities deemed religious, they run the risk of being applied 
in  a  metaphysically  reductionistic  manner;  that  is,  they  may  explain  religion

away as nothing but psychology, sociology, biology, etc.5 Or, functionalist defi-
nitions may fail to clarify how their proposed understanding of religion identi-
fies a distinctive subset of human activity. Watching a football game or attend-
ing a  rock concert can  create social  solidarity. Are these examples of religion? 
Finally, in as much as substantivist and functionalist definitions attempt to cir-
cumscribe the genuine essence of a “transhistorical and transcultural phenome-
non,”  they  may  reflect  a  kind  of  epistemological  idealism  and/or  conceal  an 
implicit theological assumption on the part of their wielder.6 

Given these problems and pitfalls of defining the concept, some scholars re-
fuse  to  define  religion  at  all and  content  themselves  with deconstructing what 
people  might mean  by  the  term.7  Others,  such  as  Jonathan  Z.  Smith,  have  ar-
gued that scholars simply ought to recognize that religion as such does not actu-
ally,  objectively  exist  in  space  and  time  but  can  be  understood  as  something 
constructed by scholars and wielded usefully as an analytical category for under-
standing cultural data (i.e., observable human activities and the products there-
of).8  In  this  case,  the  ideas  and  perspectives  offered  by  substantivist  and  func-
tionalist  definitions,  without  their  absolutist  claims,  may  be  incorporated  into 
this approach in an eclectic manner, if such ideas and perspectives are deemed 
useful for the scholar’s purposes. This latter option is adopted here. 

Before  deciding  how  to  construct  this  category  called  religion,  it  is  im-
portant to note that the recognition of “religion” and its continued use among 
scholars as a useful category for understanding human culture are the product of 
a specific confluence of historical circumstances in the West, especially the Eu-
ropean  Enlightenment.9  This  need  not  negate  religion’s  analytical  usefulness, 
since  every  concept  is  a  product  of  some  place  and  time  and  has  a  history.10 

 
5  It is well-known, e.g., that Durkheim, Freud, and Marx, all three major figures in functionalist 
approaches to religion, were ardent atheists and believed their theories explained transcendental 
religious claims away. For the important distinction between metaphysical and methodological 
(see below) reductionism, see Russel T. McCutcheon, Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public 
Study of Religion (Issues in the Study of Religion; Albany: State University of New York, 2001), x–
xi. 
6  “Transhistorical and transcultural phenomenon” are the words of Talal Asad, quoted in Arnal, 
“Definition,” 30. The work of Mircea Eliade, an important and popular twentieth century histori-
an of religion, is often criticized for its implicit theological assumption (see, e.g., Pals, Eight The-
ories of Religion, 223). 
7  This  is  Arnal’s  preference  (“Definition,”  30).  See  also  Timothy  Fitzgerald’s  provocative  The 
Ideology of Religious Studies (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000). 
8  Jonathan Z. Smith, Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago Studies in the Histo-
ry of Judaism; Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1982), xi. Human claims about 
the gods and their actions, for example, are observable and therefore count as data. 
9  This is argued forcefully by Talal Asad, Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power 
in Christianity and Islam  (Baltimore:  The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993),  especially  27–
54, who dismantles Geertz’s once dominant definition of religion. For details about the struggle 
of the philosophes against Christianity, see, e.g., Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation, 
vol. 1, The Rise of Modern Paganism (New York: Knopf, 1967).

Moreover,  without  some  kind  of  categorization,  one  simply  cannot  begin  any 
intellectual  undertaking—how  would  one  know  what  to  look  for?11  But  it  is 
worth  considering that  our  analytical  awareness to  mark religion  out  as  a  dis-
tinct element in culture is the result of historical struggles in which the cultural 
hegemony of specific institutions in Europe, notably the churches, receded and 
made  room  for  secular  cultural  institutions  and  activities.  In  a  rather  unusual 
turn of cultural events, that which is called religion in the West lost its unques-
tioned position  of primacy in  the public  sphere (e.g.,  the separation of Church 
and State was only thinkable  in a post-Enlightenment context) and has largely 
retreated to  the private sector.12 The recognition of this contemporary cultural 
context should urge caution when approaching a non-Western, non-modern cul-
ture such as ancient Mesopotamia, where one might reasonably ask, in light of 
our  modern  situation  and  definition  offered  below,  “What  is  not  religious  in 
Mesopotamia?”13 

The purpose of providing a definition in this introduction is to create a use-
ful heuristic mechanism, a filter that serves our descriptive and interpretive pur-
poses by identifying a subset of human cultural activity as religious.14 Due to the 
limits  of  time,  skills,  technology,  interests,  observable  data,  and  perhaps  our 
inability to see beyond our own prejudices, defining religion in this mode will be 
limited and limiting in its scope. In other words, this understanding of definition 
is  methodologically  reductionistic.  Methodological  reductionism,  according  to 
McCutcheon,  means one’s definitional stance is prefaced as follows: “given my 
methods/theories, the discursive rules of our institution, and my particular set of 
 
11  See Jonathan Z. Smith, “Classification,” 43, where he concludes his essay with this statement: 
“the rejection of classificatory interest is, at the same time, a rejection of thought.” 
12  These statements are not intended to negate the fact that religious people and groups continue 
to have a substantial impact on the public sphere. They clearly do. But their influence in, e.g., 
the  United  States,  is  not  due  to  a  State-sanctioned,  privileged  position.  Even  in  some  places 
where a Christian church does have state sanction, reason seems to have trumped revelation on a 
large scale. See Paul Zuckerman, Society Without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us 
About Contentment (Albany: New York University Press, 2008). 
13  See Niek  Veldhuis’s comments in his book Religion, Literature, and Scholarship: The  Sumerian 
Composition Nanše and the Birds, with a catalogue of Sumerian bird names (Cuneiform Monographs 
22;  Leiden/Boston:  Styx/Brill,  2004),  11–13.  Bruce  Lincoln’s  essay  “Culture”  in  A  Guide  to  the 
Study  of  Religion  (ed.  Willi  Braun  and  Russell  T.  McCutcheon;  London  and  New  York:  Cassell, 
2000), 409–22 provides a useful model for thinking about culture. Culture, according to Lincoln, 
may be considered to be composed of two major domains of human preferences: ethics (what is 
good) and aesthetics (what is pleasing). These two domains are always present in culture. Reli-
gion,  as  he  defines  it  (see  below),  is  a  third,  potential  component  that  does  not  offer  unique 
content (for ethics and aesthetics subsume all cultural content) but authorizes particular ethical 
and  aesthetic preferences in a  way  that gives them supra-human or  transcendent  authority.  In 
some cultures, religion plays this role minimally, affecting relatively few or only private prefer-
ences; in others, it has maximal effect, touching nearly every ethical and aesthetic preference a 
person holds. Mesopotamian cultures, according to this model, would fall on the “maximal” side 
of the spectrum. 
14  The same caveat applies to the definitions of “prayer” and “hymn” developed below, which 
should not be understood as natural categories but constructs used for analytical purposes.

interests and curiosities, religion turns out to be. . . .”15 Moreover, such a defini-
tion should be held as provisional, a starting point; it should undergo refinement 
and adjustment as new data are examined, the definition’s limitations explored, 
and one’s interests and focus change. 

Given the complexity of human activity in general, a multi-faceted or poly-
thetic definition of religion may be more useful than one that attempts to home 
in on a single feature or two. Bruce Lincoln offers the following helpful perspec-
tive on the matter: 

 
Briefly, I take religion to include four different components, which can re-
late  to  one  another  in  various  ways,  including  disjuncture  and  contradiction. 
These components are: 

1. A discourse that claims its concerns transcend the human, temporal and 
contingent, while claiming for itself a similarly transcendent status. 
2. A set of practices informed and structured by that discourse. 
3. A community, whose members construct their identity with reference to 
the discourse and its attendant practices. 
4. An institution that regulates discourse, practices and community, repro-
ducing and modifying them over time, while asserting their eternal validity 
and transcendent value.16 
 

Turning to prayers and hymns and how they fit into Lincoln’s definition of 
religion, one might think they obviously and only belong to discourse. After all, 
prayer, in everyday language, is simply a kind of religious or ritual speech that 
communicates one’s concerns/petitions to a benevolent supra-human being  via 
words. Understood thus, prayer as a type of speech includes hymns, which con-
stitute a thematically more specific variety of prayer; namely, hymns communi-
cate  praise  (predominantly)  by  the  same  means.  A  prayer  considered  as  dis-
course,  alongside 
its  primary  and  obvious  purpose  of  communicating 
information  (one’s  own,  often  worldly  concerns  and  petitions)  to  the  supra-
human  addressee,  also  communicates  something  to  any  human  who  hears  its 
words, including the one praying. For prayers, as Sam Gill has stated, are often 
“composed for the purpose of edifying, instructing, and influencing people in the 
matters of dogma, belief, and tradition.”17 Thus, prayers contain the petitions of 
the supplicant but may also convey to people authoritatively “concerns [such as 
theological  truths,  that]  transcend  the  human,  temporal  and  contingent.”  Fur-
thermore, given the general sources from which one learns to pray (e.g., a scrip-
ture [Matt 6:5–13, Luke 11:1–13; Deut 6:4–9; Sura 1], an official prayerbook, a

but a partial understanding.” This statement  occurs in his section “Prayer as  Act”; speaking is 
practice, too.

priest  of  a  god,  an  authoritative  adult,  a  myth,  and/or  a  normative  tradition 
handed down from the ancestors), it is not difficult to see how liturgical/ritual 
prayer, even spontaneous prayer to the extent that it is shaped by an authorita-
tive  model,18  may  at  least  implicitly  claim  “for  itself  a  similarly  transcendent 
status.”  

Related  to  this  discourse  perspective,  one  may  also  consider  prayers  and 
hymns as a form of practice because the words spoken in a prayer have illocu-
tionary  effects  (i.e.,  they  do  things).  The  very  act  of  uttering  the  words  of  a 
hymn is to give honor, and the very act of directing words or petitions to a deity 
is to seek assistance. But there is more to prayer/praise as practice than an act of 
communication that may  also give honor or seek assistance. In  as much as  ac-
tions (rituals, gestures, posture, comportment, etc.) are prescribed to accompany 
the  verbal  act,  prayers  or  hymns  display  other  aspects  of  religious  practice. 
These actions, just like the forms of speech used in prayers, are historically and 
culturally conditioned and may shed significant light on a prayer when consid-
ered alongside its other features. 

Prayers  as  discourse/practice complexes  are  always spoken  in  a  particular 
social context, a community, which is implicitly or explicitly under the guidance 
and (often but not always) authority of institutions (e.g., temples) and communi-
ty  leaders  (e.g.,  parents,  priests,  elders,  a  headman,  etc.).19  Considering  the 
communal  and  the  institutional  context of  prayer  helps  one  see  its  various  as-
pects that extend beyond the individual supplicant. As noted earlier in the cita-
tion of Gill, when considering prayer as discourse, the wording of prayers often 
contain more than the communication of one’s personal concerns; they may also 
instruct and exhort others. “Such aspects of prayer,” Gill writes, “must be recog-
nized as important and often essential to the continuity and communication of 
tradition  and  culture.  In  its  capacity  of  performing  these  important  functions, 
the formulaic, repetitive, and standardized characteristics of prayer are effective 
pedagogically  and  to  enculturate.”20  In  other  words,  prayer  as  discourse  and 
practice is often institutionally prescribed or encouraged as a means of perpetu-
ating  or  reshaping,  in  times  of  liturgical  reform,  the  community.  When  one 
prays, one participates in a community and perpetuates its institutional values, 
relevance, and power in society. To modify Donne’s famous line, no supplicant is 
an island unto themselves. 

Lincoln’s definition of religion brings into focus, therefore, how prayers are 
more than texts. They are part and parcel of a whole network of social activities 
that reflect and perpetuate the broader social formation that uses them. Failing 

 
18  Note Gill’s generalization in this regard: “the record of personal prayers found in letters, biog-
raphies, and diaries suggests a strong correlation and interdependence of personal prayer with 
ritual and liturgical prayer in language, form, style, and physical attitude” (ibid., 490). 
19  Even the person praying spontaneously while completely alone will have had some communal 
and institutional influence. How else would they know how to pray or to whom to direct it?

to  take  these  aspects  into  consideration  explicitly  when  reading  prayers  and 
hymns—even if the evidence for determining the details of a practice, communi-
ty,  or  institution  is  more  limited  than  one  would  like—may  lead  to  failing  to 
understand  fully  or  seriously  misunderstanding  the  prayers  one  reads  and  the 
humans who produced and/or utilized them. 

PRAYERS AND HYMNS IN A GENERAL MESOPOTAMIAN PERSPECTIVE: 

Although this book focuses  on  language and  on  increasing one’s Akkadian 
fluency,  the  above  brief remarks provide  a  conceptual  starting point for  going 
beyond  reading  Mesopotamian  prayers  and  hymns  as  texts  that  simply  “speak 
for themselves.” It moves the reader toward interpreting prayers and hymns in a 
multi-faceted manner as cultural artifacts situated in a subset of human activities 
identified as religious. But all of this raises an initial question that needs to be 
explored: How does one identify a prayer or a hymn when reading an Akkadian 
text?  Although  this  is  not  the  place  to  present  a  complete  discussion  of  what 
might constitute a genus “Mesopotamian ritual speech” of which “prayer” might 
be distinguished as a species, some consideration of this issue is in order. 

One could begin to answer this question of identification with an appeal to 
particular textual details such as scribal rubrics (a label at the end of a text) or 
superscripts (a label at the head of a text) that the ancient scribes used to identi-
fy  and  classify  their  own  writings.  In  other  words,  one  could  identify  prayers 
based on the Mesopotamians’ own ideas of classifying prayers. Potential candi-
dates of such scribal metadata could include én, én-é-nu-ru, šu-íla, tamītu, ikribu, 
ér-šà-ḫun-gá,  nam-búr-bi,  nam-érim-búr-ru-da,  uš11-búr-ru-da,  dingir-šà-dib-ba, 
etc.  Having  identified  these,  one  could  then  populate  the  categories  of  prayer 
and hymn based on an indigenous classification. Unfortunately, the indigenous 
labels are often problematic in their own right (see the extensive discussion of 
the shuilla-rubric below), and not every text bears one, thus potentially depriv-
ing the dataset of some relevant texts. Moreover, while some rubrics, for exam-
ple, ikribu, might be translated generically as “prayer,” there is no native classi-
fier  that  corresponds  to  the  broad  categories  of  prayers  and  hymns  proposed 
here. Thus, there is a more fundamental problem with this well-meaning meth-
odology: one must already know what a prayer/hymn is before one can identify 
the indigenous superscripts or rubrics that would supposedly populate the cate-
gory with texts. Rather than using tacit notions of prayer and hymn as a guide, 
one might instead simply recognize that one is guided initially in the classifica-
tory endeavor by specific definitions arising from one’s own sphere and then to 
refine and clarify these definitions in interaction with the data  that is encoun-
tered from the ancient world. In other words, in proposing to treat certain Akka-
dian texts as prayers and hymns, the modern reader must impose their own ide-

as upon them initially.21 But as the modern reader works with the texts, a pro-
cess is initiated in which one attempts to understand them with increasing preci-
sion within their own cultural contexts. Ideally, this process will in turn lead to 
improvements in the models/definitions one uses to translate and interpret the 
texts in and for the contemporary sphere. 

An  initial  foray  into  the  subject  might  begin  with  an  everyday  notion  of 
prayer and hymn as mentioned above. A prayer, to start with, is a kind of reli-
gious,  ritual  form  of  speech  that  communicates  one’s  concerns/petitions  to  a 
benevolent supra-human being (or more than one being) via words; a hymn is a 
similar communication with a narrower thematic focus: petition is either lacking 
or very restricted while praise and adoration (the expression of a different kind 
of concern) dominate the text. The boundary between the two is not hard and 
fast. Despite the fuzzy boundary, these initial definitions are useful for the pre-
sent analytical purpose. But there are some aspects of the definitions that raise 
important questions that deserve fuller consideration. In the attempt to answer 
these questions, the definition of prayer offered above will develop toward one 
that more suitably fits the Mesopotamian data. 

First, what does benevolent supra-human being mean in polytheistic ancient Mes-
opotamia?22 In Mesopotamia there were a great many entities that were not hu-
man,  though  characterized  anthropomorphically,23  and  had  powers  that  went 
well-beyond  normal  human  capacity.  These  supra-human  beings  included 
ghosts, gods, protective spirits (e.g., lamassū and šēdū), demons, witches, certain 
cult-objects, and others (e.g., the apkallū, “primordial semi-divine sages”).24 Hu-
mans could use ritual speech to communicate with all of these beings; descrip-

 
21  Although this point is a commonplace among social scientific and religious studies scholars, it 
seems  to  be  resisted  by  ancient  historians.  See  classicist  Sarah  Iles  Johnston’s  review  article 
“Describing  the  Undefinable:  New  Books  on Magic and Old Problems of Definition,” History of 
Religions 43.1 (2003), 50–54, especially 54 for the same conclusion as presented above. In her 
concluding remarks, she offers an important reason for imposing our own categories on the data 
we study. She says that “without etic categories [that is, categories defined by the outside inves-
tigator], however provisional, the Hellenist is unable to talk to the Assyriologist, the Egyptologist 
to the scholar of Judaism.” In other words, if our work is to be meaningful and informative be-
yond the insular world of our own fields of study, constructing meaningful categories that com-
municate across contemporary academic boundaries is absolutely essential. 
22  We could, of course, have asked something similar about our own contemporary setting in the 
earlier general discussion, but such was unnecessary for our present purposes.  
23  One can see the anthropomorphism even in the incantation-prayer addressed to salt (see page 
189) and in the one to the horse that pulls Marduk’s chariot in W. G. Lambert, Babylonian Oracle 
Questions (Mesopotamian Civilizations 13; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2007), no. 9, lines 15–27.

Institute 2; Chebeaugue Island, ME: Casco Bay Assyriological Institute, 2009) for ancient Meso-
potamia.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

tions of such communication as well as the actual texts that contain these com-
munications are well-attested. Many of these powerful beings could be both be-
nevolent and malevolent toward a human. Enlil, for example, could be gracious 
or vindictive; family ghosts could be implored for help or ritually expelled to the 
netherworld; the apkallū, the sages of Ea, could assist or afflict humans; Pazuzu 
was to be feared in his own right as a demon but could also be utilized for apo-
tropaic  purposes  against  Lamashtu.25  In  order  for  a  definition  of  prayer  to  be 
useful in Mesopotamia, it needs to specify that “benevolent supra-human being,” 
for the present purposes, refers to any supra-human being to whom a text directs 
itself and about whom the text assumes, implicitly or explicitly, sufficient power 
to  aid  the  speaker.  Because  the  text  expresses  hope  for  a  beneficent  response, 
one might find words of deference or honor addressed to the supra-human pow-
er at the beginning of the communication (see below, for example, on the struc-
ture of the incantation-prayer). This text-centered orientation makes speculation 
about  an  actual  speaker’s  subjective  intention  or  emotion  irrelevant.  The  per-
spective and warrants of the text are all that is accessible to modern readers.  

Because  the present  definition  defines  prayer  as  something  directed  to  be-
nevolent  supra-human  powers,  texts  that  communicate  concerns  or  desires  to 
malevolent  demons,  ghosts,  witches,  illnesses,  and  other  powerful  entities  are 
not prayers. The same applies to texts that address themselves to mere humans 
or no one in particular, benevolent or otherwise. These texts use forms of ritual 
speech,  to  be  sure  (see  below);  but  an  investigation  of  the  broader  domain  of 
“Mesopotamian  ritual  speech”  goes  beyond  the  present  purpose,  which  is  fo-
cused  on  the  narrower  categories  of  Mesopotamian  prayer  and  the  even  more 
focused category of hymn or praise. Other forms of ritual speech will be brought 
into the present discussion only in so far as they help delineate the conceptual 
parameters of prayer and praise by way of contrast (see fig. 1). 

Second, does the descriptor “communication via words” in the  initial definition 
do  justice  to  the  Mesopotamian  data  about  prayer  and  praise?  Despite  the promi-
nence  and  therefore  usefulness  that  verbal  communication  has  for  the  present 
purpose  (this  book  does  after  all  deal  with  language),  the  answer  is  negative. 
“Communication via words” does Mesopotamian prayer justice no more than it 
). Throughout the 
does justice to the contemporary Muslim practice of ṣalāt (
ancient Near East, texts that contain or describe prayers and hymns—recognized 
as such by the initial definition given above—often record or prescribe various 
bodily  gestures.  These  may  include  prostration,  raising  one’s  hands,  kneeling, 
lifting   up   one’s    head,   facing oneself toward a temple,  etc.  as   well   as   ritual   acts

such  as  setting up  altars, making  offerings,  applying  substances  to  one’s  body, 
and manipulating objects (e.g., figurines or other items) before, during, and/or 
after  the recitation  of  the  verbal  communication.  For  a  variety  of reasons,  the 
descriptions of such practices may not be preserved with the texts to be recited 
and  so  may  not  be  as  easily  identified.  Nevertheless,  attending  to  these  other 
features—and  therefore  adjusting  the  definition  of  prayer  in  light  of  them—is 
important in order to avoid a truncated understanding of Mesopotamian prayer 
and praise. In  order to capture the discourse/practice complex that is Mesopo-
tamian  prayer,  it  is  advisable  to  think  about  most  prayers  as  “ritual-prayers,” 
comprising dromena, that which is done, and legomena, that which is spoken.26 

Further, a definition of Mesopotamian prayer should avoid making commu-
nication via words a central or essential feature. Obviously the verbal or textual 
side of prayer is important for the purposes of this volume. Yet this focus should 
not unduly limit one’s view of Mesopotamian prayer and praise. Although non-
verbal prayer is not explored in this volume, it is important to keep in mind that 
a  votive  statue  placed  in  a  temple  or  a  cylinder  seal  depicting  a  presentation 
scene may represent a petitioner’s attempt to express their concerns or praise to 
a benevolent being visually, a manner completely lacking any linguistic form of 
communication.27  

 
26  There are exceptions. Some prayers, e.g., the prayers used in royal building inscriptions, do 
not as far as we know have a ritual element. 
27  For general  remarks on  votive statues, see, e.g., Dominique Collon, Ancient Near Eastern Art 
(Berkeley  and  Los  Angeles:  University  of  California  Press,  1995),  60–62,  with  a  photo  of  the 
famous Tell Asmar votive statues; on presentation scenes, see her Near Eastern Seals (Interpreting 
the Past; Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1990), 46–47. We should not 
neglect to mention the fact that some cylinder seal legends (inscriptions) contained actual pray-
ers  in  Sumerian  and  Akkadian.  Although  probably  not  intended  for  speaking  aloud,  these  in-
scribed  supplications  were  “recited”  with  each  impression  of  the  seal.  For  many  examples  of 
these  silent  prayers,  see  Henri  Limet,  Les  legendes  de  sceaux  cassites  (Académie  royale  de  Bel-
gique, Classe des letters: Mémoires LX/2; Bruxelles: Palais des Académies, 1971).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Third, does the phrase “one’s concerns/petitions” adequately capture all that one 
might see in Mesopotamian texts identified as prayers? No. One might suggest that 
petitions, easily identified since they are usually expressed  grammatically with 
imperatives or precatives, are essential to identifying and understanding prayers 
because supplicants seem always to present at least one request in the course of a 
prayer and sometimes many, many more (as in, e.g., Nebuchadnezzar’s prayer to 
Nabu on page 475).28 But petitions sometimes comprise a tiny fraction of what 
one sees in a prayer. For example, in Nabu 1 (see page 325), the petition consists 
of  only  one  line in  twenty,  a  mere five percent. Moreover,  hymns,  a  subset  of 
prayer, may not contain a petition at all, but occupy themselves with enumerat-
ing  the  character  and  actions  of  the  deity.  Although  one  might  say  that  con-
cerns/petitions capture important aspects of the content of prayers and hymns, it 
would be a mistake to absolutize these as the exclusive content of what is com-
municated in the texts. What else therefore might a Mesopotamian prayer/hymn 
generally contain?  

Although an exhaustive listing is not appropriate here (in some cases, more 
detail will be presented when various kinds of prayers are introduced), the fol-
lowing are important general elements one will find in the texts. Mesopotamian 
prayers normally begin with an invocation of the deity by name, which identi-
fies the benevolent supra-human being to whom the prayer is directed. Just as 
one  might  speak  one’s  friend’s  name  aloud  in  a  group  to  gain  their  attention 
before conversing with them, the invocation is intended to get the supra-human 
being’s  attention  before the prayer  continues  on to other matters.  Prayers  also 
often  contain  praise.  Along  with  the  invocation,  for  example,  one  may  see  a 
hymnic introduction in which the supplicant praises the deity invoked via a list 
of divine epithets, attributes, actions, or other features. This introductory praise 
functions as a  kind of formal  greeting, a social protocol utilized  when a social 
inferior approaches a social superior with an unsolicited address (see the discus-
sion of shuillas below). When this hymnic element is present, the length varies 
significantly from as little as one line to a dozen or more. Prayers may also end 
with  praise  of  thanksgiving,  or  rather,  a  promise  to  give  the  deity  thanks  via 
verbal (see, e.g., the end of incantation-prayers) and/or other ritual means (see, 
e.g., the animal sacrifices in the OB letter-prayer to Ninmug on page 105). In the 
subset of prayer  identified here as hymn, praise predominates throughout. An-
other  common  element  of  content  in  prayers  is  the  self-presentation  or  self-
introduction  formula,  in  which  the  supplicant  identifies  their  name,  filiation, 
and perhaps personal gods. The supplicant may also voice their concerns in the 
form of complaints or laments about the problems that have given them reason 
to seek supra-human assistance.29 During the course of praising, complaining to, 
 
28  Moreover, hymns are not entirely devoid of petition. See, e.g., the OB hymn to Ishtar on page 
111. 
29  Cultic laments such as balags and ershemmas, composed in Sumerian and used liturgically by 
the kalû, “cult-singer,” fall outside the purview of this study. The ershaḫunga-prayers, however,

or petitioning the deity or in their promise of thanksgiving the supplicant may 
refer to various ritual actions they have performed, are performing, or will per-
form. These descriptions in the text of the prayer are not always identical to or 
do not always seem to correspond to the ritual instructions that may accompa-
ny  the text.  (The  ritual  instructions may  be listed  in  a separate  section  on  the 
tablet at the end of the prayer or written on a separate ritual tablet altogether in 
the case of prayers that belong to long ritual series such as Maqlû.) The reason 
for what seems to be an imperfect correspondence may be due to the fact that 
the precise meaning of a ritual act mentioned in the prayer is not fully under-
stood  (e.g.,  sissikta  ṣabātu,  “to  seize  the  hem”),  that  the  ritual  instructions  are 
truncated or entirely lacking,  the prayer or ritual has undergone scribal devel-
opment, leaving evidence of such in the resulting mismatch, and/or that the text 
assumes the specialist would have known certain routine procedures and there-
fore did not record them (e.g., when to bow, when to kneel, etc.). But there are 
numerous instances of the contrary situation; that is, there are texts that show a 
close  correspondence  between  ritual  actions  mentioned  in  the  prayer  and  the 
ritual instructions (see, e.g., Nusku 12 on page 179).30 

Fourth, despite the complexities of the issue, it is an important and worth-
while  exercise  to  revisit  the  earlier  concern  with  indigenous  categorization  of 
texts and ask, Does the definition of Mesopotamian textual prayer developed here jibe 
with  the  various  Mesopotamian  categorization  of  texts  (i.e.,  the  scribal  metadata)? 
And if not, should this be a concern? To the first question, the answer will have to 
be a firm no; the present definition actually cuts  across various Mesopotamian 
scribal categories. The answer to the  second question should probably be both 
yes  and  no.  It  should  be  a  concern  that  the  present  definition  does  not  corre-
spond to any ancient category and one ought to remain aware of the fact that a 
modern  scholarly  conceptualization  of  categories  is  different  from  the  indige-
nous Mesopotamian ones. On the other hand, it is the prerogative of the inter-
preter  to  establish  what  seem  to  be  productive  avenues  of  cultural  interpreta-
tion, including how to categorize and organize data so that it will communicate 
with contemporaries. Indigenous  sources are  just  that,  sources. They should of 
course inform contemporary scholarship; but they should not dictate the interpre-
tive results.31 The brief discussion in the next several paragraphs will show via 

 
also part of kalûtu, “the craft of the cult-singer,” are discussed below. Although the balags and 
ershemmas were also given interlinear Akkadian translations by ancient scribes, the ershaḫungas 
were included in this volume because they have affinities with some of the monolingual Akkadi-
an penitential prayers for individuals (i.e., the dingirshadibbas and the shuilla Marduk 4). More-
over, the one ershaḫunga-prayer treated in this volume, the prayer to any god (see page 447), 
has appeared in various anthologies of Mesopotamian/Akkadian prayers.  
30  See the more detailed statement on page 32. 
31  When our ancient sources are allowed to determine or dictate to us our interpretive results, 
we have moved from being an ancient historian to a curator or caretaker of antiquity. See Bruce 
Lincoln, “Theses on Method,” Method & Theory in the Study of Religion 8 (1996), 225–27 (reprint-
ed in MTSR 17 [2005], 8–10).

concrete examples  how the present categorization of prayer  cuts across known 
Mesopotamian  scribal  categories  and  how  this  informs  and  refines  the  present 
understanding of prayer. The discussion will also suggest, however, that there is 
an  interpretive  benefit  in  maintaining  modern  constructions  of  categorization 
despite  the  important  ancient  scribal  rubrics  and  superscripts  that  have  come 
down to us. 

Consider the following two texts. Each is the ritual wording of a (different) 
shaziga-ritual that was used to remedy a man’s sexual impotence. The Sumerian 
term šà-zi-ga (Akk. nīš libbi, “rising of the heart”) was the rubric scribes used to 
classify the purpose of these rituals. They normally placed the rubrics at the end 
of the text. The superscript én, discussed further below, marks the beginning of 
the ritual’s wording recited in the course of the ritual. 

én: Let the wind blow (lillik)! Let the grove quake (linūš). 
Let the clouds gather (lištakṣir)! Let the moisture fall (littuk)! 
Let my potency be (lū) flowing river water! 
Let my penis be (lū) a (taut) harp string 
So that it will not slip out of her! tu6 én.32  

én: O Adad, canal inspector of heaven, son of Anu, 
Who gives oracular decisions for all people, the protector of the land, 
At your supreme command which cannot be opposed, 
And your faithful affirmation which cannot be altered, 
May NN son of NN, become stiff (limgug)33 for NN, daughter of NN,  
may he come into contact with (limḫaṣ), mount (lirkab), and  
penetrate (lišērib) (her)! tu6 én.34 
The  second  text  begins  with  an  invocation  of  a  supra-human  being;  there 
are several honorific epithets and statements intended to glorify the deity; and 
the text concludes with a complex petition (note the four precatives) for the dei-
ty to act upon. It becomes clear in the course of the prayer that the deity is con-
strued  as  benevolent  because  a)  he  is  assumed  to  be  interested  in  hearing  the 
prayer and b) he is assumed to be capable of acting upon it for the benefit of the 
supplicant.  This  text  is  clearly  a  prayer  according  to  the  definition  developed 
above (more specifically, modern scholars call this text an “incantation-prayer,” 
about which see page 24 below).35  

 
32  Robert D. Biggs, Šà.zi.ga: Ancient Mesopotamian Potency Incantations (TCS 2; Locust Valley: J. J. 
Augustin, 1967), 35 (text no. 15). Line 19, the last line of the ritual,  gives the purpose of this 
ritual-prayer as šà-zi-ga. The translation is Biggs’, only slighted adjusted here and in the follow-
ing in that I have not translated the opening and closing formulae (én and tu6 én). 
33  CAD A/140 notes an emendation to Biggs’ text that I have incorporated here: li-e-gu-ug should 
be read li-im!-gu-ug. 
34  Biggs, Šà.zi.ga, 42 (text no. 23). Line 13 gives the following rubric after the wording and be-
fore the ritual: ka-inim-ma šà-zig-ga, “the wording of a shaziga.” NN is a placeholder, meaning 
“so-and-so.” The actual names of the people involved would be filled in during the ritual. 
35  Mayer, UFBG, 378 identifies this incantation-prayer as Adad 8. 

 

INTRODUCTION

As for the first text, the agent to whom it is directed, if any at all, is unclear; 
there is no invocation. The text does, however, contain what one might call peti-
tions  (note  the  four  precatives  and  the  two  uses  of  lū).  These  statements  are 
grammatically identical to what one sees in the petitions of the second text. In 
fact, the precatives in the first shaziga dominate the text even more so. But the 
precatives in this first text have a more general character than those in the sec-
ond. Although the precatives in both texts express the speaker’s desires (wishes, 
hopes), only those in the second may be further qualified as petitions since peti-
tions by definition require the involvement of one thought capable of responding 
(the  addressee,  Adad).  As  there  is  no  invocation  of  a  benevolent  supra-human 
being to act upon the precatives in the first text, they remain conceptually at a 
more general level of  expressed desire.  Because it  lacks an invocation of  a be-
nevolent supra-human being, praise, and petition the first shaziga, according to 
the  present  definition,  is  not  a  prayer  (or  hymn);  rather,  it  is  another  form  of 
ritual speech.  

To be sure, both texts belong to the corpus of shaziga-rituals, designated by 
a common rubric; both texts were used for the same general remedial purpose. 
But only the second one qualifies as a prayer according to the definition devel-
oped  above.  One  might  be  inclined  to  adjust  one’s  definition  of  prayer  to  ac-
count for this mismatch between the modern definition and the ancient rubrics. 
This is, of course, one way to allow the evidence to re-shape the heuristic defini-
tion. The following paragraphs, however, will suggest that such is unnecessary 
and ultimately may be unhelpful to the larger interpretive project. 
 
The two examples of shazigas bring up another, more general (and trouble-
some)  scribal  label  that  illustrates  how  the  present  definition  of  prayer  cuts 
across  Mesopotamian  categories:  the  Sumerian  superscript  én  or  én-é-nu-ru  in 
OB and older texts.36 These Sumerian terms are equivalent to the Akkadian term 
šiptu and translated into English, conventionally and unfortunately, as “incanta-
tion.”37  As  was  stated  earlier,  there  are  a  great  many  ritual  texts  in  Akkadian 
that  contain  prescribed  words  to  communicate  concerns  or  desires  to  demons, 
ghosts, witches, illnesses, and other malevolent things/forces. These texts usual-
ly communicate a desire for protection from (apotropaism) or the expulsion of 
(exorcism) these forces. The following is a representative example: 

én: Fire, fire! 
Fire seized a lone man. 
It seized (his) insides, (his) temple,

(Stupia Pohl: Series Maior 17; Roma: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1997) for a catalog and analyt-
ical study. 
37  The translation is unfortunate because “incantation” has been closely associated with magic, 
paganism, primitivism, and generally those things that are “other” to “true” religion (especially 
as defined by Protestant Europeans). For the intellectual background to such issues in the West, 
see Stanley Tambiah, Magic, Science, Religion, and the Scope of Rationality (Cambridge: Cambridge 
University Press, 1990), 1–41.

from the firmament of the depths. 

It spread (to others) the gnawing of (his) insides, 
The stock of the human race was diminished. 
Belet-ili went before Ea the king, 
“O Ea, humankind was created by your spell, 
“Second, you pinched off their clay 
 
“By your great command, you determined their capacities. 
“I cast a spell on the …-disease, fever, boils, 
“Leprosy(?), jaundice! 
“Rain down like dew, 
“Flow down like tears, 
“Go down to the netherworld!” 
This incantation is an incantation of Belet-ili, the great queen.38 

Although these kinds of texts are clearly excluded from the present understand-
ing  of  prayer  because  they  are  directed  at malevolent  (here,  an  illness)  rather 
than benevolent powers, they often bear one of the two Sumerian superscripts, 
én or én-é-nu-ru, under discussion. There are a number of other texts that also 
bear one of these superscripts but are directed at such things as an animal, the 
wind, a would-be human lover, and in some cases nothing clearly discernible, as 
in the first shaziga cited above. Finally, as in the second shaziga cited, there are 
still other texts that bear the én superscript but also fit the present definition of 
prayer.  In  fact,  nearly  all  of  the  SB  shuilla-  and  dingirshadibba-prayers  in  this 
volume  bear  the  én  superscript  (and  are  therefore  usually  called  “incantation-
prayers”  by  contemporary  scholars).  Besides  recognizing  that  our  constructed 
category of prayer cuts across another indigenous Mesopotamian scribal catego-
ry, this fact calls for some deeper reflection about how the notion of prayer that 
is developed here relates to the ancient Mesopotamian category of ritual speech 
labeled én—a Sumerian. term often translated simply as “incantation” but better 
rendered “ritual wording.”39 

First,  applying  an  antiquated  Frazerian  dichotomy  between  “mechanical” 
magic and “personal” religion—personal in that volitional agents are involved—
should be resisted because it is not helpful in clarifying or explaining the texts.40 

 
38  See W. G. Lambert, “Fire Incantations,” AfO 23 (1970), 39–45 for an edition of the text and 
Foster, 971, whose translation is cited here. 
39  Despite the fact that “ritual wording” is probably a better translation of the terms én and šiptu, 
the conventional translation “incantation” is so entrenched in Assyriological scholarship that we 
have (hesitantly) opted to use this rendering throughout the volume. For how our modern notion 
of prayer does not correspond with the ancient superscript én, see briefly W. G. Lambert, “The 
Classification  of Incantations,”  in  Proceedings of  the  51st  Rencontre  Assyriologique Internationale, 
Held at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005 (ed. Robert D. Biggs, 
Jennie Myers, and Martha T. Roth;  SAOC  62;  Chicago:  Oriental  Institute, 2008), 93–97  (refer-
ence courtesy of Christopher Frechette). 
40  See Pals, Eight Theories of Religion, 31–51 for a brief summary and useful critique of Frazer’s 
views. See also Tambiah, Magic, Science, Religion, 18–20 for the intellectual genealogy of such a 
dichotomy. 

 

INTRODUCTION 

17

In discussing  these two shaziga-prayers above, their ancient scribal categoriza-
tion,  and  how  these  relate  to  a  modern  definition  of  prayer,  only  the  formal, 
linguistic  features  of  the  texts  have  been  addressed.  Both  shazigas—both  of 
which also bear the én superscript—are forms of ritual speech used for the same 
remedial purpose, and they “work” conceptually rather similarly, whatever one 
decides to call them in a modern system of classification. Note, for example, the 
ritual instructions that follow each of the two shazigas.41 Although the instruc-
tions for each text differ with regard to the accompanying ritual actions, they do 
agree that the ritual wording for each, identified on the tablet with the én super-
script  in  both  cases,  is  to  be  recited  seven  times.  Despite  their  respective  ad-
dressees (or lack thereof), both were apparently considered more effective when 
repeated multiple times. If repetition  of words is  associated with “mechanical” 
magic, as it often was among some past interpreters,42 then one would have to 
argue that the shaziga that the above definition identifies as a prayer (called an 
“incantation-prayer” by scholars today) is just as “magical” as the shaziga that 
the above definition dismisses from the category of prayer (and therefore is of-
ten simply called an “incantation” by modern scholars). In this case, therefore, 
the magic vs. religion model is not very helpful in making sense of the data. A 
better interpretation is to recognize that the common ritual instructions calling 
for repetition of these two shazigas point to conceptual similarities in the utiliza-
tion  of  these  two  examples  of  ritual  speech  (both  labeled  én  by  the  ancients), 
despite the modern distinction in seeing one as prayer and one as not-prayer.  

Another important point in this regard is that the involvement of a deity in 
a text labeled a prayer by modern scholarship does not necessarily impute to this 
form  of ritual  speech  a more  contingent  or  uncertain  efficaciousness  than  that 
associated with texts one might view as “mechanical” incantations. It would be a 
mistake to think that the supplicant nervously had to await the deity’s answer to 
the  shaziga  identified  as  a  prayer  but  could  feel  confident  that  the  other  text 
worked  automatically  against  whatever  or  whomever  it  was  directed.43  There 
are, to be sure, places where one reads of supplicants asking a deity to hear or 
accept  their  prayer  and  others  when  supplicants  mention  how  a  deity  has  ac-
cepted or heard their prayer.44 There are even complaints about unheeded pray-
ers (see Marduk 4, lines 3–4 on page 296). Clearly, the personal-agent-element 
of a prayer elicited talk from the Mesopotamians about prayer in terms of divine 

 
41  The ritual instructions are identified on the tablet by the typical indicator in Sumerian, dù-dù-
bi, “its ritual action.” The ritual instructions are generally placed immediately after the last line 
of the ritual wording. 
42  This was historically a problem among Protestant interpreters, who could appeal to Matt 6:7–
8 to support their position. 
43  There  are,  of  course,  cases  of  prayer  in  Mesopotamia  in  which  the  supplicants  do  await  a 
divine  response  (see,  e.g.,  the  tamitus).  But  this  is  due  to  the  particular  kind  of  prayer  being 
offered, one which accompanies an oracular extispicy. 
44  Several examples of both situations can be found under the words magāru (CAD M/1, 38–39), 
leqû (CAD L, 136–37), and šemû (CAD Š/2, 284–85), among others.

response or lack thereof. Indeed, the ancient Mesopotamians knew full well that 
the gods were sovereign over the affairs of humans; the gods ultimately decided 
if, when, and how a response to human supplication would occur (see Ludlul bēl 
nēmeqi, for example).45 But this need not contradict the fact that some (most?) 
prayers  seem  to  have  worked,  i.e.,  instilled  good  reason  for  the  supplicant  to 
have confidence that positive results had been gained for their petitions, simply 
by virtue of their being spoken. In other words, despite modern misgivings about 
inconsistency,  the  involvement  of  a  personal,  benevolent  agent  need  not  have 
ruled out a genuine confidence in the efficaciousness of a prayer.46 In fact, some 
ritual instructions for prayers actually state that after a specified number of reci-
tations of the text the supplicant’s prayer would be heard (see, e.g., Gula 1a, line 
28 on page 252). Such a statement can plausibly be interpreted as intended to 
instill  confidence  in  the  supplicant.47  (Of  course,  this  confident  expectation 
clashed sometimes with lived reality and resulted in dashed hopes and deep des-
pair, as we see  in Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 1–48. The sufferer does  everything right 
but sees nothing but wrong around him!) These points should again caution us 
from  drawing  an  overly-precise  conceptual  distinction  in  ancient  Mesopotamia 
between impersonal ritual speech directed at malevolent (or other kinds of) enti-
ties and ritual speech directed at personal and benevolent agents (i.e., what we 
are calling prayer). 

If  this  discussion  has  somewhat  blurred  the  conceptual  line  between  the 
forms of ritual speech that are often called “incantation” by modern scholars and 
the present category of “prayer” (including what modern scholars call “incanta-
tion-prayers”) then it is has achieved its purpose. 

It would, however, be a mistake, I think, simply to dissolve the conceptual 
boundaries between all Mesopotamian texts that the present definition identifies 
as  prayers  and  all  Mesopotamian  texts  that  follow  the  scribal  én  superscript. 
Though some of the texts called prayers here are identified by the Mesopotami-
ans as an én (thus the modern label “incantation-prayer”), there are many other 
texts that the present definition would identify as a prayer but do not bear the 
én label (e.g., the OB ikribu-like prayer, the NB royal prayer, and the OB letter-
prayer, to name three in this volume). Maintaining a distinct category of prayer 
 
45  See Maul’s statement in ZB, 74 and the observation by Claus Ambos, cited in note 99 below. 
See also the very interesting tamitu-prayer in which the supplicant queries Shamash and Adad 
regarding whether or not his penitential prayer (šigû) will be accepted by the gods. The reply, 
which  is  not  preserved,  would  have  been  given  via  extispicy.  See  W.  G.  Lambert,  Babylonian

based  on  a  modern  definition,  therefore,  helps  one  analytically  by  identifying 
and  including  these  other,  similar  texts  for  study  within  the  dataset.  (At  the 
same time, of course, one must keep in mind that the Mesopotamians themselves 
may have been baffled by such a lumping together of what to their minds were 
probably distinct groups of texts.) Furthermore, even among those texts catego-
rized as prayers by the definition that do in fact bear the én label, there are for-
mal features that mark a conceptual distinction between them and other forms 
of ritual speech (such as incantations directed against malevolent powers) that 
bear the én label. This calls for a brief explanation. 

If one surveys the various texts scholars call incantations, that is, the many 
texts bearing the scribal rubric én or én-é-nu-ru, one can generally see two op-
posing formal characteristics that distinguish incantation-prayers from the other 
incantation texts: the first concerns how the texts begin; the other, how the texts 
end. First, incantation-prayers invoke a supra-human power near the beginning 
of the text who will help, it is assumed, the supplicant achieve a favorable result 
for their petitions—a benevolent supra-human power. Non-prayer incantations, 
on the other hand, may announce at the beginning to what or whom the incan-
tation  addresses  itself,  but  the  addressee  is  not  invoked  to  help  achieve  the 
speaker’s expressed desires. Rather, the addressee is usually told what to do. Alt-
hough  incantation-prayers  may  use  imperatives,  they  do  so  typically  within  a 
framework that begins (and often ends) with praise, a sign of deference; the im-
peratives in  these texts, therefore, have quite a different tone than the  ones in 
non-prayer  incantations.  This  is  an  important  formal  difference  that  hints  at  a 
conceptual distinction. This distinction is clarified by the other formal character-
istic.48  

The second formal characteristic lies in the way the speaker of an incanta-
tion gained help for their ritual speech’s effectiveness: help came in the form of 
legitimation formulae, generally attached at the conclusion of an incantation, in 
which the incantation was asserted to be divine rather than human speech. The 
most common Akkadian examples include šiptu ul yuttun (yattun), “the incanta-
tion is not mine,” šipat DN, “(it is) the incantation of [some deity],” ina qibīt DN, 
 
48  A general survey—by no means exhaustive—of various terms for or used with supplication or 
beseeching  (atnu,  emēqu  [Št],  enēnu,  ikribu,  leqû,  magāru,  maḫāru,  naqbītu,  nīš  qāti,  qāta  našû, 
qibītu [see CAD Q, 246–47], sīpu, sullû [noun and verb], suppû [noun and verb], surāru, surruru, 
šemû, šuʾillakku, tarsītu, tēmēqu, tēnīnu, teslītu, tespītu, unnīnu, utnēnu, and upna petû) showed that 
when such was directed to non-humans—kings could also hear supplications—the non-humans 
were always benevolent powers (such as deities), never malevolent ones (such as demons). The 
distinction  is  rather  clearly  made  in  one  text  that  describes  the  utukku-demon  as  ša  teslītu  lā 
imaḫḫaru, “who  does not accept prayer”  (see CAD T, 370 [bilingual  section], citing  CT 17 36, 
K.9272:14 and duplicates). We should, however, probably not expect perfect consistency as the 
following illustrates. There are some instances in which Lamashtu, commonly believed to be a 
demon, “accepts a prayer” (unnīna leqû, see CAD L, 136 for references). Despite her malevolency, 
Lamashtu was considered to be a deity, the daughter of Anu, in ancient Mesopotamia (see Black 
and  Green,  115–16).  Despite  this  borderline  case,  it  seems  that  the  Mesopotamians  generally 
made a distinction between gods and demons when they used “prayer” words.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

“by order of [some deity],” and DN šipta iddi/iqbi, “[some deity] cast/spoke the 
incantation.”49 These legitimation formulae were intended to raise the authority 
of the ritual speech to the level of divine decree and thereby coerce the address-
ee to obey. As this volume shows, most incantation-prayers conclude with either 
a petition or thanksgiving  for the benevolent power’s favorable response. Only 
very  rarely  does  one  see  the  legitimation  formulae  in  incantation-prayers.  For 
example, there are only four instances of šiptu ul yuttun attached to an incanta-
tion-prayer, which makes these four quite exceptional among this very populous 
category of texts.50 See, likewise, Maqlû I 36 (see page 164), in which the suppli-
cant uses the ina qibīt formula to assert the accomplished defeat of the malevo-
lent witch.51 These exceptions are reminders that cultural data rarely fit neatly 
into compartmentalized categories. However, the fact that they are exceptional 
examples bolsters the usefulness of the analytical generalization presented here. 
From  the  above  observations,  it  may  be  concluded  that  some  ritual  texts 
modern  scholars  call  incantations  were  generally  construed  as  divine  speech 
while  those  identified  as  incantation-prayers  generally  reflect  that  of  human 
speech.52 Even though this generalization is still simplistic,53 it suggests there is 
heuristic  value  to  maintaining  our  modern  category  of  prayer  as  a  subset  of 
Mesopotamian ritual speech (see fig. 2).  

One final question concludes this discussion of refining a definition of pray-
er  and  praise  to  fit  the  Akkadian  material,  namely,  how  do  the  communal  and 
institutional aspects of religious activity come to bear upon our understanding of Ak-
kadian prayer and praise? 

As  for  the  communal  side  of  the  issue,  we  do  not  know  as  much  as  we 
would like about the actual Sitz im Leben of many prayers (see the descriptions 
below).  Based  on  the  content  of  the  ritual  instructions  that  often  follow  the 
wording of many prayers, however, the supplicant and the ritual expert seem to 
have been the only people involved, at least usually, in the actual performance of  

 
 

 
49  Sometimes this formula is expanded with –ma anāku ušanni/ašši, “and I repeated/bore (it).”

line 35, which, if accepted, would substantially change the meaning of the ina qibīt formula in 
line 36.

a ritual-prayer (i.e., reciting the text and performing the ritual actions that ac-
companied it).54 Aside from certain kinds of royal prayers that may have in-
cluded a public element to them, ancient Akkadian prayers were not spoken in a 
congregational setting; rather, they were individual. Despite the limited number 
of  people  involved,  such  ritual-prayers  were  not  necessarily  private  since  they 
may have been performed on a roof or beside a canal, although sometimes an 
inaccessible place was prescribed. In any case, although ritual-prayers were in-
tended for individuals, they were hardly individualistic. 

Who was present at or had access to the location of the ritual-prayer’s en-
actment is probably the least important element of the communal aspect of Mes-
opotamian prayer.  The  broader  social embeddedness  of  the  individual  and  the 
manner in which this shaped their identity occupy a much more important role 
in  the  proper  understanding  of  ancient  Akkadian  prayers.  The  Mesopotamians 
seem  to  have  created  personal  identity  primarily  via  their  family,  social  posi-
tion/occupation,  and  city,  among  other  things.55  Even  when  praying  alone  (or 
only  with  the  ritual  expert),  these  communal  aspects  of  life  were  ever-present 
concerns and therefore unsurprisingly impacted the kinds of petitions we find in 
the prayers. For example, the ubiquitous petition for life (balāṭu) included more 
than  biological  health  or  longevity;  “life”  encompassed  the  entire  social  and 
physical well-being of the person, as is clear from the poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi. In 
this doxological text the protagonist of the poem recounts how Marduk’s anger 
resulted  in  his  social  alienation  (I  41–104)  and  physical  suffering  (II  49–120). 
When Marduk sent healing, the physical ailments were dispelled (III 68–line m) 
and the sufferer  was reintegrated into his community in  a very public manner 

 
54  In the case of prayers of the diviner, the supplicant and ritual expert were one and the same. 
And in the cases of letter-prayers and royal prayers in building inscriptions, there are no ritual 
experts involved.  The  generalizations  in  this  paragraph  will  need  adjustment  according  to  the 
specific kind of prayer one is reading.

(IV  38ff.).  In  fact,  people  marveled  at  his  renewed  well-being  and  praised  the 
gods for it (IV 70–82). Although there is much more one might say here, this one 
examples  illustrates  the  importance  in  becoming  familiar  with  and  keeping  in 
mind the broader communal and social contexts as one interprets ancient pray-
ers. 

As for the institutional perspective, all of the texts that have come down to 
us  were  preserved  in  writing  by  a  group  of  elite,  literate  members  of  ancient 
Mesopotamian society, the scribes. Most of the documents that the above defini-
tion of religion would identify as religious are not simple, workaday scribal texts 
such  as  letters,  account  summaries,  or  receipts.  Rather,  they  are  complicated 
texts  that  demonstrate  linguistic  sophistication,  contain  theological  erudition, 
and would have required ritual expertise for their proper execution (such as the 
performance  of  an  extispicy,  the  making  of  figurines,  the  setting  up  of  altars, 
etc.). The scribes/ritual experts that composed and used these texts were likely 
therefore  not  normal  scribes  but  masters  of  the  scribal  craft  (Akk.  ummânū), 
well-educated in the traditional cuneiform curricula. Most of them would have 
worked  for  one  or  both  of the  great  institutions  of  their  day:  the  royal palace 
and the temples. It follows that the composition and preservation of much of the 
material  treated  in  this  volume  was  due  to  the  patronage/support  of  the  king 
and/or the temples. Furthermore,  judging from the content of the  prayers and 
hymns, their most  common  kinds  of  findspots  (e.g., palaces  and  temples),  and 
clues from texts such as royal letters, the king was the most important, though 
certainly not the exclusive, user/beneficiary of these prayers and hymns. 

The  three  most  important  institutional  groups  of  scholars/ritual  experts 
with regard to the Akkadian prayers and hymns in this volume are the diviners 
(bārû),  the  exorcists  (āšipū),  and  the  cult-singers  (kalû).  Although  they  were 
working in earlier times (see, e.g., the two OB prayers of the diviner in this vol-
ume), our best evidence for these three professions comes from first millennium 
tablets. From such texts we learn that these men—they were all men to the best 
of  our  knowledge—served  the  king  and  temples  via  their  learned  corpora,  in-
cluding  many  prayers  that  they  believed  derived  from  the  gods  themselves.56 
Thus, from an institutional rather than formal textual perspective many  ritual-
prayers could also be considered divine speech because the gods had delivered 
them to the institutional experts, who in turn performed them for and with the 
supplicant—adapting  them  as  necessary.57  In  order  to  contextualize  specific 
 
56  See  Alan  Lenzi,  Secrecy  and  the  Gods:  Secret  Knowledge  in  Ancient  Mesopotamia  and  Biblical 
Israel (SAAS 19; Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2008). 
57  Understanding an ancient Mesopotamian prayer as both human (primarily) and divine speech 
is akin to a theological understanding of Christianity’s most well-known prayer. The Lord’s Pray-
er was attributed to Jesus, who is traditionally identified as divinity incarnate; was recorded by a 
biblical author in Scripture, which is traditionally believed to be divinely-inspired; and is prayed 
by contemporary Christians on their own behalf. For a similar issue in contemporary Maya ritu-
als, see William F. Hanks, “Exorcism and the Description of Participant Roles,” in Natural Histo-
ries of Discourse  (ed. Michael Silvertein  and Greg  Urban; Chicago: University of Chicago Press,

Having explored the definition of prayer presented in the first section of this 
introduction and modifying it in light of the Mesopotamian material in the sec-
ond,  this  third  section  turns  to  consider  the  various  classes  that  scholars  have 
recognized as examples of Mesopotamian prayer. Some of the classes discussed 
below  are  recognized  on  the  basis  of  ancient  scribal  labels  and  rubrics  (e.g., 
shuillas,  ikribus,  and  tamitus).  Other  classes  are  modern  conventions,  created 
because scholars recognized certain thematic and/or structural similarities in the 
texts  (e.g.,  incantation-prayers,  royal  prayers,  and  letter-prayers).  A  com-
prehensive treatment of every class of Mesopotamian prayer in Akkadian is not

“all ritual speech in Maya could be construed as a sort of semiquote, insofar as shamans claim to 
have learned its forms either from other shamans, from dreams, or in charismatic dialogues with 
the very sprits they invoke in the third person. Shamans are not merely relayers of divine speech, 
however, since they consciously change their prayer forms over time, in order to beautify them.” 
58  The caveat “when appropriate” is necessary because not all prayers are attributable to one of 
these three groups. 
59  One might also usefully consult W. Röllig “Literatur. Überblick über die akkadische Literatur,” 
RlA 7 (1987–1990), 48–66, especially 54–56.

possible in these pages. The following only introduces the main features of sev-
eral of the more important ones.60 

Incantation-prayers: 

Because it is the largest group of prayers preserved in Akkadian and the best 
represented  class  in  this  volume,  the  section  begins  with  a  lengthy  and  more 
technical  discussion  of  Akkadian  prayers  known  broadly  as  the  incantation-
prayer  and  considers  the  vexing  issue  of the  relationship  between the incanta-
tion-prayer and the shuillas, a very important member of the incantation-prayer 
group in the history of scholarship. After sorting through this issue and present-
ing a full discussion of shuillas, two other kinds of incantation-prayers are more 
briefly discussed, namely, the namburbi-prayers and the dingirshadibba-prayers.

60  So-called prayer names, that is, names of people that express petition, praise, or lament (e.g., 
Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur, “O Nabu, guard my firstborn,” Aššur-rabi, “Ashur is great!,” and Ātanaḫ-ilī, “I 
have  become  weary,  my  god!”),  are  not  treated  in  this  introduction  (see,  e.g.,  von  Soden,

Pluralismus in Israel und Babylon [Stuttgart: Calwer Verlag, 1978; repr., Atlanta: Society of Bibli-
cal Literature, 2005], 102–19). Although probably practiced in ancient Mesopotamia, this intro-
duction will also leave extemporaneous prayer out of consideration. See the brief comments by 
von Soden in “Gebet II,” §7. See also the observation by Richard I. Caplice (The Akkadian Nam-
burbi Texts: An Introduction [SANE 1/1; Los Angeles: Undena, 1974], 12) that some instructions 
for namburbi-rituals direct the supplicant to speak whatever is on their mind (expressed in Akk. 
as mala libbašu ṣabtu idabbub, “he may speak as much as is in his heart”; amāta ša libbīšu idabbub, 
“he  may  speak  the  matter  from  his  heart”;  or  maʾdāti  iṣâti  ina  libbīšu  idabbub,  “he  may  speak

Whether one studies Mesopotamian prayers primarily within their own cul-
tural  contexts  or  for  comparative  purposes,  one  will  likely  encounter  shuillas. 
The term shuilla is derived from a Sumerian rubric meaning “lifted hand(s)” that 
functioned  as  a  classifier  of  ritual-prayers.61  Subscriptions  to  copies  of  such 
prayers  may  include  a  shuilla-rubric,  and  both  ritual  instructions  and  descrip-
tions of ritual enactments may employ it to indicate the recitation of prayers of 
this class. Gestures of lifted hands taken to express prayer or greeting are com-
mon in Mesopotamian figural art, and such gestures are attested in terms besides 
those corresponding to this rubric.62 Texts identified by a  shuilla-rubric consti-
tute the best attested single category of Mesopotamian ritual-prayers. The term 
“shuilla” refers to such ritual-prayers and the term “shuilla-prayer” refers explic-
itly  to  the  texts  to  be  recited.  The  present  book  includes  eleven  of  them.  Yet, 
despite more than a century of modern scholarly investigation of texts bearing 
this  rubric,  several  fundamental  problems  bedevil  the  use  of  this  term  among 
scholars  and  therefore  require  detailed  attention.  This  introductory  treatment 
discusses each of the following, in turn:  

(1) While three major classes of shuillas have been identified, scholars do not always 
specify the one to which they are referring. This section offers a brief overview of the 
evidence for these classes.  
(2) Concerning the best attested of these classes, the Akkadian shuillas of the āšipu, 
“exorcist,”  a  fundamental  disagreement  has  arisen  about  whether  the  term  shuilla 
should be applied to texts not actually bearing this rubric but considered similar to 
them. Because of this, it is often not apparent to what group of texts a given author 
intends the term to refer. This section offers a summary of arguments on both sides of 
the issue.  
(3) Also concerning this best-attested class of shuilla, scholars disagree as to its pur-

 
61  This rubric, šu.íl.la(2), combines the Sum. terms šu, “hand,” íl, “to lift,” and the nominalizing 
element –a. 
62  Various combinations of šu and íl (in some cases mu) and their corresponding Akkadian terms 
qāta, “hand,” našû, “to lift,” and šuʾillakku, “lifted hands,” express a gesture of greeting/prayer 
predicated of humans toward deities. Other idioms for such a gesture may be addressed to hu-
mans as well as to deities, e.g., ultu imittu karābu, “to greet with the right (hand),” and qāta elû, 
“to raise the hand.”

pose and its defining characteristics. This section provides a detailed review of several 
key issues and proposals. 

(1) Three Classes of Shuillas: Three major classes of shuillas have been differ-
entiated based on the language in which the prayers are written and the ritual 
expert associated with them. For each of these, some purpose and literary struc-
ture  has  been  proposed.  Yet,  neither  all  occurrences  of  the  rubric  nor  every 
prayer labeled with it can be clearly associated with one of these classes or its 
proposed purpose and structure.63 Almost all shuillas have been associated with 
one of two types of ritual expert, the kalû, “cult-singer,” or the āšipu, “exorcist.” 
In Mesopotamian culture, in which adverse events were perceived as the result 
of divine or demonic activity, the cult-singer was responsible for appeasing the 
hearts of the angry gods by means of chanting lamentations and performing rites 
of intercession;  the exorcist was responsible for rituals offering prevention and 
healing of illness, both spiritual and physical, as well as for effecting reconcilia-
tion between individuals and their personal deities, in effect preventing the pun-
ishments sent by the gods from taking full effect.64   

All known shuillas belonging to the craft of the cult-singer are in the Emesal 
dialect of Sumerian.65 These prayers probably originated in the public cult and 
were performed, always one prayer to one deity, in the frame of an annual festi-
val, presumably at the end of a procession involving the statue of the deity ad-
dressed. They were recited in the first place to greet the deity. One type of them 
was  intended  to  calm  the  addressee,  who  immediately  upon  returning  from  a 
cultic event interpreted as a battle, was caught up in a hostile mood. 

In  the  craft  of  the  exorcist,  there  are  two  major  classes  of  shuillas  distin-
guished,  inter  alia,  by  their language  of  composition,  Akkadian  or  Sumerian.66

divine  images.67  This  ritual  spanned  two  days,  and  these  five  prayers  were  all 
recited at the high point of the ritual.68 Four of these prayers are preserved; they 
range  from  nineteen  to  forty-seven  lines  in  length,  and  their  content  concerns 
the activity of the ritual.69 It is widely recognized  that shuillas in monolingual 
Akkadian were employed in  a variety of ritual  contexts and in many cases ex-
plicitly request one of the “high gods” to intercede with the speaker’s angry per-
sonal  gods.  Yet,  proposals  for  a  fuller  grasp  of  the  Akkadian  shuillas’  purpose 
and  defining  characteristics  remain  under  discussion  and  are  treated  in  more 
detail below.  

(2) Incantation-prayer = or ≠ Shuilla? The best attested class of shuillas are 
those written in Akkadian and belonging to the craft of the exorcist.70 All of the 
shuillas in the present volume fall into this category and are referred to simply 
as “Akkadian shuilla-prayers.” They have been classified along with other Akka-
dian ritual-prayers of the exorcist that bear not the shuilla-rubric but other clas-
sifying rubrics on the basis of the following shared basic literary structure.71 

1. Address (including invocation and praise),  
2. Petition (including lament), and  
3. Thanksgiving/blessing.  

The resulting genre is conventionally known as Gebetsbeschwörung, “incantation-
prayer.”72  Assyriologists, however, do not agree on the application of the term 
shuilla within this broad category, and this discrepancy of usage adds confusion

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

to scholarship concerning this rubric, which is already complex. Two influential 
studies have differentiated sub-genres of this broad class proceeding from a fun-
damental distinction among rubrics: the term shuilla, “lifted hand(s),” which has 
long been recognized as indicating a gesture of prayer or greeting (King, BMS, 
xix-xx), and other rubrics recognized as indicating specific purposes, for exam-
ple, the dissolution of an evil omen or of a spell. Since the classification systems 
of  both  of  these  studies  remain  in  use  among  scholars,  both  are  summarized 
briefly here. 

Kunstmann’s study from the 1930s made the term shuilla synonymous with 
incantation-prayer (see BGB). Two factors apparently contributed to this usage: 
the  idiomatic  meaning  of  the  shuilla-rubric  was  taken  as  synonymous  with 
“prayer” in a general sense, and yet this rubric appeared on prayers regarded as 
belonging to  different  sub-genres  of  incantation-prayer.  The  term  “incantation-
prayer”  grew  out  of  a  clear  distinction  between  prayer  and  magic:  these  texts 
were seen as incantations in that they accomplished their goal, in part, magical-
ly  by  the  recitation  of  powerful  speech  and  the  carrying  out  of  actions,  both 
speech and act being believed effective in themselves; they were seen as prayers 
in  that  they  addressed  petitions  to  one  or  more  gods  (Kunstmann,  BGB,  3–4). 
Each incantation-prayer was placed into one of three categories: “general,” “spe-
cial,” or “in-between” on the basis of two criteria: (1) purpose, either general or 
specific; and (2) emphasis, either on its magical actions or  on the prayer itself 
and its offering. Most of those bearing the shuilla-rubric were considered “gen-
eral  shuillas”  chiefly  because  they  lacked  indicators  of  specific  purpose.  These 
also tended to include little ritual activity besides an offering. “Special shuillas” 
clearly specified a purpose and were often accompanied by more complex ritual 
actions. Those bearing the shuilla-rubric and including a further specification of 
occasion or purpose were in most cases classified as “in-between” (Kunstmann, 
BGB, 70–72).73  

Mayer  in  the  1970s  advocated  that  in  order  to  respect  its  native  usage 
among incantation-prayers, the term shuilla should be employed exclusively to 
refer  to  those  prayers  which  are  actually  attested  with  the  rubric  or  to  those 
which arguably would have born it (Mayer, UFBG, 7–8, 377). The present vol-
ume  espouses  this position.  Other  scholars,  however,  continue  to  use the  term 
shuilla to refer to the broader category. Avoiding the dichotomy between magic 
and ritual, this later study defined incantation-prayers as ritual petition-prayers 
of the individual, explaining that they are: (1) oriented to a ritual unit; (2) com-
prised  of  mostly  pre-formulated  petitionary  speech  of  an  especially  powerful 
type;  and  (3)  combined  with other  specified  ritual  actions over  all  of  which  a 

 
73  Kunstmann placed only two prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric in the “special” category, one 
on the basis of a clearly specified purpose added to the rubric, and the other on the basis that it 
had several characteristics of incantations for activating materials for ritual use (BGB, 5, 80–82). 
The latter, Nisaba 1, is included in the present volume at page 351.

ritual  expert  presided  on  behalf  of  an  individual  (Mayer,  UFBG,  10–12,  22).74 
This  study  identified  in  these  ritual-prayers  a  two-part  core,  an  address  with 
names and a petition, and around this core it described the following structure, 
the sequence of which may vary (adapted from Mayer, UFBG, 36–37): 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 

• 
• 

By  expressing  the  deity’s  greatness,  power  and  goodness,  those  praying  can 
make these qualities ritually present (vergegenwärtigen). 
The petition may be developed in multiple respects or can be embedded in the 
context of a motivating clause. If the petition is motivated by distress, it can be 
expressed in the form of a “lament” and thereby appeal to the mercy of the god. 
Petitioners may articulate before the god what they do in carrying out the pray-
er  and  ritual:  namely  that  they  turn  to  the  god  pleading,  or  that  they  have 
brought certain “advance payment” in the form of sacrifices and gifts. 
The petition referring to a specific concern may be preceded by a petition for the 
merciful attention of the deity, and it may be extended by a petition for other 
concerns. 
An “offer to perform,” i.e., the promise to praise the divinity for that god’s help 
or the wish that others do so, may follow the petition and serve also to help mo-
tivate the divinity. 
Those  praying may introduce themselves by name and suitable epithets in  the 
parts of the prayer which refer to themselves.  
The expert responsible for the sequence of the petition ritual may intervene in 
the prayers of petitioners or speak for the petitioners’ concerns. 

Of  all  incantation-prayers  the  best  attested  are  namburbis  and  Akkadian 
shuillas, treated in detail below. Others served various purposes, including free-
ing a person from malignant powers or events such as sickness, demons, witch-
craft, and bad dreams.75 One ought to recognize the apparent creativity and flu-

 
74  Given the continued disagreement on this issue, it is confusing when  scholars offer Mayer’s 
definition  of  an  incantation-prayer  in  order  to  explain  what  a  shuilla  is.  See,  e.g.,  Sally  A.  L. 
Butler,  Mesopotamian  Conceptions  of  Dreams  and  Dream  Rituals  (AOAT  258;  Münster:  Ugarit-
Verlag, 1998), 130. 
75  Mayer  distinguished  three  major  sub-types  of  incantation-prayers:  shuillas,  namburbis  and 
prayers serving to free a person from malignant powers; beyond these he identified an array of 
smaller groups, though he stressed that these should not be taken as an exhaustive listing (UFBG, 
13–18). The smaller groups concern the dissolution of unclear or bad dreams, the fending off of 
field pests, shigu-prayers (petitions for absolution from sin), and blessings for houses and build-
ings. Mayer did not include dingirshadibba-prayers, which are treated below, in his study, point-
ing out that they do not seem to have a unified literary form (ibid., 16–17). One class of texts for 
which Mayer creates a separate listing in UFBG (432–35) but which he does not discuss as a sub-
genre of incantation-prayer in the introduction to that study are Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Assyri-
ologists coined this classifier to designate incantations addressed to materials used in rituals and 
intended to activate, enhance, and elicit the qualities of the materials (Kunstmann, BGB, 80; I. 
Tzvi  Abusch,  “Blessing  and  Praise  in  Ancient  Mesopotamian  Incantations,”  in  Literatur,  Politik 
und Recht in Mesopotamien: Festschrift für Claus Wilcke (ed. W. Sallaberger, K. Volk, and A. Zgoll; 
Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003], 1–14, here 2). Under Mayer’s definition of the core of incanta-
tion-prayers—address  of  a  deity  with  petitions—such  texts  could  be  considered  incantation-
prayers if they include both of these elements and to the extent that the materials addressed are

idity with which purposes could be constructed and combined. For instance, one 
namburbi is for dissolving “evil that can cling to someone because of the magi-
cal manipulations of witches” and so associates the general purpose of nambur-
bis, to dissolve evil fate, with defense against the malignant power of witchcraft 
(see Maul, ZB, 445).76 Moreover, Akkadian shuillas were in many cases carried 
out in conjunction with  namburbis (see Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, 
§6).  Aside  from  namburbis,  dingirshadibbas,  and  Akkadian  shuillas,  all  other 
incantation-prayers are referred to simply as such in the present volume. 

(3) Akkadian Shuillas: Even if one accepts the position that the shuilla-rubric 
marks a particular class of ritual petition-prayers of the individual, as does the 
present volume, one must recognize a range of scholarly opinion regarding the 
distinguishing characteristics and purpose of Akkadian shuillas. The present dis-
cussion clusters around the interpretation of four aspects of these ritual-prayers: 
the shuilla-rubric; typical and distinctive characteristics of the prayers; essential 
elements of the ritual activity associated with them; and the rationale and pur-
pose of these ritual-prayers as a whole. 
 
Recognizing that the term “shuilla” refers to a gesture of greeting or prayer, 
most translators either render it literally as “lifted-hand” or translate it “prayer” 
or “petition-prayer.”77 As already noted, by contrast to other rubrics that convey 
more specific purposes, the prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric tend not to be as-
signed  to  a  ritual  having  a  specific  purpose  (Kunstmann,  BGB).  In  fact,  one 
scholar has taken this rubric to mark a non-category of ritual-prayers, those hav-
ing no specific purpose.78 Interpreted as “prayer” or “petition-prayer,” one could 
imagine  the  shuilla-rubric  applying  to  the  entire  genre  of  incantation-prayer. 
However,  the  linguistic  features  of  Akkadian  shuilla-prayers  demonstrate  a 

 
seen  to  represent  recognized  deities  or  personified  objects.  See  the  incantation-prayer  to  Salt, 
page 189 in this volume. 
76  On the blending of ritual function in the Akkadian shuilla Nisaba 1, see pages 350–52 in this 
book. 
77  In  translating  the  rubric  as  “petition-prayer,”  Mayer  follows  Franz  Kraus  (UFBG,  7).  Zgoll 
prefers the literal translation (Annette Zgoll, Die Kunst des Betens:  Form und Funktion, Theologie 
und  Psychagogik  in  babylonisch-assyrischen  Handerhebungsgebeten  zu  Ištar  [AOAT  308;  Münster: 
Ugarit-Verlag,  2003,  passim]).  While  stressing  that  the  rubric  marks  prayers  with  distinctive 
characteristics and not just any prayer at all, Zgoll views the shuilla-rubric as supplying an over-
arching  category  “prayer”  when  combined  with  other  rubrics  (Die  Kunst  des  Betens,  21–22). 
However,  she  has  not  taken  up  the  issue  of  the  distinctiveness  of  shuillas  as  a  class  in  detail. 
Frechette rejects interpretation of this rubric as synonymous with “prayer.” See his “Reconsider-
ing ŠU.IL2.LA(2) as a Classifier of the Āšipu in Light of the Iconography of Reciprocal Hand-Lifting 
Gestures,”  in  Proceedings  of  the  51st  Rencontre  Assyriologique  Internationale  Held  at  the  Oriental 
Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005, (ed. R. Biggs, J. Myers, and M. Roth; SAOC 
62;  Chicago:  Oriental  Institute  of  the  University  of  Chicago,  2008),  39–46;  and  Mesopotamian 
Ritual-prayers, §2.

number  of  distinctive  tendencies  as  compared  with  the  other  incantation-
prayers, including the following:79

• 

They employ elevated speech befitting the formality of an audience.  
They include petitions to reconcile client and personal gods.  
They include petitions for health  and well-being stated in general  terms while 
being adaptable to specific occasions.80 

The basic structure of and rationale for Akkadian shuillas manifest the concept 
of an “audience,” a fundamental situation of ancient Near Eastern culture con-
cerning ceremonies for a meeting in which someone presents a request to some-
one  of  a  higher  social  status.81  Noting  that  other  Mesopotamian  ritual-prayers 
also reflect such a rationale, one scholar argues that the shuilla-rubric itself of-
fers a key to the distinctive rationale for these ritual-prayers. Preferring a literal 
translation of the shuilla-rubric, he interprets its idiomatic meaning as concrete-
ly grounded in a formal gesture of greeting appropriate when entering the court 
of  a  god  or  king  and  analogous  to  a  military  salute  in  that  it  demonstrates 
recognition of an asymmetrical relationship between the subordinate who offers 
the gesture and the one of higher status who receives it and who may have been 
understood to  offer  a  reciprocal  gesture  of  some  kind.82  The  following  schema 
for Akkadian shuillas is followed by a detailed discussion of each section:83  
 
 
79  These  findings  of  Mayer  are  not  summarized  in  UFBG,  but  they  are  discussed  by  Frechette 
(Mesopotamian  Ritual-prayers,  §4).  Mayer  provisionally  characterized  shuilla-prayers  as  con-
cerned in a general way with a good human condition, liberation from what is life-threatening, 
and  attainment  of  what  supports  life  (UFBG,  13).  Such  characterization,  however,  assumes  a 
form-critical stance that is overly confident in the capacity of a type of text considered original 
to  disclose  the  function  of  a  genre.  In  thus  characterizing  shuilla-prayers,  he  discounted  the 
many cases in which rather specific petitions have been added to a given exemplar. 
80  Noting that many particular exemplars of the canonical form of a given prayer are adapted for 
specific  occasions,  Frechette  considers  such  adaptability  a  defining  characteristic  of  shuillas 
(Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §§4, 6, 7).

Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2008), 53–58.  
82  See Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §2. He acknowledges there that notions of prayer, 
blessing,  and  greeting  are  closely  related  in  Mesopotamian  culture,  as  can  be  seen in that the 
same  term  (karābu)  can  express  all  three.  On  this  point,  see  the  landmark  article  by  Benno 
Landsberger, “Das ‘gute Wort,’” in Altorientalische Studien: Bruno Meissner zum sechzigsten Geburts-
tag am 25. April 1928 (Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1928–1929), 294–321.

• 

Setting: 

 
• 

• 

o  They are addressed to a single high-ranking deity (rarely to multiple deities 

as a collective). 

o  While  they  could  be  performed  as  units  in  isolation,  they  were  certainly 
performed in immediate conjunction with other ritual procedures in many 
cases.  

o  They usually take place outdoors at night or in early morning in order to 

address the deities in their astral aspects. 

Essential Elements (to which others may be added): 

o  Purification of the place (often by sweeping and sprinkling with water) 
o  Offerings,  which usually  include the burning of  aromatics and pouring  of 

libations and may include food offerings 

o  Hand-lifting gesture(s) and prostration or kneeling of the client 
o  Triple recitation of the specified text to the deity, which typically empha-

sizes an eloquent address 

Rationale and Purpose:  

o  The  rationale  of  reciprocity  operative  in  an  audience  determined  that  by 
accepting the offerings, gestures, and speech of the subject, the superior be-
ing addressed was to some degree obliged to respond favorably to the re-
quest for assistance. Through this ritual, one sought to (re-)establish such a 
reciprocal relationship with the deity, but the deity was regarded as free to 
accept or to refuse. 

o  The shuilla-rubric names the entire ritual by highlighting as its central ac-
tion the hand-lifting gesture, which in a condensed and apt way signals to 
the deity simultaneously the client’s submission and expectation of favora-
ble recognition and response to petition. 

Prior to discussing the specific points of this schema, it should be noted that 
all ritual instructions preserved in connection  with prayers should be regarded 
as  aids  to memory rather  than  comprehensive  or  exact  indicators  of  what was 
enacted. For instance, it has been observed that some ritual actions were consid-
ered  so  obvious  that  they  were  taken  for  granted  and  not  specified  in  written 
instructions.84 Where multiple copies of a specific ritual of the exorcist are pre-
served,  we  may  observe  disparity  among  them  in  the  amount  of  detail  with 
which ritual instructions are given as well as differences in the elements or order 
of elements included.85 Such differences may result in some cases from the varie-
ty of purposes for which a given tablet may have been copied, for example, for 
 
84  Stefan  Maul  notes  that  while  Kultmittelbeschwörungen  incantations  intended  to  activate  the 
effectiveness of various materials used in rituals, e.g., water and flour, are well attested in other 
rituals, they are with one exception not attested in any instructions for namburbi-rituals (ZB, 33, 
n.67). He explains this omission by suggesting that such incantations were so self-evident to the 
expert that they did not need to be written (ibid., 33). 
85  Maul  has  shown  that  different  copies  of  the  same  ritual  might  provide  details  in  different 
degree, from a more elaborate “handbook” style, perhaps intended to instruct the beginner, to a 
much more laconic style which regarded a greater number of actions as self-evident (ibid., 96–
97).

archival purposes, for enactment on a specific occasion, or within a certain ritual 
context, as an amulet or votive, or as a demonstration by an apprentice that he 
had mastered a given text.86 Among those copies of shuilla-prayers containing no 
ritual instructions at all, some bear colophons indicating that they were copied 
for a specific ritual series. For instance, instructions citing the prayers by incipit 
occur  on  the  ritual-tablets  of  Bīt  salāʾ  mê,  a  ritual  lasting  several  days  for  the 
purification  of  the  king  that took  place  during  the  fall  Babylonian  New  Year’s 
festival.87  

Concerning  the  setting:  Akkadian  shuilla-prayers  are  directed  primarily  to 
“high  gods”  (as  opposed  to  “personal  gods”).88  While  many  shuilla-prayers  in-
clude petitions for healing, they have been characterized as concerned to obtain 
help in reconciling personal gods to the speaker.89 Comparative analysis demon-
strates that petitions for intercession regarding such reconciliation occur with a 
significantly  higher  frequency  in  shuilla-prayers  than  in  other  incantation-
prayers.90 In the Bīt salāʾ mê ritual for the legitimation of the Babylonian king, 
the sequence of shuilla-rituals is intended to gain the intercession of the many 
high-ranking gods  addressed with the  king’s  angry personal  deities  in  order  to 
reconcile them with him.91 

All three major classes of shuillas are addressed to deities as individuals.92  
Considerable  evidence  demonstrates  inclusion  of  Akkadian  shuillas  along-
side  or  within  other  rituals.93  For  instance,  they  were  likely  enacted  routinely 
with namburbis, and lengthy sequences of them are attested in elaborate royal 
rituals such as Bīt salāʾ mê and Bīt rimki.  

Concerning the essential elements: This organization of elements for Akkadian 
shuillas is not  restrictive, and much of it is  not distinctive. The notion  of peti-
tioning  deities  in  the  context  of  an  audience  with  its  necessary  purificatory 
preparations, offerings, gestures, and recitations may be observed in other Mes-
 
86  See ibid., 159–90 and Ishtar 2 on page 257.

88  Zgoll describes these prayers as addressed especially to gods responsible for illness. However, 
a number of the gods she cites in support of this point are addressed not in any known shuilla-
prayers  but  in  other  incantation-prayers  (Die  Kunst,  22,  n.52  citing  Nils  Heeßel,  Babylonisch-

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

opotamian  rituals,  especially  those  designated  as  “meal  or  aromatic  gift  offer-
ings.”94  Some  Akkadian  shuillas  include  elements  not  listed  here,  such  as  the 
manipulation of materials (bricks, minerals, fabric) or the making of other ges-
tures (holding of objects, anointing of the client).95  

In only two extant exemplars (Nusku 7 and Ishtar 1) is it fairly clear that an 
instruction  specifies  that  a  shuilla-prayer  be recited  in  conjunction  with  a ges-
ture  of  hand-lifting.  Nevertheless,  in  light  of  the  rubric  and  of  the  practice  of 
scribes  to  dispense  with  noting  obvious  elements,  it  is  likely  that  a  gesture  of 
hand-lifting was assumed.96  

The instruction for a triple recitation of the text occurs in many cases and 
was likely presumed. In the texts of the prayers, typically the address of the dei-
ty occupies a large portion of the total prayer and is expressed with heightened 
rhetorical style.97  

Concerning  the  rationale  and  purpose:  By  means  of  this  ritual-prayer  one 
sought  to  establish  a  reciprocal  relationship  with  the  deity  addressed  as  was 
typical of asymmetrical relationships in the ancient Near East; in such relation-
ships the one receiving the gifts, gestures, and prayers would be to some degree 
obliged  to  respond  favorably  to  the  petitioner.98  While  the  convention  of  reci-
procity certainly influenced perceptions of shuilla-rituals as effective for present-
ing petitions, the efficacy of Mesopotamian rituals derived primarily from their 
perceived divine origin, and a favorable response to petitions included in them 
could not be presumed.99  
 
94  See  Werner  Mayer  and  Walther  Sallaberger,  “Opfer.  A.I.  Nach  schriftlicher  Quellen:  Meso-
potamien,”  RlA  10  (2003–2005),  93–102,  §7.2.  Of the types  of  prayer  included  in the present 
volume, this listing includes namburbis. 
95  Zgoll’s  discussion  lists  the  burning  of  aromatics  as  an  essential  element  separate  from  the 
offering of libations and possibly foods (“Für Sinne,” 29–30). However, one well-attested, laconic 
formula simply instructs either the setting up of a ritual arrangement (riksu) or a censer (nignak-
ku). Such an  option is attested at least once in  exemplars of fourteen different shuilla-prayers. 
Since riksu here likely refers to an array of ritual paraphernalia including the censer, this formula 
leaves  open  the  possibility that in some  cases  only  incense  was  offered.  For  discussion  of  this 
instruction, see Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §5. 
96  For a detailed  discussion of the significance of  the rubric and its  implications for the ritual 
activity accompanying these shuilla-prayers, see ibid., §§2, 3, 5. The gesture of lifted hand(s) is 
mentioned  in  neither  Zgoll’s  discussion  of  the  function  of  the  procedures  and  words  in  these 
rituals (“Für Sinne,” 27–43) nor in her sketch of the structure and elements of these rituals (“Au-
dienz,”  183–87).  However,  her  comparison  of  the  elements  of  shuilla-rituals  with  those  of  an 
audience with a human ruler as portrayed in The Poor Man of Nippur asserts that such a gesture 
was enacted and gave the ritual its name (“Audienz,” 189–97).

prayers, §§3, 7. 
99  Claus Ambos offers the following summary of the operative worldview: 

Mesopotamian techniques of ritual and divination were believed to have been trans-
mitted to man by the gods themselves, and they could never work against the will of 
the gods nor  force them to  perform an  action merely  because it was desired by the 
ritual’s human participants. The reason is that ritual was not effective in itself but de-

The shuilla-rubric names the ritual by highlighting the hand-lifting gesture 
as a  central  action, one likely presumed  by  the exorcists, and the rationale for 
highlighting  this  gesture  may  be  summarized  as  follows:100  A  gesture  of  lifted 
hands  expressed  by  terms  corresponding  to  the  shuilla-rubric  is  instructed  for 
various rituals, but for  this  one  it was of  central significance. That an element 
occurring in various rituals could be the classifying rubric of a particular ritual 
for which it held such significance is otherwise attested.101 While offerings and 
speech  were  essential  to  an  audience,  Akkadian  shuillas  emphasized  the  com-
municative  gesture  to  which  the  shuilla-rubric  refers,  a  salutation  signaling 
recognition  of  a  reciprocal  but  asymmetrical  relationship  between  client  and 
deity.102  Given  the  lexical  and  visual  evidence  that  such  greetings  were  ex-
changed in a reciprocal manner, this gesture would have provided a particularly 
apt ritual focus for expressing both the desire to (re-)establish such a relationship 
with the deity and the anticipation of the deity’s acceptance of this relationship 
and favorable response to the petitions presented. As already noted, the propor-
tion of text dedicated to formal address of the deity typically occupies up to half 
of  the  text  of  the  prayer.  These  shuilla-prayers  did  convey  petitions  and  were 
often  recited  in  conjunction  with  other  prayers  expressing  petitions,  but  their 
ritual  designation  highlighted  this  formal  gesture  of  greeting.  In  so  doing,  the 
ritual focused on an action  which in a condensed and apt way  signaled to the 
deity simultaneously the client’s willing submission and expectation of favorable 
recognition  and  help.  In  this  way,  the  petitions  associated  with  these  shuillas 
were  explicitly  contextualized  by  this  gesture  which  affirmed  an  asymmetrical 
yet reciprocal relationship between petitioner and deity.  

Additional specifications of purpose  within either rubrics or ritual instruc-
tions,  while  rare,  are  attested  among  exemplars  of  Akkadian  shuilla-prayers. 
These may be seen as explicit statements of context within which the assistance 
of the deity addressed was sought.103 

 

pended upon the gods’ collaboration. This concept could also account for occasional 
ritual  failure:  the  gods  simply  were  refusing  any  communication  with  the  human 
sphere and were not inclined to accept a prayer or a ritual. 

(“Ritual  Healing  and  the  Investiture of the  Babylonian  King,” in The Problem  of  Ritual  Efficacy 
[ed. W. Sax, J. Quack, J. Weinhold; New York: Oxford University Press, 2010], 17–44, here 17). 
100  This explanation of this rationale follows Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §§ 3, 7. 
101  A  particular  ritual  element,  even  one  commonly  attested  among  various  rituals,  was  em-
ployed  in  some  cases  to  name  a  particular  ritual  for  which  that  element  captured  the  central 
significance. Claus Ambos discusses how this is the case for the sprinkling rite central to the Bīt 
salāʾ  mê,  “house  of  sprinkling,”  ritual  as  well  as  for  the  “mouthwashing”  central  to  the  Mīs  pî 
ritual, “mouth-washing” (Der König, §II.3.2). See also Dick, “Pīt Pī,” 581–82). 
102  As noted above, these shuilla-rituals were addressed, like those of the other two recognized 
classes mentioned above, almost exclusively to individual high-ranking deities. 
103  See Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §3, 6.

Omens  were  important  indicators  of  the  will  of  the  gods  for  the  ancient 
Mesopotamians and could manifest themselves in anything that was a) deemed 
significant in their system of divination and b) observed by someone. Solicited 
omens were obtained through human actions intent on finding signs as, for ex-
ample,  in  the  case  of  liver  divination  (i.e.,  hepatoscopy,  sacrificing  an  animal 
and examining its liver to interpret the signs the gods had placed on it). Unsolic-
ited  omens  could  take  the  form  of  a  host  of  things  one  might  observe  in  the 
course of everyday life. Certain signs were deemed unfavorable and others were 
favorable. The description of signs and their significance was expressed in an “if-
then” statement and recorded on tablets. The “if” clause is technically called the 
protasis  by  scholars;  the  “then”  clause  is  called  the  apodosis.  In  the  course  of 
time, scribes compiled long lists of omens and arranged them thematically into 
tablet series such as Shumma Alu, dealing with terrestrial omens, Shumma Izbu, 
dealing  with  malformed  births,  and  Enuma  Anu  Enlil,  dealing  with  celestial 
omens.  It  was  believed  that  before  a  calamity  happened,  the  gods  might  an-
nounce it with an evil omen.105 The shape of a malformed animal fetus, the ap-
pearance of a lizard on the wall in one’s house, the movement of a planet, the 
content of a dream—these and many, many other things could be understood as 

 
104  Despite its size, Maul’s volume does not contain all known namburbi-rituals. He states that 
his interpretations  are  based  on  both  the  published  editions  and  on  about  two  hundred  other 
namburbi-ritual  fragments  known to  him  (ZB,  XII,  n.11).  Unfortunately,  he  does  not  list  these 
fragments systematically anywhere in the volume. 
105  Not  all  omens  were  evil,  however;  some  were  interpreted  as  favorable.  In  the  case  of  evil 
omens counteracted by namburbi-rituals, Maul suggests that the Mesopotamians understood the 
impending evil to have been the result of a human misdeed, committed by the one affected by 
the omen, that had angered the gods (see “How the Babylonians Protected Themselves,” 124 and 
ZB, 60).

unsolicited evil signs.106 According to Maul, these things are omen bearers; they 
bore the evil of the omen to the person affected.107 

Despite the announcement of coming calamity, the one affected by the evil 
omen did not have to resign themselves to its ravages. The execution of a nam-
burbi-ritual, performed by the exorcist for and with the person affected—often 
the king but others as well, would avert the impending ill announced by an evil 
omen  before  it  happened  and  thereby  return  the  affected  person  to  normal 
life.108  Attested  rituals  counteract  many  different  kinds  of  evil,  as  a  perusal  of 
Maul’s table of contents will show (see ZB, VI–VII). For example, there are ritu-
als  against  evil  omens  associated  with  the  behavior  or  specific  observations  of 
birds, snakes, dogs, lizards, ants, and other animals, against the observation of 
lightning, against the appearance of fungus in a house, against a specific time of 
a  child’s  birth,  against  a  lunar  eclipse,  and  against  chariot  accidents  while  on 
campaign, among others. The namburbi-ritual could be quite short or be carried 
out over several days. If one is to judge from the ritual accoutrement involved 
(e.g., precious metals, a host of food and drink offerings, and the fabrication of 
figurines),  some  of  the  namburbi-rituals  would  have  been  very  expensive  and 
taken days to prepare.109 Whatever its cost, without a ritual response to release 
or undo the evil portended by the omen, the evil that was announced, so it was 
thought, would become a reality. 

Namburbi-prayers  comprise  the  class  of  incantation-prayer  recited  during 
namburbi-rituals for the specific purpose, as the name suggests (the Sum. word 
nam-búr-bi means “its releasing”),110 of releasing the announced evil so it would 
not  actually  harm  the  person  affected  by  the  appearance  of  the  omen.111  Not 
 
106  There is  much,  much  more to  say  about  divination  in  ancient  Mesopotamia.  For  a  concise 
overview, see A. K. Grayson, “Divination,” in Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide, 373–76 and 
Jean Bottéro, Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods (trans. Zainab Bahrani and Marc van 
de  Mieroop;  Chicago:  University  of  Chicago  Press,  1992),  125–37.  A  much  fuller  treatment  is 
presented in Stefan Maul, “Omina und Orakel. A. Mesopotamien,” RlA 10 (2003–2005), 45–88. It 
should  be  noted  that  the  omen  collections  were  not  merely  observation-based  collections.  Ra-
ther,  they  underwent  scholastic  development  and  therefore  often  contain  signs  that  would  be 
highly  unlikely  or  impossible to  ever  observe  (e.g.,  a  seven-headed  izbu  or  a  lunar  eclipse  on, 
say, the fifth day of a lunar month). 
107  For a summary of Maul’s view of the “omen bearers,” see pages 357 and 407. 
108  That namburbi-rituals fell within the professional and institutional domain of the exorcist is 
clear from KAR 44, rev. 6 (and parallels), the so-called Vademecum of the Exorcist, where nam-
burbi-rituals are listed among the texts an exorcist must master. See M. J. Geller, “Incipits and 
Rubrics” in Wisdom, Gods, and Literature: Studies in Assyriology in Honour of W. G. Lambert (ed. A. 
R. George and I. L. Finkel; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 225–58 for the most recent edition. 
109  See Maul, ZB, 29–36 for a presentation of what can be gleaned about ritual preparations from 
the royal correspondence of Neo-assyrian scholars and 39–47 for his reconstruction of prepara-
tions from the ritual instructions. 
110  The  Sumerian  suffix  –bi,  “its,”  in  the  name  originally  referred  to  the  omen  apodosis,  the 
“then” part of the omen entry that asserted the significance of the observed sign (see Maul, ZB, 
12). 
111  Although  releasing  evil  was  the  usual  purpose  of  namburbi-rituals,  a  very  small  minority 
were intended for a positive purpose. For example, we have namburbi-rituals to bring about an

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

every namburbi-ritual required a namburbi-prayer, however,112 and other kinds 
of  prayers  may  also  have  been  required  during  the  course  of  the  ritual  (e.g., 
shuilla-prayers  and  cult-material  incantation-prayers  or  Kultmittelbeschwörung-
en).113  When  a  prayer  was  prescribed  by  the  ritual  instructions—namburbi  or 
otherwise, it might appear as a full text embedded in the broader ritual context. 
Sometimes, however, the instructions only cited the incipit, that is, the prayer’s 
initial line; the remainder of the prayer would have been provided by the exor-
cist performing the ritual, presumably from memory or from another tablet.  

A  namburbi-prayer  was  only  one  part  in  a  rather  complex  ritual  process, 
which is briefly summarized here in an idealized form.114 After the exorcist pre-
pared the items needed for the ritual (e.g., holy water and figurines) and erected 
an  altar,115  the  people  and  places116  involved  in  the  ritual  would  be  purified 
(e.g., the one affected by the omen may wash in water). An offering of various 
foods  and  drinks,  which in  fact  constituted  a meal, would be presented to the 
gods involved in the ritual, typically Shamash, Ea, and Asalluḫi.117 Incense may 
also be burned during the meal.118 With the preparations made for approaching 
the gods and the mood for a favorable hearing achieved, the heart of the ritual 
began: the removal of the impending evil from the one affected by the evil sign. 
It is at this point in the ritual that the prayer would have been recited. 

 
increase  in  trade  for  a  business  owner  or  other  professional  (see  Caplice,  Akkadian  Namburbi 
Texts, 9 and 23–24) and to overcome the estrangement of a couple who had been separated for a 
time (see ZB, 409–14). 
112  This point is easily verified by perusing the examples translated in Caplice, Akkadian Nam-
burbi Texts. As with all ritual instructions, however, the possibility must be considered that not 
everything that was to be done in a namburbi-ritual was actually written on the tablet. In some 
cases, the ritual instructions may have presumed the exorcist knew what (else) there was to do. 
113  For the incorporation of the shuilla-prayer, Sin 1, into a namburbi against the evil of a lunar 
eclipse,  see  page  386,  n.7  and  the  references  there.  For  cult-material  prayer-incantations,  as 
stated earlier, we must presume they were recited during namburbi-rituals from memory by the 
exorcist since they were not incorporated into the actual instructions (with one exception). See 
Maul’s statements in ZB, 33 with n.67, 107 with n.8, and 375, 377, line 12ʹh for the exception). 
114  This  summary  is  idealized  because  not  every  element  in  it  is  attested  in  every  namburbi-
ritual, and there is no attempt here at an exhaustive listing of the great variety in ritual details. 
For the variety of ritual actions, see Maul’s thorough treatment in ibid., 39–113 and the much 
briefer overview in Caplice, Akkadian Namburbi Texts, 9–12. 
115  See ZB, 39–47. 
116  The ritual could take place in a variety of settings such as the roof of a house, the bank of a 
canal, or where the omen manifested itself. But it is not uncommon for the instructions to de-
scribe  the  location  only  vaguely:  a  secluded  place  in  the  steppe  (ina  ṣēri  parsi)  or  some  other 
inaccessible locale (ašar šēpu parsat, lit. “a place where the foot is barred”; see ibid., 48). 
117  See ibid., 48–59. 
118  Caplice, remarking on the burning of aromatics, writes, “it is clear that burning them on a 
censer was part of the normal banquet situation among human beings in the Neo-Assyrian peri-
od,  so  that  their  use  in  rituals  providing  a  divine  banquet  was  natural”  (Akkadian  Namburbi 
Texts, 11). Note also the similarity to the meal-related activities as described in the OB ikribu-
like prayer, line 11ff. (see page 90). 

 

INTRODUCTION 

39

       Formally, namburbi-prayers follow the typical outline of other incantation-
prayers.119 That is, they begin with an invocation and praise of the deity or dei-
ties involved. As noted above, Shamash, god of justice, is the god predominantly 
invoked,  often  along  with  Ea  and  Asalluḫi,  gods  of  wisdom  and  magic.120  The 
reason for this, according to Maul, is that  

[e]ven if the great gods Ea, Šamaš, and Asalluhi, whom the conjuror had sum-
moned, were not the divinities who had sent the . . . omen, they had at the very 
least allowed  the person to be  burdened with that fate. Only  when the person 
involved had convinced the gods, especially Šamaš, the god of law (kittu) and 
justice (mīšaru),  that  the impending, evil fate  would befall  him unjustly, could 
the sinister power of the harbinger . . . be broken.121  

After the introduction, the prayers turn to a description of the problem (lament) 
and the request for its resolution (petition). The lament often includes a descrip-
tion of the sign (ina/aššu lumun X, “on account of the evil of X”) and how it af-
fected  the  supplicant,  typically  stated  as  palḫāku  adrāka  u  šutādurāku,  “I  am 
afraid,  anxious,  and  constantly  in  fear.”122  The  petition  part  of  the  namburbi-
prayer is invariably concerned with requesting the deity to avert the impending 
evil from the supplicant and to make the evil keep its distance. The prayers gen-
erally conclude with a brief promise of praise. 

The ritual instructions typically complement the petitions of the prayer via 
the actions prescribed against the omen bearer or, as is often the case, its substi-
tute  in  the  form  of  a  figurine.123  The  evil  was  transferred  symbolically  to  the 
omen bearer/substitute in some way (e.g., the water used to purify the suppli-
cant was poured over the omen bearer)124 and then eliminated (e.g., the omen 
bearer or its substitute was tossed into the river, placed on a boat going down-
stream,  or carried off by a fish or bird).125 After another rite of purification,126 
the supplicant might be told, for example, to return home, go to another place, 
or to enter a tavern, being careful not to look back or to return on the same path 
by which they had come.127 Sometimes the supplicant would also be required to 
wear an amulet necklace for a prescribed number of days.128 

 
119  In fact, Mayer (UFBG, 35) uses a namburbi-prayer, Shamash 25 (see page 421) as an example 
of the typical structure of an incantation-prayer in the introduction to his study. 
120  Other gods could be invoked in prayers, too (e.g., Naru, “the deified River,” and Ishtar). 
121  “How the Babylonians Protected Themselves,” 125. 
122  Although  other  incantation-prayers  use  these  formulae,  they  are  found  very  frequently  in 
namburbi-prayers. See Mayer, UFBG, 73–74. 
123  As Maul mentions, a few namburbis require the use of a figurine of the one affected by the 
omen—the supplicant themselves. This substitute then receives the evil and symbolically suffers 
its effects instead of the real person. See ZB, 74–75. 
124  See ibid., 72–84, with the accomplishment of the transfer via items other than water begin-
ning on 76.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

As one might surmise from the  prominence of Shamash,  god of justice, in 
the  ritual  recitations,  namburbi-rituals  are  permeated  with  legal language.  De-
spite the legal imagery’s importance, it is probably overstepping the bounds of 
evidence to suggest, as does Maul, that the namburbi-ritual is patterned exclu-
sively  on  a  legal  trial,129  ending  with  a  river  ordeal  for  the  evil  bearer.130  As 
Veldhuis  points  out,  the  legal  imagery  is  an  important  perspective  to  keep  in 
mind  while  interpreting  the  namburbis  but  not  all  examples  fit  this  model  as 
well as others.131 For example, not all namburbis end with the evil bearer being 
cast into the river (see Maul, ZB, 89–90). Moreover, focus on the legal aspects 
may lead to neglecting other useful perspectives. 
 
Although there are a couple of Akkadian and Hittite tablets from Hattusha 
that preserve rituals of releasing evil, suggesting OB forerunners for namburbi-
ritual texts, by far our most numerous sources for namburbi-rituals come from 
first  millennium  sites  in  Babylonia  and  Assyria  and  are  written  in  SB  Akkadi-
an.132  The  textual  witnesses  to  namburbi-rituals  come  down  to  us  in  various 
forms:  some  rituals  appear  in  the  omen  tablets  themselves  as  a  brief  insertion 
after the related omens that the namburbi-ritual counteracts; a couple of rituals 
are part of a larger medical-ritual compendium that includes various other texts; 
many  namburbi-rituals  are  preserved  individually  on  a  tablet,  one  ritual  per 
tablet; others are transmitted on Sammeltafeln, that is, tablets that collect a num-
ber of namburbi-rituals, which may or may not be thematically organized; final-
ly,  some  namburbi-rituals  are  preserved  on  amulets,  suggesting  that  even  the 
inscribed  tablet  itself  had  apotropaic  effectiveness.133  According  to  Maul,  evi-
dence suggests that namburbi-rituals were arranged into a series of at least 136 
tablets for Ashurbanipal’s library. Unfortunately, evidence is currently too sparse 
to reconstruct the series.134 Letters from Assyrian and Babylonian scholars to the 
king, however, provide important evidence for the preparation and actual execu-
tion of namburbi-rituals in the Assyrian capital.135

Comparative Study. Assen: Van Gorcum, 1985, 121–24. {A brief look at the ritual set-
ting  and  purpose  of  these  prayers.}  Margaret  Jaques  at  the  University  of  Zurich  is 
publishing a fuller edition and study of the dingirshadibbas, including the prayers and 
their rituals. Her study will also address their reception history and reuse, too. 

Dingirshadibba-prayers  take  their  name  from  the  Sum.  rubric  that  some-
times occurs at their conclusion: ka-inim-ma dingir-šà-dib-ba gur-ru-da-kam, “it 
is  the  wording  for  appeasing  (lit.  turning  back)  an  angry  god.”136  Because  the 
wording of the prayer is often preceded by the én superscript modern scholars 
refer to them as incantation-prayers. As the name dingirshadibba suggests, these 
incantation-prayers were used for penitential purposes; that is, they were prayed 
when one needed to turn back the wrath of a god. Like the other Akkadian in-
cantation-prayers  discussed  above,  the  dingirshadibba-prayers were part  of  the 
professional sphere of the exorcist (see KAR 44, obv. 4 and parallels).137 Themat-
ically, the dingirshadibbas are not distinctive since several other kinds of prayers 
were  also  intended  to  appease  the  anger  of  various  gods  (e.g.,  ershaḫunga-
prayers138 and the still rather poorly known shigu-prayers139). What is distinctive 
about  the  dingirshadibba-prayers  is  the  deity  to  whom  they  were  typically  di-
rected: the personal deity.140 (For more on personal deities, see page 431.)  

Because the supplicant was quite familiar with the addressee, many of the 
dingirshadibba-prayers have a more  intimate and personal tone than the other 
kinds  of  prayers  in  this  volume.  The  opening  may  exemplify  this  tone  best.141 
Rather  than  beginning the prayer  with  an  invocation  and a  long  string  of  epi-
thets  that  invoke,  honor,  and  praise  the  deity  being  addressed,  the  dingirsha-
dibba-prayers typically begin with a very short invocation, sometimes as simple 
 
136  The  rubric  does  not  occur  in  all  of  the  examples  that  Lambert  reconstructed.  Some  of  the 
prayers he treats in his edition were classified as dingirshadibba-prayers by content alone. His 
edition, as he states, is tentative (“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 267). Jaques reads the third 
sign of the prayer’s name as dab (see the lexical section of ṣabātu in CAD Ṣ, 6), thus, dingir-šà-
dab-ba. The meaning is, however, the same. 
137  See footnote 108 above for the most recent edition of this text. 
138  In fact, Lambert has shown that some texts he edits as dingirshadibbas were also known in 
the form of bilingual and unilingual Sumerian ershaḫunga-prayers. See his lines 71–108 (“DING-
IR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 278–81, 288–93, and 297–304) and Maul, HB, 213–15. For more on 
ershaḫunga-prayers, see page 43 below. 
139  See  Mayer,  UFBG,  15  for  the  handful  of  prayers  that  falls  into  this  small  category  and  his 
pages  111–13  for  their  characteristic  features.  The  most  recent  treatment,  with  references  to 
literature since Mayer, is van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia, 117–21, with 
a  few  texts treated in  125–36.  See also  the  earlier  work by  M.-J.  Seux,  “Šiggayôn  =  šigû?”  in 
Mélanges  bibliques  et  orientaux  en  l’honneur  de  M.  Henri  Cazelles  (ed.  A.  Caquot  and  M.  Delcor; 
AOAT 212; Kevelaer: Butzon & Bercker / Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1981), 419–38. 
140  As Lambert notes, the rubric is not applied in an entirely consistent manner to generic per-
sonal gods since occasionally a dingirshadibba-prayer addresses a high god such as Sin or Mar-
duk and Zarpanitu (“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 268).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

as  “my  god”  (ilī).  When  other  epithets  follow  they  often  have  some  personal 
connection to the supplicant. Lines 40–41 of Lambert’s provisional edition of the 
dingirshadibbas provide a notable example in this respect, though the opening is 
longer than is usual: ilī bēlī bānû šumīya nāṣir napištīya mušabšû zērīya, “my god, 
my lord, ‘builder’ of my name, guardian of my life, creator of my progeny.”142  

Unlike  the  other  classes  of  incantation-prayers,  the  dingirshadibba-prayers 
do not show a common structure, although laments, petitions, and, in a few cas-
es, a promise of praise can be found variously in the prayers. Thematically, ding-
irshadibba-prayers are focused on the supplicant’s personal sin. Both confession 
of sin and pleas of ignorance (in general and about sin specifically) dominate the 
prayers, finding expression in direct statements (e.g., mādū arnūya ēma ēpušu ul 
īde, “my iniquities are many! I do not know what I did!”),143 questions (e.g., mīnu 
annūya kīam epšēku, “what are my sins (that) I am treated thus?”),144 and meta-
phors (e.g., alpu anākū-ma šammu ākulu ul īde, “I am an ox; I do not know the 
plant that I eat.”).145 One also finds various statements that assert the inherent 
sinfulness of humanity and the remoteness of the divine realm, suggesting that 
because sin is inevitable and the deity so remote human frailties should be ex-
cused.146 

We do not know whether the dingirshadibba-prayers were arranged into a 
series as were the namburbis in Nineveh. There is at present no published colo-
phon evidence to go on. We do know, however, that the prayers were used with 
various  ritual  actions147    and  in  various  ritual  settings.  As  the  evidence  is  still 
rather thin, a fuller treatment of the ritual setting of these prayers must await 
Margaret  Jaques’  new  edition  in  her  Habilitation  at  the  University  of  Zurich. 
Lambert mentions the incorporation of dingirshadibba-prayers into Bīt rimki and 
their  apparent  use  in  a  ritual  preserved  on  KAR  90  (which  was  followed  by 
Šurpu);  but  he  was  reticent  to  discuss  the  ritual  setting  of  the  dingirshadibbas 
further because the evidence was “too incomplete and uncertain in every respect 
for any overall view to be obtained.”148 Karel van der Toorn offers a brief discus-
sion of some of the diverse occasions for the performance of these incantation-
prayers  in the hopes that understanding  “[t]he ritual Sitz im Leben of the indi-
vidual prayers may . . . furnish the key to a better comprehension of their place 
in  the more elaborate rituals”149  (such  as  Bīt  rimki).  He  believes  the  dingirsha-
dibbas were “designed for situations in which the general circumstances point to

the wrath of the personal gods,”150 which is supported by the citation of a ding-
irshadibba in what he believes are diagnostic texts. After looking at some shared 
terminology in the prayers and the diagnostic texts, he concludes that “the dingi-
ršadibbas with their rather vague rubrics represent the therapeutic counterpart of 
the diagnostic texts.”151 Sally Butler has noticed that prayers very similar to the 
dingirshadibba-prayers  (though  the  dingirshadibba-rubric  is  lacking)  are  pre-
scribed in what she calls the Ashur Dream Ritual Compendium, col. iv, lines 21–
30 and 31–41b.152 These sections of the compendium  are intended to induce a 
pleasant dream (see lines 30 and 41b). Apparently, one impediment to a pleas-
ant dream was the anger of personal deities. Thus, it seems that the prayers were 
used in this case to reconcile the gods to the supplicant prior to their going to 
sleep.

An  ershaḫunga-prayer  (Sum.  ér-šà-ḫun-gá),155  as  the  name  indicates,  is  a 
 
“lament to appease the heart (of a god).” Although these prayers were originally 
written in the Emesal dialect of Sumerian, most of the texts were provided with 
an  Akkadian  interlinear  translation.156  The  ershaḫunga-prayers  show  various 
affinities with  the Sumerian balags and ershemmas,157 but they do not  address

155  This brief introduction relies on Maul’s (HB, 1–72). The name of the prayer is always written 
logographically  in  Akkadian  contexts.  Maul  believes  the  loanword  was  probably  more  likely 
written as eršaḫungakku than eršaḫungû (see ibid., 1, n.1 and compare CDA, 79).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

political  concerns  or  lament  the  destruction  of  a  sanctuary.  They,  rather,  are 
spoken by an individual with personal concerns, ultimately, to appease an angry 
god.  Thematically,  therefore,  ershaḫunga-prayers  are  very  similar  to  the  ding-
irshadibbas.  The  ershaḫungas  differ  conspicuously,  however,  from  the  ding-
irshadibba-prayers  in  several  respects:  the  ershaḫunga-prayers  belong  to  the 
corpus of the cult-singer (kalû), they do not begin with the én superscript, they 
show a common structure, and they are not exclusively directed to the personal 
god. 

Maul’s edition of the ershaḫungas presents the text of over one hundred for-
ty different prayers, many of which are fragmentary.158 Although the divine ad-
dressee of some of these prayers is impossible to determine  due  to damage on 
the tablet, there are prayers attested for many well-known high deities such as 
Anu, Aya, Ishtar, Enlil, Ninlil, Nusku, Damkina, Ea, Sin, Shamash, Marduk, Ni-
nurta, Zarpanitum, and Tashmetum, among others,  as well as prayers to other 
gods, such as the ones directed to a personal god159 and to “any god” (included 
in this volume, see page 447). Although the form goes back to OB times,160 most 
of the currently known prayers come from the first millennium and were discov-
ered in the remains of Ashurbanipal’s library in Nineveh, though other sites have 
yielded some prayers, too.161  
The ershaḫunga-prayers exhibit a common structure.162 Each prayer begins 
 
with an introductory litany, which  has four thematic variations:163 praise (e.g., 
bēlum puluḫtaka galtat, qarrādu abu Adad puluḫtaka galtat “O lord, your terror is 
frightening!  O  hero,  father  Adad,  your  terror  is  frightening!”);164  wooing  (e.g., 
anāku ana bēlīya taṣlītum luqbīšu, qarrādu abu Adad taṣlītum luqbīšu, “I will speak 
a prayer to my lord, the hero, father Adad, I will speak a prayer!”);165 petitioning 
(e.g., ša bēlim nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra, “may the anger of the lord’s heart

85 [reference courtesy of C. Jay Crisostomo]).  
158  Due to their partial preservation,  some of these prayers may turn  out to belong  to  another 
genre. 
159  Lambert  treated  the  text  as  a  dingirshadibba-prayer,  but  he  also  recognized  that  some  MSS 
labeled the text an ershaḫunga (see footnote 138 above). 
160  See Maul, HB, 9–10 for a short list of OB prayers with close affinities to the first millennium’s 
ershaḫunga-prayers. See also his edition of BM 29632 (with references to the secondary litera-
ture, 10–15), which bears the ershaḫunga rubric. (The tablet was originally recognized and pub-
lished by Piotr Michalowski, “On the Early History of the Ershahunga Prayer,” JCS 39 [1987], 
37–48. On the basis of this tablet, Michalowski proposed to identify a number of OB prayers as 
ershaḫungas [42–43]).

preserving ritual instructions that include the recitation of an ershaḫunga-prayer was discovered 
at Sultantepe.

return  to  normal”  [or  “relent,”  lit.  “return  to  its  place”],  see  page  449),166  or 
lamenting (e.g., anāku ana bēltīya mīnâ ēpuš, “what have I done to my lady?”).167  
The  lament follows this  opening litany  and  occupies  a prominent place  in 
the text. The lament typically describes the effect of suffering upon the suppli-
cant’s  body  but  details  are  usually  lacking,  making  the  prayers  applicable  to 
many  situations.  According  to  Maul’s  interpretation  of  the  laments,  “the  de-
scribed  symptoms  such  as  tears,  tremors,  moans,  sleeplessness,  debilitation, 
grief,  and depression are  not to be seen  as the actual complaint, but rather as 
secondary evils.”168 These symptoms are the results of something deeper, name-
ly, the supplicant’s offense against the deity. Thus, one finds confessions of sin 
(and  ignorance)  and  requests  for  forgiveness  in  the  lament  section  of  the  er-
shaḫungas,  which  often  look  similar  to  what  one  finds  in  the  dingirshadibba-
prayers (see above, page 40). In the transition between the lament and the peti-
tion one may find the description of a ritual act of the supplicant similar to what 
Mayer calls a Hinwendung, a “turning”169 (e.g., kneeling, calling out, kissing the 
feet  of  the  deity,  etc.).  In  conjunction  with  the  supplicant’s  confession  of  sin, 
these acts often have a penitential character.170 

The petition follows upon the lament, as it does in the incantation-prayers. 
In this section the supplicant calls upon the deity to remedy the breach in their 
relationship and to bring the supplicant’s suffering to an end. It is common for 
this section to begin with a mention of the word that the supplicant wishes the 
deity  to  speak,  the  word  that  could  put  an  end  to  the  supplicant’s  tribulation: 
aḫulap,  “(it  is)  enough!”  Like  the  incantation-prayers, the supplicant may peti-
tion  the  deity  for  forgiveness  of  sins,  renewed  attention,  and/or  restoration  of 
health and well-being.171 Between the petition and the next section, the interces-
sory litany, many ershaḫunga-prayers have a promise of praise. 
 
In  the  intercessory  litany  the  supplicant  calls  on  their  personal  deities  as 
well  as  deities  related  to  or  associated  with  the  primary  deity  invoked  in  the 
prayer (e.g., if Enlil is invoked, one will find Ninlil, his wife, and Nusku, his vi-
zier, called upon in this section, among others).172 The supplicant seeks the help 
of these other gods in securing the divine appeasement of the primary deity ad-
dressed in the prayer, sometimes requesting that the intercessory deities speak a 
prayer on the supplicant’s behalf.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

 
The  final  section  is  aptly  called  the  “concluding  formula”  (Die  Eršaḫunga-
Schlußformel) and appears in all but one ershaḫunga-prayer treated by Maul (the 
exception is his no. 47). It reads in Sumerian as follows: 
 
 

šà-zu šà-ama-tu-ud-da-gim ki-bi-šè ḫa-am-gi4-gi4 
ama-tu-ud-da a-a-tu-ud-da-gim ki-bi-šè ḫa-am-gi4-gi4 

The Akkadian translation, when provided, reads thus:173 
 
 

libbaka kīma libbi ummi ālittim ana ašrīšu litūra 
kīma ummi ālitti abi ālidi ana ašrīšu litūra 

May your heart, like the heart of the mother who gave birth (to me) return to 
     normal, 
Like the mother who gave birth (to me), the father who engendered (me), may 
     it return to normal. 

The prayers  currently  attested are written on one-column tablets with one 
prayer per tablet. There are no ritual instructions included on the tablets attest-
ing  ershaḫunga-prayers.  However,  there  are  other  tablets  consisting  of  ritual 
instructions that prescribe the use of ershaḫunga-prayers in various ritual com-
plexes.  These  ritual  instructions  often  include  the  recitation  of  balags  and 
ershemmas  before  the  recitation  of  the  ershaḫunga-prayers.174  The  ritual  texts 
have  both  cultic  and  apotropaic  purposes.  The  latter,  according  to  NA  letters 
from scholars, are always connected to the king. It seems plausible to presume, 
however,  based  on  the  individualistic  content  of  the  prayers,  that  the  prayers 
may have (also?) been used, originally, at least, by private citizens. But there is 
currently no evidence to support this.

The Akk. term ikribu is often used as a generic term for prayer (see CAD I/J, 
62, 65–66). Due to its distinctive employment in the rubrics of divinatory ritual 
texts, however, the term has also come to designate a specific kind of prayer of 
the diviner. As Ivan Starr describes it,

INTRODUCTION 

47

[t]he  term  ikribu  must  be  understood  within  a  ritual  setting:  it  is  bound 
with the acts accompanying each step of the diviner’s ritual activities in the 
course of performing an extispicy. The ikribu forms an integral part of such 
a set of rituals. This suggests the following definition: an ikribu is a prayer 
organically bound with each particular step in the ritual activities of the di-
viner, and recited by him in the course of performing an extispicy.176 

Note, however, that the term is not always employed in a consistent manner by 
Assyriologists.  It  has  been  extended  by  some  scholars  to  other  prayers  of  the 
diviner  that  contain  content  similar  to  the  ikribu-prayers  yet  do  not  bear  the 
ikribu-rubric (see page 85).177 
 
As Starr’s comments have already shown, the ikribu-prayers are embedded 
in a broader ritual text/performance—indicated sometimes explicitly by the sur-
rounding ritual instructions on the tablet or only implicitly by the content of the 
prayer itself or the sequence in which several prayers are ordered. Throughout 
the course of the  ikribu-ritual the diviner prepares and performs in a  series of 
steps the ritual slaughter of the animal used for divination (i.e., extispicy). For 
each  step  of  the  ritual  process  an  ikribu-text  may  contain  ritual  instructions 
about the diviner’s actions and/or an indication of the appropriate ritual word-
ing (prayer) that accompanies the actions. When the text of a prayer is given on 
the tablet, the purpose of the prayer is identified with a rubric, ikrib X, in which 
X stands for the ritual action of a particular step in the larger ritual process. For 
example, Zimmern, BBR, no. 95, a fragmentary tablet, preserves five rubrics (see 
lines 2, 12, 20, 25, and 31) to five different ikribu-prayers preserved (partially) 
on the tablet.178 There are no ritual instructions surrounding the prayers, but the 
five rubrics clearly outline various ritual steps in the process of an extispicy: 

2.  [ikrib]  ina  surti  [bīni  nadê],  “an  ikribu-prayer  that  accompanies  the  setting 
down of a circle of tamarisk wood.” 
12. [ikrib kalli upunta179 mullî-ma] kunni, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the 
filling and setting out of a bowl of flour.” 

 
176  Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 45. Ikrib is W. G. Lambert’s preferred designation, as mentioned in 
an oral communication to the Würzburg Rencontre Assryiologique Internationale in 2008 (per-
sonal communication, Christopher Frechette) and utilized in his work on the tamitu-prayers (see, 
e.g., Babylonian Oracle Questions, 12). He argues that because the construct form is always used 
in the rubric, that form of the word should be the name of this class of the diviners’ prayers. 
177  See, e.g., Mayer, UFBG, 32, n.63,  who lists some (OB) texts that do not have the rubric to-
gether with ones that do bear it. (The list is now out-dated.) See also L. de Meyer, “Deux prières 
ikribu du Temps d’Assmī-ṣaduqa,” in Zikir Šumim: Assyriological Studies Presented to F. R. Kraus on 
the  Occasion  of  his  Seventieth  Birthday  (ed.  G.  van  Driel,  Th.  J.  H.  Krispijn,  M.  Stol,  and  K.  R. 
Veenhof; Leiden: Brill, 1982), 271–78, who uses the label ikribu for two OB prayers that do not 
actually bear the rubric. (See likewise the mention of a third prayer at 271, n.7.) 
178  Line 32 seems to begin a sixth prayer. 
179  Zimmern,  BBR,  210  reads  upuntu  (also  written  upumtu)  here  while  CAD  (e.g.,  K,  83)  reads 
maḫaṣtu. Both words denote some kind of flour.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

20. [ikrib erēni ina upun]ti zuqqupi (or sukkupi), “an ikribu-prayer that accompa-
nies the setting up(?)180 of cedar in flour.” 
25. [ikrib nignakka] pēnta mullî-ma kunni, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the 
filling of a censor with charcoal and setting (it) out.” 
31. [ikrib p]uḫādi ḫuppi, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the purifying of the 
lamb.” 

The fact that these prayers are to be recited sequentially within a broader ritual 
is demonstrated by another ikribu-text that preserves ritual instructions prescrib-
ing a series of recitations of ikribu-prayers and their associated ritual actions, all 
of which precisely match the sequence above (see BBR, nos. 75–78: 22–29).181  

Ikribu-prayers typically begin with the invocation of Shamash and Adad, the 
gods of extispicy, though other deities could be invoked, too (e.g., Ninurta as the 
star Sirius,182 Ishtar of Nineveh, and Sin). The wording of the invocation of Sha-
mash and Adad is almost always the same: Šamaš bēl dīnim u Adad bēl bīri, “O 
Shamash, lord of judgment, Adad, lord of divination.”183 The middle section of 
the  prayers  contains  statements  and  petitions  appropriate  to  whatever  ritual 
actions  are  being  prescribed.  The  most  important  theme  in  this  section  is  ac-
ceptance  of the  diviner’s  ritual  actions.  The prayers  do  not  end  with praise  as 
many  of the prayers  discussed  so  far.  Rather,  they tend  to  conclude with  very 
formulaic  petitionary  phrases  that  lay  emphasis  on  the  central  concern  of  the 
ritual as a whole. For example, YOS 11 23, a long OB text preserving a number 
of  ikribu-prayers,  preserves  the  following  concluding  formula  in  several  brief 
prayers  near  the  tablet’s  end:  ina  imitti  puḫādim  annîm  kittam  u  šumēl  puḫādim 
annîm kittam šuknān, “in the right of this lamb (place) truth, and the left of this 
lamb place truth” (see lines 137, 140, 142). Similarly, the first millennium ikri-
bu-prayers  conclude—when  a  conclusion  is  preserved—with  the  following  for-
mula: Šamaš u Adad izizzānim-ma ina qibītīya nīš qātīya ina mimma mala eppušu 
tamīt akarrabu kitta libši, “O Shamash and Adad, stand here that in my speaking, 
the lifting of my hands, whatever I do, the query that I pray there may be truth!” 
This  final  petition  for  the  gods  to  place  truth  (kittu),  an  idea  that  arises  quite 

 
180  The meaning of zuqqupu or sukkupu is uncertain (see CAD Z, 54). 
181  The same five prayers, referenced by rubric only (the text is not given), appear in the same 
order in Zimmern, BBR, no. 96: 6–10. 
182  For a new edition of the Ninurta as Sirius prayer, see now Werner R. Mayer, “Das Gebet des 
Eingeweideschauers  an  Ninurta,”  Or  n.s.  74  (2005),  51–56  (reference  courtesy  of  Christopher 
Frechette). 
183  There  are  exceptions  to  this  invocation,  however.  See,  e.g.,  YOS  11  23:1  (=  HSM  7494), 
edited by Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 25–106, specifically 30, and AO 7032: 1, given in copy by 
Jean Nougayrol, “Textes hépatoscopiques d’époque ancienne conserves au Musée du Louvre,” RA 
38 (1941), 67–88, specifically 87, transliterated by Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 122. Both of these 
read: Šamaš bēl dīnim u Adad bēl ikribī u bīri, “O Shamash, lord of judgment, Adad, lord of ex-
tispicy-rituals and divination.” See the same additional epithet throughout the ikribu-related OB 
prayer of the diviner, beginning on page 85.

frequently in the ikribu-prayers and others associated with them,184 is the central 
purpose  of  both  the  ikribu-prayer  as  well  as  the  entire  ritual  of  extispicy.  By 
asking the deities to “place truth” the diviner intends to make an “appeal for the 
manifestation of the oracular verdict,”185 an accurate and trustworthy indication 
of the will of the gods in the exta of the animal.  

Unfortunately, the current state of publication of the ikribu-prayers does not 
allow us to discuss issues of standardization or the arrangement of the prayers in 
a  series.  It  is  hoped  that  W.  G.  Lambert’s  promised  edition  will  shed  light  on 
such issues.

Although there is still some question about the precise meaning of the term, 
 
Akk. tamītu is understood by Lambert to mean “oracle question.”186 Despite this 
name, there is no reason to exclude the tamitu-texts from the category of prayer 
as it is defined in this introduction.187 These texts invoke a god and express con-
cerns to that god (albeit in the form of a question) in order to gain divine assis-
tance (in the form of a yes-no response via an extispicy result). All of the texts 
treated in Lambert’s edition are written in SB Akkadian and were found in first 
millennium  contexts,  even  if  it  is  likely  that  some  of  them  go  back  to  OB 
times.188 

The tamitu-prayers address Shamash and Adad as a pair, using the same ep-
ithets in their initial lines as do the ikribu-prayers: “lord of judgment” (bēl dīnim) 
and  “lord  of  divination”  (bēl  bīri),  respectively.  Like  the  ikribu-prayers,189  the 

 
184  The phrase also occurs in the OB prayers related to the diviner treated in this volume. See the 
prayer at page 85 (its lines 13, 18, 33, 41, 49, 53, 57, 66) and the one at page 78 (line 24). 
185  Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 58. 
186  See  Babylonian  Oracle  Questions,  5–7  for  Lambert’s  etymological  discussion.  He  claims  that 
the two very similar words tāmītu (OB tāwītum) and tamītu were “confused or equated” in ancient 
times (6). Starr translates the term similarly, “oracle query” (Queries to the Sungod, 357). CDA, 
402,  following  AHw,  1340  (s.v.  tāwītum),  renders  the  former  “response”  (“Anfragebeantwor-
tung”) and the latter “oath” (“Beschworenes, Eid”) (CDA, 397 and AHw, 1314). 
187  On  the  basis  of  his remarks in  the  introduction,  it is  likely  that  Lambert  would  agree (see 
Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5).  On  the  other hand, von Soden  does  not include tamitus in his 
overview of Akkadian prayers (see his “Gebete II,” 165). 
188  See Babylonian Oracle Questions, 7 and Starr, Queries to the Sungod, xxix. 
189  In fact, some tamitu-prayer colophons preserve the phrase tamīt ikribi, rendered by Lambert 
as “petitionary tamītus”  (Babylonian  Oracle Questions, 5),  which  shows the close relationship of 
the two kinds of texts. For the ikribus and other texts related to tamitus, see ibid., 12–14.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

tamitu-prayers  petition  the  gods  of  extispicy  for  a  judgment.  The  distinctive 
characteristic of the petitions in the tamitus is that they communicate the actual 
query the supplicant wishes the gods to answer. The queries are always couched 
in question form; in fact, the texts are dominated typically by a (sometimes long) 
string  of  questions  that  often  cover the  issue  of  concern  from  various perspec-
tives, “so that,” as Lambert writes, “the answer would not mislead due to defects 
in  the  phraseology  of  the  question.”190  These  questions  are  always  asked  in  a 
fashion that can be answered via an affirmative or negative reply. Sometimes the 
questions  concern  things  beyond  the  control  of  the  supplicant  (e.g.,  a  lunar 
eclipse or whether a pregnant woman will survive delivery), but more often than 
not the questions concern a course of action to which the supplicant wants the 
gods to give the stamp of approval (e.g., a military action). Because the diviners 
were aware of the possibility that even the longest list of questions could leave 
potential loopholes that might lead to an unclear reply, the diviners added what 
is called ezib-clauses (ezib is an imperative meaning “leave  aside,  ignore”)  that 
asked  the  gods  to  overlook  or  dismiss  anything  that  might  impede  a  reliable 
answer. The answer, that is, the decision of the gods, is provided via extispicy, 
though there is one text in which an exceptional means of divination occurs (see 
Lambert’s text no. 15). The answers are not recorded with the tamitus. We do, 
however, have tablets on which diviners report the results of their extispicy ritu-
als for delivery to the person concerned, oftentimes the king.191 

The queries as they have come down to us were not asked for a particular 
occasion;  or  rather,  if  they  were,  the  particulars  were  not  usually  preserved 
(there  are  a  few  exceptions).  Several  lines  of  evidence  taken  together  suggest 
this  conclusion.  First,  some  of  the  textual  witnesses  for  tamitus  preserve  more 
than  one  query-prayer  per  physical  tablet,  indicating  an  attempt  to  create  a 
compendium or series. Although there is no single standardized series of tami-
tus, Lambert presents evidence for several local serial collections from Nimrud, 
Nineveh,  and  some  other  Babylonian  city  (possibly  Sippar  or  Babylon).192  Sec-
ond, some of the texts occur in multiple copies. If these were one-off texts creat-
ed for a particular situation, one would not expect to find multiple copies. Third, 
annanna  and  annannītu  occur  as  substitutes  for  proper  names  within  the  texts 
with only a few exceptions (all of the exceptions are names that go back to the

OB period).193 These generic placeholder words strongly suggest the texts were 
intended to be adapted for a variety of clients. It seems therefore that the tami-
tu-prayers  were  part  of  the  scribal  tradition  and  were  preserved  as  models,  at 
least  potentially,  for  similar  situations  that  might  arise  in  the  future.  Lambert 
finds this idea “certain because different surviving questions on related subjects 
are in part identically worded.”194 

The tablets preserving the tamitus in Lambert’s edition typically include the 
rubric tamīt X at the end of each query, where X represents a thematic distilla-
tion of the text’s query. For example, Lambert’s text no. 1, line 183 reads tamīt 
ana šulum maṣṣarti, “a query for the safety of the guards (lit. watch)” (see page 
470). His text no. 21, line 9 reads tamīt annannītu itti annanna mutīša kīnāti ītam-
mi, “a query concerning whether female so-and-so is speaking the truth (lit. true 
things) to male so-and-so, her husband.” The tamitu-prayers range over a broad 
array of topics including such things as lunar eclipses, the result of a  river  or-
deal, and whether a slave had been faithful to his master, but the success of mili-
tary actions and personal safety are the topics most frequently found.  

The  following  is  a  description  of  the  structure  of  a  typical  tamitu-prayer, 
based on Lambert’s work.195 After the invariable invocation (cited above), tami-
tu-prayers may include an identification of the person for whom the diviner is 
performing  the  extispicy  and  the  stipulated  term,  that  is,  the  time  period  for 
which  the  inquiry  applies  (usually  within  the  month  or  the  year  the  ritual  is 
being performed).  The  question  that  the  supplicant  wishes  the  gods  to  answer 
may  be  presented  at  any  point  after  the  invocation.  The  persuasions  take  the 
form of flattery, ilūtkunu rabītu īde, “your great divinity knows,” or what Lambert 
interprets (cautiously) as an implied threat, āmiru immaru šēmû išemmû, “the seer 
will see (and) the hearer will hear.” The latter is interpreted by Lambert as fol-
lows: “if no answer, or a wrong answer is given, news of this may spread to the 
detriment  of  the  gods’  reputation.”196  The  first  form  of  persuasion  may  occur 
anywhere after the invocation; the second form always comes after the diviner’s 
question. Technical qualifications, that is, the clauses intended to cover possible 
oversights  or  problems  with  the  formulation  of  the  question,  if  present,  occur 
after the question itself. These qualifications are usually expressed with the ezib-
clauses but a “why”-question format, whose meaning is still unclear, is also at-
tested. The tamitu-prayers end in a variety of ways, but the most common is the 
rather  abrupt  (ilūtkunu)  Šamaš  u  Adad  kīam,  “Your  divinity,  O  Shamash  and 
Adad,  thus.”  It is likely that the  kīam  indicates  an  abbreviation  and  should be 
taken  to  mean  “etc.,”  suggesting  that  the  diviner  would  fill  in  the  ending  for 

 
193  The  OB  names  are  all  kings,  Hammurabi,  Abi-Eshuḫ,  and  Samsu-ditana,  and  they  are  only 
mentioned in the Nimrud edition (see Lambert, Babylonian Oracle Questions, 15).

195  See ibid., 14 with his notes on each section in pp. 15–20.

tation (Queries to the Sun God, xix–xx). See note 200 below.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

themselves with some formulaic phrase(s). Sometimes kīam is followed by a de-
scription of the ritual acts involved in the extispicy.197 
 
The tamitu-prayers are very similar to the NA queries to Shamash, written 
during the Sargonid-era (722–609 BCE) in SB Akkadian and edited by Ivan Starr 
in Queries to the Sun God (SAA 4). Unlike the tamitus in Lambert’s edition, these 
prayer-queries are coarsely written one to a tablet without duplicates and seem 
therefore to be intended for one and only one occasion. Also unlike the tamitus, 
they  are  only  addressed  to  Shamash;  Adad  is  entirely  absent.  There  are  many 
structural  similarities  between  the  two  kinds  of  queries  and  they  share  many 
phrases, but on the whole the NA queries are more rigid and formulaic.  

These prayers invariably open with the phrase, Šamaš bēlu rabû ša ašallūka 
anna kīna apalanni, “O Shamash, great lord, whom I am asking, answer me with 
a  firm  yes.”198  The  stipulated  term  is  designated  and  then  follows  the  query 
proper,  formulated  as  a  direct  question,  as  in  the  tamitu-prayers.  Unlike  the 
question in the tamitu-prayers, however, the query in the NA texts have a highly 
formulaic  structure  and  utilize  stereotyped phrases throughout,  some  of  which 
are keyed to particular topics that arise in the queries  somewhat frequently.199 
The  first  and  last  of  three  closing  formulae  in  the  query  correspond  to  what 
Lambert calls persuasions (see above). The middle closing formula in the query 
reads, ina šalimti ina pî ilūtīka rabīti Šamaš bēlu rabû qabi kūn, “with a favorable 
reply, according to the command of your great divinity, O Shamash, great lord, 
speak (and) confirm (it).”200  

The ezib-clauses follow the query. Unlike the tamitu-prayers, these clauses 
are quite extensive in the NA texts and may be divided into three sections. The 
first section of ezibs derives from the particular situation of the query and there-
fore contains clauses of quite variable content. The second section contains ezibs 
that are attested between three and eight times and seem to be somewhat stereo-
typed (e.g., “disregard that  an  angry man, or one in distress spoke angrily the 
words  of  his  report”201).  They  are  much  less  common  than  those  found  in  the 
third  section,  the  standard  ezibs.  These  seven  clauses  are  concerned  with  the 
ritual performance itself and the purity of everything involved in the extispicy 
(the  diviner,  the  lamb,  and  the  location  of  the  ritual).  These  ezibs  are  always 
found  in  the  queries,  appear  in  the  same  order,  and,  apart  from  the  last  two, 
show little variation in their construction and wording.202  

 
197  See Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5, 18–20. 
198  The following general outline of the NA query to Shamash is based on Starr’s work in Queries 
to the Sun God, xvi–xxviii. 
199  See ibid., xviii. 
200  Starr translates all three closing formulae as questions (ibid., xx). The above translation fol-
lows  Lambert’s  notion  that  the  phrases  that  conclude  the  query  are  intended  to  persuade  the 
deity to give a positive reply. Therefore, they are translated as statements. 
201  See ibid., xxi. 
202  See ibid., xxii–xxvii for details. 

 

INTRODUCTION

A standardized formula bridges between the ezibs and the repetition of the 
query:  lū  nasḫā  lū  bērā,  “though  they  (i.e.,  these  formulations)  be  excerpted, 
though they be selected.”203 According to Lambert, this formula, which may also 
conclude a tamitu-prayer, was one last attempt by the diviner to cover all poten-
tial problems in his prayer that might lead to misleading results.204 The repeated 
query, unlike the first occurrence, is stated as an indirect question, ašâlka Šamaš 
bēlu rabû kî, “I ask you, O Shamash, great lord, whether. . . .”  

Two closing formulae end the prayer. The first one has a longer and shorter 
form:205  ina  libbi  immeri  annî  izizzam-ma  anna  kīna  {uṣurāti  šalmāti  šērē  tamīt 
damqāti šalmāti ša pî ilūtīka rabīti} šuknam-ma lūmur, which, following Starr, may 
be translated as “be present (lit. stand) in this sheep, place an affirmative answer 
(in it), {favorable designs, favorable, propitious omens of the oracular query by 
the command of your great divinity} so that I may see (them).” The second clos-
ing formula reads: eli ilūtīka rabīti Šamaš bēlu rabû lillik-ma têrtu lītappal, “[m]ay 
(this) query go to your great divinity, O Shamash, great lord, and may an oracle 
be given as an answer” (again, following  Starr).206 These two closing formulae 
were often written with a gap between them on the tablet, into which the divin-
er recorded the technical results of the extispicy.

and  Israel:  Continuity  and  Change  in  the  Forms  of  Religious  Life.  SHCANE  7.  Leiden: 
Brill, 1996, 130–33. {A brief discussion of OB private letter-prayers.} 

As a preface to the discussion, some important distinctions should be noted 
within the Akkadian material grouped by modern Assyriologists under the head-
ing “letter-prayers.”209 Akkadian letter-prayers in the OB period were written by 
private individuals and kings. Individuals presented personal petitions to a deity, 
probably a personal deity.210 Kings expressed concerns that may be characterized 
as  political  and/or military  in  nature  to  a  deity—issues more  appropriate to  a 
king.211 The literary form of all of these OB letter-prayers is quite comparable to 
a mundane or secular letter. And there is no indication that the senders viewed 
them  as  anything  beyond  just  that  (though  see  below).  (The  identification  of 
these texts as prayer, therefore, derives not from an ancient scribal classification 
but  from  the  modern  definition  of  prayer  that  scholars  have  imposed  on  the 
texts.) In distinction to the OB letter-prayers, the Akkadian letter-prayers in the 
first millennium all derive from the Assyrian imperial court and were composed 
by/for  Assyrian  kings  to  report  their  military  actions  to  the  gods.  These  texts 
display  a  very polished literary  style  and  include various feats  of  heroism  and 
military prowess in order to aggrandize the king.212 Although they begin as do 
letters,  these  texts  show  more  similarities  with  the  Assyrian  royal  inscriptions 
than  mundane  letters.  Without  intending  to prejudice  the  discussion  or to  dis-
qualify  or limit  the  term’s  use  to  only  a  segment  of  this material,  the  ensuing 
discussion is based on the OB letter-prayers from individuals. 

The OB letter-prayers often contain many of the same features as other clas-
ses of prayer discussed in this introduction: an invocation, perhaps a brief divine 
epithet,  laments,  petitions,  and  a  promise  of  praise.  Three  elements,  however, 
make the letter-prayers  distinct  from  the  other prayer  classes  discussed  in  this 
 
209  For a  recent discussion of the Sumerian letter-prayers, see Böck,  “„Wenn du  zu Nintinugga 
gesprochen hast, . . .“,” 3–23. The work of William W. Hallo,  a long-time student of Sumerian 
letter-prayers, is now available in his collected essays volume The World’s Oldest Literature: Stud-
ies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres, 255–367. 
210  Van der Toorn (Family Religion, 131) believes all of the private letter-prayers are addressed to 
a  deity  in  the  capacity  of  a  personal  god.  There  are  only  about  a  half  dozen  or  so  OB  letter-
prayers  from  individuals  (see  van  der  Toorn,  Family  Religion,  130,  n.64).  Those  known  to  me 
include  the  prayers  listed  in  note  207  above  along  with  F.  R.  Kraus,  “Ein  altbabylonischer 
Privatbrief an eine Gottheit,” RA 65 (1971), 27–36. 
211  All of the OB royal letter-prayers are from Mari. See ARM 26=AEM I/1, nos. 191 and 193 
and  ARM 1  3.  On  the  latter, see Jack M. Sasson, “Yasmah-Addu’s Letter to God (ARM I : 3),” 
NABU 1987, #109 (with previous literature). 
212  See, e.g., Riekele Borger, Die Inschriften Asarhaddons Königs von Assyrien (AfO Beiheft 9; Osna-
brück: Biblio-Verlag, 1967 [1956]), 102–7 (§68) for Esarhaddon’s letter to the gods. An English 
translation is available in Daniel D. Luckenbill, Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia, 2 vols.

Jerusalem:  Magnes  Press,  1991),  52–57  offers  a  brief  historical  treatment  (with  literature).  A 
majority of the Akkadian examples listed by Borger in RlA are Assyrian royal letter-prayers. 

 

INTRODUCTION

introduction.  First,  the  letter-prayers  use  the  epistolary  format  to  express  the 
supplicant’s  concerns  to  the  deity.  The  letter-prayers  therefore  begin  as  would 
any standard letter, ana DN qibī-ma umma PN-ma, “To DN, thus says PN.” Sec-
ond, the letter-prayers were written for a particular situation. Therefore, one will 
not find in these prayers the generic annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-
and-so,” formula often found in the other prayers because the OB letter-prayers 
were not intended to be used over and over again. Finally, the OB letter-prayers 
seem to have been used as ex voto objects.213 That is, like a statue placed before 
a deity on one’s behalf (see footnote 27 above), an OB letter-prayer was deposit-
ed before the deity’s image in the shrine. If the evidence of AbB 6, no. 135 may 
be generalized, it seems a letter-prayer was read to the deity (by someone other 
than the supplicant) before being deposited.214 The tablet would then become a 
physical reminder before the deity of the supplicant’s concerns and petitions.  

Royal Prayers:

of several royal prayers and hymns.} 

 
In  many  respects  “royal  prayers”  is  a  non-category  since  nearly  all  of  the 
prayers in this volume were or could have been used by kings of ancient Meso-
potamia.  The  prayers  that  modern  scholars  typically  place  in  this  category, 
therefore, are miscellaneous and occasional prayers that were composed explicit-
ly for royal purposes but do not fit easily elsewhere in the taxonomy of prayers 
used  by  Assyriologists.  Rather  than  list these  in  extenso,  only  the  largest, most 
coherent group of texts is discussed here: the various prayers found in building 
inscriptions. The NB kings almost always ended their building inscriptions with 
a prayer (also referred to as a blessing, Segenswunsch).215 The deity addressed in 
the prayer was determined by what was most appropriate for the structure being 
commemorated  in  the  inscription.216  For example,  the  concluding  prayer to  an 
inscription commemorating Nebuchadnezzar’s restoration of the Ebabbar temple 
at Larsa was directed to Shamash, the resident deity of the temple.217 Examples

ers a translation of what he identifies as “the last datable Akkadian prayer” (866; see also Seux, 
525–26 and von Soden, 291). The prayer, directed at Nabu, occurs in a building inscription from 
the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus Soter (281–261 BCE).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

of this kind of concluding prayer in Assyrian royal inscriptions are rather rare,218 
although the  Assyrian  kings occasionally  had prayers  literally  inscribed on  the 
various parts of their royal  structures.  The particular  god  addressed  by  such  a 
prayer, as was the case in the NB prayers, was determined by the object being 
inscribed. The parade example comes from Dur Shurrukin, where Sargon had a 
short prayer inscribed on the thresholds (or stairs) leading to the temples of Sin, 
Adad, Ninurta, Ea, Ningal, and Nabu.219 In each case, the deity of the temple is 
invoked and then petitioned to grant something to the king such as life, a long 
reign,  good  weather,  etc.  Conspicuously  and  similar  to  the  NB  prayers,  these 
prayers do not end in praise.

Akkadian hymnic material, that is, passages in texts that contain praise to a 
benevolent supra-human entity, exists in a variety of genres in Akkadian: myths 
(e.g., Enūma eliš VI 121–VII 162220), literary texts (e.g., Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 1–40, 
see  page  483),  prayers  (as  already  mentioned  above),  and  royal  inscriptions 
(e.g., in dedicatory inscriptions [ana DN, followed by epithets] or hymnic invo-

a  prayer to  Shamash  also, but it is  very  poorly preserved (Fuchs, Inschriften, 281). See Foster, 
784–87, Seux, 527–30, and von Soden, 279–81 for translations. 
220  Von  Soden  considers  this  material  hymnic,  even  if  not  a  hymn  strictly  speaking  (see  his

cations  in  annalistic  texts221).  Independent  hymnic  compositions  that  praise  a 
benevolent  supra-human  being  (e.g.,  a  god,  but  also  a  king,  temple,  or  even 
city222) comprise a relatively small group in the preserved Akkadian textual cor-
pus. The number of complete or very well-preserved examples is even smaller. 
Unfortunately, despite superscripts and subscripts on some hymnic texts as well 
as the availability of ancient catalogs that organize various lyrical compositions 
under specific labels, modern scholars have not been able to match formal fea-
tures of the hymns with indigenous scribal classificatory labels.223 Introductory 
treatments of hymns, therefore, tend to be compilations of attested texts, orga-
nized by time period, content (e.g., by entity praised or by the human doing the 
praise), and/or various formal characteristics in the hymns that have caught the 
eye of the modern scholar.224  
 
A complete taxonomy of the extant hymns with an exhaustive listing is not 
possible here.225 Rather, the present section provides a selection of notable, rep-
resentative, and relatively well-preserved examples of hymns226 that are availa-
ble in modern editions and translations. Readers desiring to study more hymns 
beyond the couple in this volume might turn to these examples next. 

 
221  For dedicatory texts, see, e.g., two dedications to Adad and Ninurta in A. Kirk Grayson, Assyr-
ian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC: II (858–745 BC) (RIMA 3; Toronto: University of Toron-
to Press, 1996), 59 and 182, respectively. Many others could be cited. See also the hymnic invo-
cations used in, e.g., several versions of the annals of Shalmaneser (Grayson, Assyrian Rulers of 
the Early First Millennium, 13, 26, 33, 51, etc.). 
222  For a  listing of hymns  to the  latter three groups, see Foster,  Akkadian Literature  of  the Late 
Period,  44–47.  For  the  problems  and  artificiality  of  differentiating  between  these,  see  briefly 
Edzard, “Sumerische und akkadische Hymnen,” 22. 
223  The  fragmentary  state  of  many  hymns  has  not  helped  matters.  For  a  discussion  of  hymns, 
scribal  superscripts/subscripts,  and  catalogs,  see  Brigitte  Groneberg,  “Searching  for  Akkadian 
Lyrics: From Old Babylonian to the ‘Liederkatalog’ KAR 158,” JCS 55 (2003), 55–74. Classifica-
tory scribal labels, as Groneberg shows, do not seem to correspond to textual form. Rather, they 
may  have  reflected  the  text’s  musical  accompaniment,  mode  of  performance,  language,  ritual 
function, and/or content.  
224  See, e.g., von Soden, “Hymne. B.  Nach akkadischen Quellen,” 545–48 and Foster, Akkadian 
Literature of the Late Period, 78–91. 
225  For OB hymns, however, the catalog of literary texts in Nathan Wasserman, Style and Form in 
Old-Babylonian Literary Texts (Cuneiform Monographs 27; Leiden/Boston: Styx/Brill, 2003), 187–
224 presents a convenient list of all of the (then) known hymns (many of which are fragmen-
tary).  Add  the  hymn  to  Ningishzida  in  A.  R.  George,  Babylonian  Literary  Texts  in  the  Schøyen 
Collection  (Cornell  University  Studies  in  Assyriology  and  Sumerology  10;  Bethesda:  CDL  Press, 
2009),  no.  7  and  see  also  M.  Krebernik,  “Altbabylonische  Hymnen  an  die  Muttergöttin  (HS 
1884),” AfO 50 (2003–2004), 11–20. The anthologies of Akkadian hymns and prayers (see espe-
cially Foster, Seux, and von Soden) give a large and representative sample of hymns, but they do 
not reflect an exhaustive catalog. Also, Foster, Akkadian Literature of the Late Period, 78–91 pro-
vides an annotated listing of many first millennium examples. 
226  Though, the OB examples are not so well-preserved.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Among OB Texts:  
A hymn to Nanaya (VAS  10  215)  is composed  in fourteen quatrains, as is 
the hymn to Ishtar in this volume (see page 111). The Nanaya hymn is relatively 
well-preserved, though still incomplete.227 

A hymn to Ishtar from the Louvre (AO 6035) was edited by Brigitte Grone-
berg  for  the  first  time  relatively  recently.  Although  the  tablet  is  not  complete 
and an English translation is not available (to my knowledge), Groneberg’s edi-
tion is accompanied by an extensive commentary.228 

Another OB hymn that has regularly found its way into anthologies praises 
the obscure god Papulegarra.229 The tablet probably contains several hymns, but 
breaks make precise demarcations between the hymns impossible.230 

Among SB Texts: 
Although there are several examples that could be listed, two lengthy and 
well-preserved hymns ought to be mentioned first: the Great Shamash Hymn and 
the Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi.  

The Great Shamash Hymn, edited by W. G. Lambert in his book Babylonian 
Wisdom Literature,231 is a two-hundred-line hymn that celebrates a wide array of 
the sun-god’s attributes.232 The hymn begins with Shamash’s role as the universal 
illuminator of darkness, whose light reaches the innermost parts of everything, 
and then continues on to mention various justice-related attributes of the deity: 
investigation of cases, protection of travelers and other innocents, enforcement

228  See Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Lob der Ištar: Gebet und Ritual an die altbabylonsiche Venusgöttin 
(Cuneiform Monographs 8;  Groningen: Styx,  1997), 3–54 for an  edition, translation, and  com-
mentary  (with  plates  I–XXVI).  The  Agushaya  Poem,  also  called  Ishtar  and  Ṣaltu  (ṣaltu  means 
“strife” in Akk.), recounts a chapter in Ishtar’s mythology, but it contains a significant hymnic 
element. See  Groneberg, Lob  der  Ištar, 55–93 for an edition, translation,  and commentary.  See 
Foster, 96–106 and Hecker, TUAT II/5, 731–40 for translations. 
229  See M. Krebernik, “Pap(a)-ule-ĝara,” RlA 10 (2003–2005), 329–30, who draws on the hymn 
just mentioned for most of what the article says about this god. 
230  See Th. G.  Pinches, “Hymns to Pap-due-garra,” JRAS Centenary Supplement  (1924),  63–86 
with  plates  VI–IX  for  an  edition.  Foster,  93–94,  Seux,  46–50,  and  Hecker,  TUAT  II/5,  728–31 
have translated the text.

ler; AOAT 25; Kevelaer: Butzon & Bercker / Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1976), 71–74. 
232  The content of the hymn (“practical advice on living”) led Lambert to include it among his 
collection of “wisdom” texts (Babylonian Wisdom Literature, 5). See page 6 above for the potential 
hortatory purpose of prayers and hymns among human listeners.

of  oaths,  impartial  judgment  of  cases,  ensuring  of  fair  business  transactions, 
helping those in need, granting wisdom to those who ask, etc. 

The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi, also edited by Lambert,233 is another two-
hundred-line hymn, which divides into twenty stanzas of varied length. After an 
introductory line that mentions the goddess in the third person, Gula speaks in 
the first person until line 188, at which point Bulluṭsa-rabi, the putative author 
of the text, begins his concluding petition (in the third person). In the nineteen 
stanzas before Bulluṭsa-rabi’s petition Gula alternates her speech between a stan-
za of self-praise (the topic of which varies from stanza to stanza) followed by a 
stanza of praise for her spouse, Ninurta (the topic of which is always martial). 
Each of these nineteen stanzas ends with the giving of a different name to the 
goddess or god.234  

These  two texts  fall  into  a  category  called  “Great  Hymns  and  Prayers”  by 
Foster.235  In  this  group,  he  lists  seven  hymns/prayers,  distinguished  mostly  by 
their extraordinary length (well over one hundred lines). Other examples of the 
great hymns and prayers include the Great Prayer to Marduk,236 the Great Hymn 
to  Marduk,237  the  Great  Hymn  to  Nabu,238  Ishtar  Queen  of  Heaven,239  and  the 
Great Prayer to Ishtar (for which, see page 257).240 Given the sophistication of

240  Why Foster excludes from his list here the long prayer to Ishtar, edited by Lambert in “Three

in Before the Muses, 606–10 (see also Seux, 194–99).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

these texts in terms of language, style, and content, they are probably the work 
of ancient scholars. 

Ashurbanipal’s hymn to  Ashur  (ABRT I  32–34) provides a good,  if still in-
complete example of a hymn in SB Akkadian from the Neo-Assyrian court.241 In 
this  hymn,  written  for  the  sake  of  Ashurbanipal  (see  rev.  8ʹ),  Ashur’s  name  is 
written as if it were Anshar (AN.ŠÁR), the father of Anu and the great-grandfather 
of  Marduk  according  to  the  Enūma  eliš,  thus  equating  Ashur  with  a  god  older 
than Marduk and exalting Ashur to the head of the pantheon (see rev. 6ʹ). 

The so-called syncretistic hymns laud a deity while equating various other 
gods with aspects of the deity being praised. Several (incomplete) examples are 
known, including a hymn containing a petition to Marduk (KAR 25 ii 3–24),242 
and  hymns  to  Nabu  (LKA  16),243  Ninurta  (KAR  102+328),244  and  Ishtar  (BM 
65454+).245 

Finally,  some  of  the  hymns  preserved  in  Akkadian  display  acrostics,  in 
which the first syllable of  each line  combines to spell out a name, petition, or 
statement of praise. A notable example is found in Ashurbanipal’s hymn to Mar-
duk (ABRT I 29–31+).246 The syllables at the beginning of each line combine to 
spell out anāku Aššur-bāni-apli ša ilsûka bulliṭannī-ma Maruduk (ma-ru-du-uk) da-
lilīka  ludlul,  “I  (am)  Ashurbanipal,  who  has  called  out  to  you,  O  Marduk.  Pre-
serve me that I may sing your praises!”247

THE USE OF AKKADIAN PRAYERS IN THE STUDY OF THE HEBREW BIBLE:  
Anna Elise Zernecke 

Scholars of the Hebrew Bible have compared Akkadian prayers and hymns 
to  the  biblical  text  since  the  late  nineteenth  century,  when  publications  and 
translations of the  Akkadian texts first appeared.  Unfortunately, the interest in 
these texts was much greater at the beginning of the twentieth century than it is 
today. The following pages outline the use of Akkadian prayers in the history of 
biblical  scholarship,  assess  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  the  various  ap-
proaches employed, and conclude by offering some prospects for future compar-
ative work.248  

The first editions and translations of prayers of the lifting of the hand were 
published in 1896 by King. The title of King’s book, Babylonian Magic and Sor-
cery. Being ‘The Prayers of the Lifting of the Hand’, already indicates that he was 
not sure whether the texts were to be classified as religious or magical.249 This 
insecurity is also clear in the introduction where he characterizes these texts as 
“a complete group of tablets inscribed with prayers and religious compositions 
of  a  devotional  and  somewhat magical  character.”250  The  qualification  of their 
character  as  magical  or  religious  has  also  influenced  the  interest  of  biblical 
scholars in these texts, so that decisions in favor of one of these categories or the 
other  often  gave  direction  to  the  Akkadian  texts’  reception  and  interpretation. 
The transmission of the texts as part of a ritual was deemed very important in 
this regard, though the ritual instructions were often not included in Assyriolog-
ical editions.  

Shortly after the first editions appeared, anthologies of translated texts aim-
ing at a wider public made the Akkadian prayers more easily accessible.251 Bibli-
cal scholars at this time began using the Akkadian prayers as parallels to biblical 
prayers,  especially  the  Psalms.  The  “religionsgeschichtliche  Schule”  had  just 
started to establish itself. Therefore, it is not surprising that the first monograph 
that compares biblical Psalms with Akkadian prayers, the Habilitation of Stum-
mer, written in Würzburg in 1917, used its form-critical methodology.252 Along 
with  his  innovative  method,  Stummer  also  pursued  another  question  that  has 
often been asked since the Akkadian prayers were discovered: Is there a genetic

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

relationship between the Akkadian and Hebrew prayers? Stummer answers this 
by  stating  that  the  authors  of  the  Psalms  in  fact  knew  Mesopotamian  prayers. 
Due  to  the  Akkadian  material’s  state  of publication  at  the  time  of  his  writing, 
Stummer mixes texts of many genres and does not differentiate between Sumeri-
an and  Akkadian material. But the more basic problem  in his work is that the 
comparison is done with a theological aim: he wants to establish the high reli-
gious level of Israel’s sacred poetry.253 Following Gunkel’s form-critical method-
ology  at  that  time,  Stummer  had  taken  Gunkel’s  statement  that  there  was  no 
more pressing task for Old Testament scholarship than the systematic compari-
son of the Babylonian and Hebrew religious poetry as an impetus for his work.254 
In  response  to  Stummer’s  work,  however,  Gunkel  and  Begrich  wrote  in  their 
Introduction to the Psalms (1933)255 that the time had not yet come for a system-
atic comparison of both literatures, as neither of them had been independently 
and thoroughly studied.256  

Nevertheless, it was Begrich, who analyzed one aspect of Biblical and Meso-
potamian  prayers  in  a  comparative perspective  in  an  article  entitled  “Die  Ver-
trauensäußerungen  im  israelitischen  Klageliede  des  Einzelnen  und  in  seinem 
babylonischen Gegenstück” (1928).257 Begrich’s approach is much more cautious 
than  Stummer’s.  He  first  establishes  the  comparability  of biblical  and  Mesopo-
tamian  prayers,  discussing  the  superscriptions  and  subscriptions,  the  person  of 
the supplicant, and their situation. After this, he analyzes the main differences 
between the psalms of individual lament and prayers of the lifting of the hand. 
Instead of a personal confession of trust as in the biblical texts, the Babylonian 
prayers show descriptions of the magnificence of the deity. For Begrich, the un-
derlying relationship between god and man is different in both cultures: where 
there  is trusting confidence in the biblical material  because of a personal rela-
tion, in Mesopotamia, the distance between the supplicant and the deity is such 
that the striving for a relationship based on trust is squelched by the conscious-
ness  of  the  grandeur  of  the  deity.258  Many  more  Mesopotamian  texts  are  pub-
lished today and the editions are much more detailed, making Begrich’s results

out-of-date. Still, his cautious and precise methodology retains its value for con-
temporary scholarship.  

Shortly after its publication, Begrich’s conclusions were contested in one of 
the first Assyriological monographs dealing with the literary form of Mesopota-
mian  prayers,  Kunstmann’s  dissertation  Die  babylonische  Gebetsbeschwörung 
(1932).259  It  was  presumably  this  publication  that  coined  the  term  “Gebets-
beschwörung”  (incantation-prayer),  following  Kunstmann’s  teacher  Lands-
berger. Kunstmann’s methodology is form-critical. He distinguishes “allgemeine” 
(general)  and  “spezielle” 
(incantation-
prayers). In the special variety, the magical act is dominant. In the general in-
cantation-prayers, on the other hand, the prayer is the main and sometimes only 
thing.260 This distinction has not stood the test of time (see above, page 28). 

(special)  “Gebetsbeschwörungen” 

In the years following, several biblical scholars used prayers from Mesopo-
tamia  as  parallels  for  biblical  texts.  Widengren’s  monograph  The  Accadian  and 
Hebrew  Psalms  of  Lamentation  as  Religious  Documents  (1937)  is  an  early  exam-
ple.261  Widengren  is  not  interested  in  the  literary  development  of  the  prayers, 
but in the comparison of religions. He presupposes an opposition of cult religion 
and religious literature and sees a direct dependence of the biblical prayers on 
Akkadian religious literature. Widengren’s book consists of long lists of phrases 
from both types of texts and their interpretation. Though focusing on “cult reli-
gion,”  the  precise  cultic  setting  of  the  texts  is  oddly  not  taken  into  account. 
Widengren’s monograph is now of little more than historical interest; his main 
thesis has not been followed.  

Another  comparative  approach,  again  more  form-critical  in  orientation,  is 
taken  by  Castellino  in  his  Le Lamentazioni  individuali  e  gli  inni  in  Babilonia  e  in 
Israele. Raffrontati riguardo alla forma e al contenuto (1940).262 Castellino’s study 
compares individual laments and hymns from Mesopotamia and Israel. He first 
establishes the general compatibility of the texts by describing each corpus sepa-
rately  and  then  compares  the  results.  Despite  this  cautious  methodology,  the 
results of the study are hampered by Castellino’s notion of magic, which is never 
made  explicit.  He  states  that  all  Babylonian  individual  prayers  are  essentially 
magical incantations aiming at coercing the gods. Therefore, his study ends up 
being a comparison of the “Hebrew” and the “Babylonian-Assyrian religions,” in 
which Israel certainly comes out as superior.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

1953),263 a new form-critical assessment of the relation between Mesopotamian 
and Biblical prayers took shape in Westermann’s study Das Loben Gottes in den 
Psalmen  (first  published  in  1954).264  Following  Stummer  and  Kunstmann,  his 
main focus is on the hymnic introduction. Noting that Mesopotamian prayers of 
lament have a hymnic introduction that has no equivalent in psalms of lament, 
Westermann argued that this indicates that there are two different genres in the 
Bible (the individual lament and what Westermann calls the hymn of descriptive 
praise) whereas there is only one in Mesopotamia. The hymnic passages are seen 
as  praise  of  the  deity  within  the  pantheon  in  Mesopotamia,  whereas  in  Israel 
Yahweh has a history with his people which is praised. In other words, Mesopo-
tamians praised the gods in their cosmic function and their general actions and 
the Israelites praised their god for what  he had  done for them in history.  One 
problem with this approach is that Westermann only looks at the abstract struc-
tures without taking into account their concretion in the individual texts. Also, 
he does not see that in the hymnic passages of Akkadian prayers, the character-
istics of the deity, which are vital for the problems of the supplicant, are often 
praised, therefore establishing a relationship between god and supplicant. 

The general problem of many form-critical approaches is that the peculiari-
ties of the individual texts are overlooked in overall comparisons of genres. Dal-
glish’s monograph avoids this at least on one side: one single text, Psalm 51,265 is 
analyzed with parallels in structure and content from all over the ancient Near 
East. The aim is to establish the relationship between biblical and ancient Near 
Eastern  prayer  literature.  The  particularistic  analysis  of  only  one  side  of  the 
comparison, however, makes the study somewhat lopsided. Dalglish explains the 
similarities  in  the  ancient  Near  Eastern  and  biblical  texts  partly  as  a  common 
Proto-Semitic  heritage  and  partly  as  influence  of  these  other  texts  on  Hebrew 
literature.266 But still, in his opinion, the differences outweigh the similarities. 

After these studies, the form-critical approach lost its appeal to many bibli-
cal scholars. A symptom of this can be seen in Muilenburg’s presidential address 
at the annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in 1968.267 Yet among 
Assyriologists the most  important  form-critical  analysis  of Akkadian  prayers  of

INTRODUCTION

„Gebetsbeschwörungen“ (1976),268 was only published after the majority of Bibli-
cists had lost interest. Mayer closely follows Kunstmann’s study and meticulous-
ly  collects  the  phrases  and  their  combinations  in  every  part  of  the  prayers  he 
analyzes. This book was cited and studied among biblical scholars, but it could 
not trigger a new initiative for comparing Akkadian and Hebrew prayers, even 
though many of the former drawbacks in such work would now have been much 
easier to overcome. Still, the Akkadian prayers continued to be read and studied 
by some biblical scholars. 

Gerstenberger’s monograph, Der bittende Mensch: Bittritual und Klagelied des 
Einzelnen im Alten Testament (1980),269 investigates the Sitz im Leben of the indi-
vidual laments in the book of Psalms. He reconstructs this partly by using shuil-
la-prayers and namburbi-rituals as analogies and postulates on the basis of this 
analogy  the  existence  of  ritual  specialists  in  Israel.  These  reconstructions  are 
quite plausible, though rather optimistic, as there is very little biblical evidence 
with which to work. 

A new approach is taken by Albertz in his Persönliche Frömmigkeit und offizi-
elle  Religion:  Religionsinterner Pluralismus  in  Israel  und  Babylon  (1978).270  In  this 
work Albertz first established the plurality within the religion of ancient Israel. 
He  distinguishes  between  different  social  strata  of  religion  and  tries  to  recon-
struct elements of private piety, which must  be differentiated from the official 
religion. Within this socially-differentiated framework, he classifies the  biblical 
psalms  of  individual  lament  as  deriving  from  the  domain  of  pre-exilic  private 
piety, whereas the Mesopotamian  incantation-prayers  originated in another  so-
cial  stratum  of  religion  because  of  their  complicated  ritual  contexts  and  their 
developed hymnic introductions. Albertz also discusses the concept of a “person-
al  god”  for both  Mesopotamia  and  Israel,  which  was first analyzed  by  Vorlän-
der.271 

In  the  last  third  of  the  twentieth  century,  Akkadian  prayers  were  used  in 
Hebrew Bible scholarship in a variety of approaches. For example, the enemies 
in the Biblical laments were explained as sorcerers in analogy to Mesopotamian 
ritual  texts.272  The  several  biblical  laments  of  the  individual  that  lament  Yah-

weh’s  absence273  and  the  change  of  mood  (“Stimmungsumschwung”)  near  the 
psalms’  conclusions  were  seen  to  have  Mesopotamian  analogies.274  Akkadian 
prayers were also used and cited when studying different literary and conceptual 
motifs.275 But the texts stood only rarely at the center of attention, as in the dis-
sertation by Lee, Gattungsvergleich der akkadischen Šu-ila-Gebete mit den biblischen 
Lobpsalmen (1996).276 

Despite the occasional attention, only in the last ten years has a renewed in-
terest in Akkadian prayers and their relevance for the study of the Hebrew Bible 
taken place. Following the methodological initiative of an article by Abusch,277 
Zgoll not only edited all extant shuilla-prayers addressed to Ishtar and fragments 
thereof, but also interpreted them as pieces of literature (2003).278 She also ana-
lyzed the function of the ritual setting of these prayers in several articles.279 The 
ritual  dimensions  and  the  problems  of  genre  are  also  the  main  topic  of  Fre-
chette’s dissertation, “The Name of the Ritual: Investigating Ancient Mesopota-
mian  ‘Hand-lifting’  Rituals  with  Implications  for  the  Study  of  Genre  in  the 
Psalms”  (2005).280  He  inquires  into  the meaning  of the  characteristic  subscrip-
tion of shuilla-prayers and discloses the problems of previous form-critical stud-
ies,  which  treated  the  ancient  subscription  as  modern  designations  of  genres 
without inquiring into their original significance. He demonstrates the flexibility 
of  shuilla-prayers,  which  were  recited  in  different  ritual  contexts.  Finally,  his

INTRODUCTION

interpretation of the “lifted-hand” as a central and reciprocal gesture converges 
with Zgoll’s analysis of the ritual as audience. 

A  very  different  approach  is  taken  by  Achenbach  in  two  related  articles 
(2004),  which  look  into  the  Sitz  im  Leben  of  both  Mesopotamian  and  Biblical 
prayers  of  different  genres  and  investigate  their  transmission,  collection,  and 
new contextualization within different rituals.281 

Lenzi (2010)282 and Zernecke (2009)283 take up anew the form-critical ques-
tion of Begrich’s “classical” paper. Via a different approach, both simultaneously 
arrived  at  the  conclusion  that  Begrich  is  right  in  his  analysis  that  the  relation 
between deity and supplicant is different in Akkadian shuilla-prayers and bibli-
cal  prayers  of  individual  lament.  But  this  does  not  indicate  that  the  trust  in 
Yahweh was generally greater in Israel than the trust in the deities in Mesopo-
tamia. Shuilla-prayers are not the appropriate analogy to biblical laments of the 
individual  in  terms  of  the  relation  between  god  and  man.  The  Mesopotamian 
dingirshadibba-prayers are structured like the biblical psalms of lament without 
hymnic  introduction,  but  they  also  comprise  addresses  demonstrating  a  close 
and  trustful  relationship.  Therefore,  both  authors  conclude  that  the  psalms  of 
individual  lament  are  addressed  to  Yahweh  as  the  personal  god  of  the  suppli-
cant,  just  as  dingirshadibba-prayers  are  addressed  to the personal god.  On  the 
other hand, shuilla-prayers speak to a high deity of the pantheon and mention 
the personal god and goddess only in passing. Zernecke arrives at this conclusion 
via a detailed study of particular texts, as the definition of genre is different in 
Assyriology  and  in  Hebrew  Bible  studies.  By  comparing  individual  texts,  the 
conclusions are necessarily limited in scope, but this enables her to analyze the 
different versions of single texts and their possible development over time. 

During the last one hundred years, Akkadian prayers have proven an inter-
esting and important parallel to the prayers transmitted within the canon of the 
Bible.  The  importance  of  the  Mesopotamian  texts  cannot  be  overemphasized. 
Since there are very few comparable texts from the Levant in Ugaritic or Arama-
ic  with  which  to  compare  the  biblical  prayers,  the  Akkadian  prayers  are  the 
closest  analogy  to  the  biblical  prayers  and  deserve  much  more  attention  than 
they have received up to now. Most Akkadian prayers are known from tablets of 
the first millennium BCE, spanning nearly the whole millennium; therefore, they 
can be considered more or less contemporary to biblical literature.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

As scholars who study the form of these texts are now paying more atten-
tion to their ritual setting and function as well as to the difference between the 
ancient  subscriptions  and  modern  form-critical  designations,  the  discussion  of 
form-critical  parallels  should  start  afresh.  Also,  the  question  of  ritual  settings 
and  the  different  contextualizations  of  Akkadian  prayers  could  be  more  inten-
sively discussed by biblical scholars. Most theories in the realm of literary criti-
cism, that is, reconstructing earlier stages of Biblical texts, are hypothetical. In 
this  point,  the  Akkadian  material  could  serve  as  an  important  parallel,  as  the 
texts are often transmitted on more than one tablet and with substantial differ-
ences.  The  poetic  form  of  both  Akkadian  and  biblical  prayers  is  often  similar, 
but comparative studies in this field are rare so far. The wealth of motives and 
concepts, of formulas and stock-phrases in both literatures also awaits a system-
atic analysis.  

All  of  these  prospective  approaches  are  dependent  on  the  future  develop-
ment of Assyriology. But the analysis of these texts holds out the promise of so-
lutions  for  several  old  problems  in  biblical  studies  and  the  development  of  a 
better understanding of what prayer and ritual meant in the ancient Near East, 
in  Mesopotamia  and  Israel,  and  how  these  cultures  conceived  the  relation  be-
tween deity and humanity.

An OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night 

JEFFREY L. COOLEY 

THE GODS OF THE NIGHT:  

The gods invoked in this prayer are not particularly distinguished in the OB 
period. Indeed,  other than Girra and  Erra, those listed are not well-attested as 
the focus of veneration, nor are they featured as principles in contemporary lit-
erature.1 Nevertheless, the Gods of the Night (ilū mušītim) do appear in several 
prayers  in  the  magical  ritual  Maqlû,  where  they  are  petitioned  for  protection 
against  disease,  black  magic,  and  ritual  impurity.2  A  more  elaborate  prayer  to 
night gods also for the purpose of preparing for an extispicy is known from the 
NA period as well (see Oppenheim), though there does not seem to be any ge-
netic relationship between it and the OB prayer treated here. Although there is 
modest overlap, the gods listed in our prayer, Maqlû, and the NA prayer are not 
the  same.  Thus,  the epithet  “Gods  of  the  Night”  is  by  no  means  a  formal  title 
associated with a fixed set of divinities. Rather, it is simply a descriptive rubric 
to refer to any divine grouping that is visible at night in astral form and which a 
particular text wishes to address en masse. 

The primary manifestations of most of the Gods of the Night appear to be 
specific stars and constellations, some of which we are able to identify with rea-
sonable certainty (see the notes below). On the other hand, Girra and Erra are 
gods  associated  with  fire  and plague  respectively  and  are  mostly  featured  out-
side of a celestial context in cult and literature. Girra is the god of fire and the 
hero  in  a  fragmentary  OB  myth.  In  that  myth,  Girra  slays  a  monster  named 
Elamatum, which is then transformed into a constellation.3 He is often equated 
with the god Gibil (one of Marduk’s fifty names in Enūma eliš VII 115), though 
the  two  deities  were  originally  separate.  Girra/Gibil plays a  significant role  in 
the magical defense against witchcraft, being one of the prime deities appealed 
 
1  A  possible  exception to this  is  mušḫuššu,  which  might  be  featured in  the fragmentary  Labbu 
Myth (see the comments to line 18).

to  in  the  series  Maqlû.  Erra  (who  is  often  associated  with  Nergal)  is  the  dark 
protagonist of  the first-millennium epic Erra and  Ishum,4 in which,  not coinci-
dentally,  celestial  divination plays  a major role.5  Girra  and  Erra  are  associated 
with celestial features in addition  to their primary mundane hypostases. While 
we do not know with what astral feature Girra is associated, Erra is later identi-
fied as a particular star, the Fox (MUL.KA5.A, Akk. šēlebum) in the Wagon constel-
lation  (MUL.MAR.GÍD.DA,  Akk.  ereqqum,  see  line  19  below),6  or  even  the  planet 
Mars (via his identification with the Fox star, which is also equated with Mars).7  

THE PRAYER:  

The prayer makes petition to these celestial deities for their participation in 
an extispicy ritual, during which a lamb was sacrificed and its exta were exam-
ined. It would have been recited by a diviner (bārû) in the evening that the sacri-
fice  took  place.  Such  mantic  acts  were  conceived  in  terms  of  a  trial,  with  the 
inquirer as the defendant and the gods as the judges. Thus, the terminology used 
in the prayer is, to a certain degree, legal in nature (e.g., lines 6 and 8: Šamaš 
Sîn Adad Ištar . . . ul idinnū dīnam ul iparrasū awātim “Shamash, Sin, Adad and 
Ishtar . . . do not render judgment, they do not decide a case,” and line 24, kit-
tam šuknān, “place truth!”).  

Though the patron gods of extispicy were Shamash and Adad (see pages 197 
and 85),  many of the major gods who dwelled in the sky were responsible  for 
the  legal  decision  to  be  made.8  According  to  the  prayer  (lines  6–7),  however, 
they are no longer present for the diviner to appeal to. The celestial deities here 
invoked are stars and constellations which, like the sun during the day, have a 
universal purview  of  the  cosmos  at  night.  They  are  not, however, the primary 
judges of the extispicy, but rather function in a mediating role between the peti-
tioning bārû, together with his client, and the high gods. Specifically, Steinkeller

Al-Rawi and J. Black, “The Second Tablet of ‘Išum and Erra,’” Iraq 51 (1989), 111–22. Recent 
translations of the myth include Stephanie Dalley, Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the Flood,

Czech Republic, Oriental Institute, 1998), and CAD Ṣ, 397. 
8  Adad,  as  a  weather  god,  is  located  in  the  sky.  Ishtar  and  Sin  are,  obviously,  Venus  and  the 
moon, respectively. The prayer seems to have been used, thus, on an evening when neither that 
planet nor the moon was visible.

argues, the stars act as personal advocates of the inquirer. While the high gods, 
primarily  Shamash  and  Adad,  are  ultimately  responsible  for  the  verdict  ren-
dered, the night gods nonetheless play a vital role for the inquirer who, by the 
very  choice  to  engage  in  such  a  mantic  act,  has  entered  the  courtroom  of  the 
most powerful judges in the cosmos. The inquirer desires a truthful and propi-
tious outcome and for this they need all the help they can muster. 

The prayer is logically divided into two sections. The first, lines 1–13, de-
scribe the situation: the city is buttoned up and the high gods are unavailable. 
Lines 14–24 form the second: the actual invocation of the Gods of the Night in 
which they are asked to stand at the ready so that they might assist in the ex-
tispicy. Line 25 is the rubric. 

The text of the prayer is quite well-preserved in two OB copies of unknown 
provenance. Variations  between these are relatively minor. This treatment fea-
tures the text discovered in 1924 but most recently published by Wayne Horo-
witz in 2000 (= MS A). The second copy (= MS B) was discovered and published 
by G. Dossin in 1935, shortly after MS A came to light.

Line 1: Pullulum (D of palālum), “to guard closely.” This form, like several of the verbs 
that follow, is a predicative. Predicative verbal constructions predominate in lines 1–4, and 
this underscores the inert state of the land as described in the text.  This first word of the 
prayer has been the subject of significant debate, but it is now generally agreed that this is 
the reading, though the form is admittedly unusual, in that the D stem of this root is oth-
erwise unattested (see A. Livingstone, NABU 1990, #86). Rubûm, “prince.” 
 
   
Line 2: Wašārum, “to sink, to let down.” Sikkūrum, “a locking bolt.” Šīrtum (šērtum), “a 
locking ring.” For this definition, see A. Livingstone, NABU 1990, #87. Šakānum, “to set, 
to  place.”  Note  also  that  šīrtum  is  a  homophone  of  šīrtum,  “morning.”  Perhaps  this  is  a 
deliberate word play on the author’s part? For this line, MS B has šikkātum šērētum tabkā, 
“the pegs, the locking rings are lying flat.”  
 
   
plural, nišū. Šaqummum, “silent,” an adj., is used here predicatively (3fp). 
 
   
Bābum, “gate, door.”  
 
   
Line  5:  Ilum,  “god.”  We  expect  ilū  (i.e.,  the  expected  nominative  construct/bound 
state) rather than ilī. For the genitive when we expect the nominative, see also mušītim in 
line 9 and ilī mušītim in line 14. Mātum, “land.” Ištartum, “goddess.” The proper name of 
the goddess, par excellence, is frequently used as a common noun to indicate female gods.  
 
   
gods Adad, Ea, Shamash, and Ishtar. 
 

wašrū sikkūrū šīrētum šaknā 
Line 3: Ḫabrum, “noisy, busy.” Nišum, “people,” usually occurs in the (irregular fem.) 

Line 6:  dUTU = Šamaš.  dEN.ZU = Sîn.  dIŠKUR  = Adad.  dINANA = Ištar.  MS B lists the 

Line  4:  Petûm,  “open,”  is  a  verbal  adj.  Uddulum  (D  of  edēlum),  “to  shut,  to  lock.”

Line  7:  Erēbum,  “to  enter.”  This  common  verb  takes  on  a  technical  meaning  when 
referring to a celestial body, such as the sun (i.e., Shamash), the moon, a planet, or star, 
namely, “to set.” Utlum, “lap” (utul is the construct/bound form). Šamû, “sky, heaven.” The 
word almost always occurs in the plural. Utul šamê refers to the sky’s interior that is not 
visible to humanity but in which the gods reside. See Wayne Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cos-
mic Geography (Mesopotamia Civilizations 8; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1998), 250–52 for 
discussion. 
 
   
Line 8: Ul, a particle of negation. Diānum (dânu), “to judge.” Dīnum, “judgment, deci-
sion.”  The idiom  dīnam  diānum  indicates a  variety  of  things, including  “to  (legally)  sen-
tence, to render a judgment.” Within the context of this prayer and within divination in 
general, this is the act of providing guidance through an oracle. As noted above, the gods’ 
guidance  in  mantic  practice  was  considered  the  rendering  of  a  binding  legal  decision. 
Parāsum, “to cut.” Awātum, “word, matter.” The idiom awātam parāsum is essentially syn-
onymous with dīnam diānum. 
 

ul idinnū dīnam ul iparrasū awātim 

īterbū ana utul šamê 

pussumat mušītim  

 
Line 9: Pussumum (D of pasāmum, with the same meaning as the G in the predicative), 
“to cover, to veil.” Mušītum, “night.” Mušītim is clearly the subject of the D fs predicative 
pussumat; however, it is in the genitive case and this might be a scribal error. MS B has mu-
ši-tum here. For the genitive when we expect the nominative, see also lines 5 and 14. 
 
   
Line 10: É.GAL = ēkallum, “palace.” Šaḫūrum, a kind of ritual building associated with 
a larger complex of buildings, is often translated simply as “chapel.” See CAD Š/1, 108–9. 
Kummum, “shrine, innermost sanctum, cella.” The term can refer both to a part of a struc-
ture and to a structure in its own right. See CAD K, 533–34. It is undoubtedly in the singu-
lar (no vowel length is indicated in the orthography, though the scribe does not consistent-
ly  indicate  this),  but  it  lacks  the  expected  mimation.  Adārum  “to  be  dark,  obscured”  (G 
3mp  predicative).  The  term  is  particularly  common  in  celestial  divination  literature  in 
which it can refer to the eclipse of the sun or moon, or the obscuration of a star or planet. 
See CAD A/1, 103–4 and note, in particular, the usage of adārum in the OB celestial omen 
text from the Hermitage (republished in the edition by Horowitz, 204, line 12). The idea 
might be that these religious structures, which are the seats of certain deities during the 
day are, in a sense, “eclipsed” during the night, when the night gods take over and their 
seats, i.e., the stars, etc., are visible.

Line 11: Alākum, “to walk, to go.” Urḫum, “path, road.” How would you translate the 
phrase ālik urḫi idiomatically? DINGIR = ilum, “god.” Šasûm, “to call, to shout, to invoke.” 
The scribe’s orthography here (i-ša-ši) is defective for the durative form. Instead of išassi, 
MS B has uselle (from sullûm), “he appeals to, prays to.” Ša dīnim, though often understood 
as  the  petitioner,  clearly  must  refer  to  the  petitioned  god,  i.e.,  dayyānum  ša  dīnim.  See 
Dossin’s translation of the same text in MS B: “le tribunal se rassasie de sommeil.” Šutebrûm 
(Št of bitrûm [Gt]) “to do permanently, to continue.” The origin of this common but unu-
sual root is difficult;  AHw derives it from  berûm,  “to starve.”  See AHw, 123 and CAD  B, 
279–81. Šittum, “sleep.” Here the accusative case is adverbial.  
 
   
Line  12:  Dayyānum,  “judge”  (dayyān  =  construct/bound  form).    Kittum  (from  kin-
tum*), “truth.” Abum, “father.” Ekūtum, “a destitute girl.” MS B repeats kittum at the end of 
the line, replacing ekūtum. The masculine equivalent of the term ekūtum does not occur. As 
such it often occurs in parallel with almattum, “widow.” See CAD E, 72–73. Here the epi-
thets dayyān kinātim and abi ekiātim are epithets of the sun god Shamash, mentioned by 
name in the next line. 

ālik urḫim ilam išassi u ša dīnim ušteberre šittam 

Šamaš īterub ana kummīšu 

dayyān kinātim abi ekiātim 
Line 13: Erēbum, see line 7. Shamash’s kummum here does not seem to be an area of 

   
an earthly shrine, but rather his own private cella in the celestial residence of the gods. 
 
   
Line 14: Line 14 begins a long sentence, whose main verb appears in line 21. Rabûm, 
“great.” The mp adjective here seems to be acting in apposition to ilī mušītim rather than 
serving as an attributive adjective. For ilī as a nominative, see comments to line 5 and 9. 
 
   
Line  15:  Nawrum,  “shining,  brilliant,”  is  a  common adj.  applied  to  celestial  bodies. 
dBIL.GI = Girra. As mentioned in the introduction, the fire god Girra is the protagonist in 
the  poorly  preserved  OB  myth  called  Girra and  Elamatum,  in  which  he  slays a  monster 
called Elamatum and makes her into a constellation. In this context, it is important to note 
that  the  constellation  Elamatum  appears in  MS  B  after  qaštum  (MS  A  line  17)  and  in  the 
place of nīrum. Ms B thus features both the protagonist and adversary of the OB myth.

Line 16: Qurādum, “warrior, hero.” A common epithet for gods, qurādum is also ap-

qaštum nīrum 

   
Line 17: Qaštum, “bow.” Here qaštum refers to the Bow constellation, probably part of 
Canis Major (Reiner and Pingree, 11; Gössmann, #47). This constellation features promi-
nently in Enūma eliš as Marduk’s prized weapon, which is installed in the sky and adopted 
by Anu as his own daughter (VI 82–91). That passage is a rare example of catasterism in 
Mesopotamian literature. (See also Astrolabe B B1:14–16 [KAV 218] and MUL.APIN I ii 7.) 
Nīrum, “yoke.” Otherwise written logographically as ŠUDUN. Nīrum is possibly to be identi-
fied as the constellation Boötes (Reiner and Pingree, 15; Gössmann, #379). 
 
   
Line  18:  MS  B  begins  the  line  with  zappum,  literally,  “a  bristle  of  hair,”  but  here a 
name  for  the  Pleiades  (normally  written  MUL.MUL;  Reiner  and  Pingree,  13;  Gössmann, 
#171 and #279) Šitadarrum, “Orion.”  Note also the by-forms šitadallum and šidallum,  as 
well as the common Sumerian orthography SIPA.ZI.AN.NA (“the true shepherd of heaven”). 
The origin and meaning of the Akkadian name is unclear, though Gössmann suggests it is 
derived from the verb šadālum, “to be wide,” and means something like “the wide man, 
the giant” (Reiner and Pingree, 14; Gössmann, #348). Mušḫuššum, “furious serpent.” This 
constellation is only attested in the OB period. It might be the dragon whose origin is de-
scribed  in  the  Labbu  Myth  (Frans  Wiggermann,  “Tišpak,  his  Seal,  and  the  Dragon 
Mušhuššu,” in To the Euphrates and Beyond: Archaeological Studies in Honor of Mauits N. van 
Loon [ed. O. Haex et al; Rotterdam: A. A. Balkema, 1989], 117–33, esp. 126). Gössmann 
equates it with the later constellation MUŠ, though this is by no means certain; if it is the 
case,  however,  it  is  possibly  to  be  identified  with  the  constellation  Hydra  (Reiner  and 
Pingree, 13; Gössmann, #284).  
 
    
Line 19:  GIŠ.MAR.GÍD.DA  =  ereqqum, “wagon, cart,” is a constellation  roughly  corre-
sponding to our Ursa Major (Reiner and Pingree, 13; Gössmann, #258). Enzum, “goat,” is 
often,  though  not  here,  written  logographically  ÙZ.  It  is  perhaps  the  constellation  Lyra 
(Reiner and Pingree, 16; Gössmann #145). 

šitaddarum mušḫuššum 

ereqqum enzum 

    
Line 20: Kusarikkum, “bison.” The bison is depicted as a wild monster in Mesopotami-
an conflict mythology, such as Enūma eliš I 143 (see the discussion of monster lists in W. G.

12.7.1985 [ed. K. Hecker and W. Sommerfeld; Berlin: Dietrich Reimer, 1986], 55–59). In 
these mythological contexts, however, there  is  no need to identify  kusarrikkum with this 
astral  manifestation.  Bašmum,  “horned  serpent.”  This  unidentified  constellation  is  only 
attested in the OB period. Though Gössmann (#51) suggested that this be identified as the 
constellation Hydra, his proposal is merely a stab in the dark. A bašmum is also featured as 
one of the monsters created by Tiamat in Enūma eliš (I 141). In addition to their literary 
attestations, these two monsters appear together in Šurpu VIII 6–7 (see Erica Reiner, Šurpu: 
A Collection of Sumerian and Akkadian Incantations [AfO Beiheft 11; Graz, 1958], 39). MS B 
omits bašmum but adds ilū mušītim rabītim, “gods of the great night.” 
 
    
Line 21: Izuzzum/uzuzzum, “to stand, to make an appearance.” The form is a G 3mp 
precative.  This  root  in  the  precative  is  quite  common  in  prayers  which  request  a  god’s 
presence. The scribe mistakenly omitted a ZU sign. MS B has the cp impv. izizzānim here, 
thus  keeping  the  person  by  which  the  supplicant  addresses  the  deities  consistent.  See 
comment on line 24 below. The enclitic –ma is attached to a volitive/injunctive form and 
is  followed  by  another  volitive/injunctive  form,  i.e.,  šuknān  in  line  23.  Thus,  a  simple 
“and”  will  not  suffice  in  a  translation.  It  needs  to  be  rendered  as  indicating  a  purpose 
clause (“so that, in order that”). 
 
    
Line 22:  Têrtum, “extispicy.” The term refers broadly to a report or instruction. But 
within  this  context  it  is  a  technical  term  referring  to  this  particular  act  of  divination. 
Epēšum,  “to  do,  to  make.”  The  verb  has  the  subordinating/subjunctive  marker  –u.  The 
relative clause is, in this case, not marked by ša. In such unmarked clauses the antecedent 
is in the bound/construct state, as is têrti here (see also line 23). Têrtam epēšum is an idiom 
meaning, “to perform an extispicy.” 
 
    
Line 23: Puḫādum, “lamb.” The word is in the bound/construct state, since it precedes 
an unmarked relative clause. MS B has ikribi, “offering.” Karābum, “to offer.” Note again the 
subordinating/subjunctive marker –u.  
 
    
Line 24: Kittum, “truth, justice.” Šakānum, “to place” (cp impv. plus what seems to be 
a shortened form of the 1cs dative object [= ventive suffix –nim]). Note that between the 
first verb in the sequence, lizzizū-ma (in line 21), and this verb, the author has changed the 
person in which the gods are addressed from third person to second. Just as “the locking

MU.BI = šumūšu. MS B omits MU.BI. This term is often found in colophons giving a summary 
of the number of lines in the text. Ikribu, “prayer.” The scribe has mistakenly omitted a RI

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
Extispicy is quite well-attested in the Late Bronze Levant, both in the north 
(i.e., Ugarit) and the south (Hazor) in the form of Babylonian-style liver models.1 
Despite the ample Late Bronze evidence, however, there is no clear evidence for 
the practice in Iron Age Israel or Judah. This is not particularly surprising since 
the  Akkadian  Late  Bronze  hepatoscopic texts  outside  of  Mesopotamia,  and  the 
non-Akkadian  ones  they  inspired  at  Ugarit,  are  the  result  of  the  international 
exportation of Babylonian scholarship that went hand-in-hand with the Babylo-
nian cultural koiné of the Late Bronze Age. When that international use and ap-
preciation  of  Babylonian  knowledge  ended  in  the  tumult  of  the  thirteenth  to 
twelfth centuries, the mantic exports, in many ways the pinnacle of what would 
become  ummânūtu  (expertise  in  the  scribal  craft),  ceased  as  well.  Thus,  Ezek 
21:26 is the only  mention of the practice in  indisputable terms in  the Hebrew 
Bible. In this case, the prophet is referring to the decision-making of the Babylo-
nian  monarch  Nebuchadnezzar  II,  as  he  plots  his  military  strategy  during  his 
conquest of Canaan. The king “looked at the liver” (
) in addition to per-
forming an act of belomancy (divination using arrowheads) and consulting tera-
phim. In the prophet’s presentation, Yahweh has guided the results of the mantic 
acts so as to lead the king to conquer Jerusalem. Though Yahweh directs these 
undertakings,  his presence in  them is  described  as  something  exceptional—the 
 
1  Twenty-two  models  of  exta,  including  the  inscribed  liver  models  (KTU  1.141,  1.142,  1.143, 
1.144, 1.155, and an inscribed lung model, 1.127) have been uncovered at Ugarit (see M. Die-
trich and O. Loretz et al., Mantik in Ugarit: Keilalphabetische Texte der Opferschau, Omensammlun-
gen, Nekromantie [ALASP 3; Münster: Ugarit Verlag, 1990], 5–38) while three inscribed and three 
uninscribed fragmentary liver models dating to roughly the Old Babylonian/Middle Babylonian 
periods  have  been  discovered  at  Hazor  (W.  Horowitz  et  al.,  Cuneiform  in  Canaan:  Cuneiform 
Sources  from  the  Land  of  Israel  in  Ancient  Times  [Jerusalem:  Israel  Exploration  Society/Hebrew 
University, 2006], 66–68 and Wayne Horowitz, et al, “Hazor 17: Another Clay Liver Model,” IEJ

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Judahites, the prophet tells us, believe the results  of Nebuchadnezzar’s divina-
tions are false by their very nature (Ezek 21:28). 
 
Despite  the  lack  of  Iron  Age  archaeological  evidence  and  textual  witness, 
several scholars have argued that  extispicy was practiced in ancient Israel and 
Judah. Sigmund Mowinckel claims that certain Psalms were, in fact, oracle ques-
tions posed to Yahweh before the ritual slaughter of an animal whose exta were 
to  be  examined.2  Specifically,  based  on  its  usage  in  2  Kgs  16:15  and  Ps  5:4, 
Mowinckel makes the case that the verb רקב (normally translated “to inquire”) is 
a technical term referring to performing an extispicy.3 Otto Loretz, building on 
Mowinckel’s study and citing the liver models from Ugarit as precedent, posits 
that the “signs,” תוֹתֹא, mentioned in Ps 74:4, 9 are, in fact, liver omina.4 Freder-
ick  Cryer,  looking  at  the  time,  location,  equipment,  procedure,  language,  and 
personnel described in the various descriptions of (condoned) divination in the 
Hebrew  Bible,  maintains  that  these  accounts  are  modeled  on  NA  extispicy  re-
ports and queries and implies that, under the heavily edited biblical narratives 
which  report  them,  lies  buried  the  remains  of  an  Israelite  hepatoscopic  tradi-
tion.5  Anne  Jeffers  considers  whether  the  participle  ד ֵקֹנ,  “sheep-tender”  (used 
only  twice  in  the  Hebrew  Bible,  2  Kgs  3:4  and  Amos  1:1),  might  refer  to  one 
who  not  only  raises  sheep,  but  was  actually  involved  in  sacrifice  and  mantic 
liver examination.6 

All of these proposals share certain elementary problems. Why are there no 
models of exta known from Iron Age sites in Israel and Judah, though they are 
attested in the Late Bronze Age? Why, if the biblical authors use specific tech-
nical terminology to refer to hepatoscopy (i.e.,  רקב and  ד ֵקֹנ, as per Mowinckel, 
Loretz  and  Jeffers) do they not employ that terminology when referring to the 
practice in Ezek 21:26? Even if it is because they reject the foreign, but not do-
mestic,  practice  of  extispicy,  the  biblical  authors  are  perfectly  willing  to  call 
other illegitimate diviners by native technical terms (e.g., prophets of other dei-
ties: 1 Kgs 18:19; 2 Kgs 10:19; Jer 2:8; 23:13; false prophets of Yahweh: 1 Kgs

Investigation (JSOTSup 142; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1994), 298–305. Notably, while Cryer astutely 
rejects the methods  of Mowinckel  (296) and  Loretz (296–98), he  accepts their conclusion that 
extispicy  was  known  and  practiced  in  ancient  Israel.  The  fundamental  problem  with  Cryer’s 
argument  is that  all  mantic  acts include  the  elements  named  above  to  a  high  degree  since  all 
divinatory acts are rituals conducted by special personnel, which respond in time and place to 
specific  situations!  Celestial  divination,  for  example,  for  which  we  also  have  extensive  reports 
dating to the NA period, mention all, some, or many of these elements. This does not mean that 
the biblical narrative, and ultimately the real practice which lies behind it, is based on Babyloni-
an or native Israelite celestial divination.

22:6). Why the unwillingness in this case? Why, if hepatoscopy was practiced in 
Israel and Judah, only later to be condemned and its overt mention eradicated 
from  the  biblical  text,  is  it  not  mentioned  in  the  list  of  prohibited  diviners  in 
Deut 18:10–11? Ultimately, all arguments in favor of Israelite and Judahite ex-
tispicy are highly speculative. 

Functionally speaking, we are also at a loss to find biblical parallels for this 
prayer.  While  there  are  several  acceptable  means  of  divination  in  the  biblical 
tradition, i.e., prophecy, cleromancy, oneiromancy (see 1 Sam 28:6), and quite a 
few forbidden ones (Deut 18:10–11), we have no Israelite or Judahite preparato-
ry prayers made for these acts, other than the specific questions posited (e.g., 1 
Sam 30:8; 1 Kgs 22:6; and perhaps Psalms 4,  60, 108, 119 and 143). The He-
brew  Bible  contains  narrative  descriptions  of  divination  and  often  its  results—
but it is not a diviner’s manual  and contains no traces of one. One  wonders if 
any mantic technical literature (e.g., lists of dream omens or rules for lots), other 
than the results of prophecy, was ever committed to writing in Israel and Judah 
or if the divinatory traditions were ultimately and exclusively oral.  

The thrust of the prayer is a plea for an accurate, truthful extispicy, guided 
by  the  gods.  And,  though  we  have  no  divinatory  manuals  from  ancient  Israel, 
within the Hebrew Bible we can observe a certain amount of anxiety regarding 
the truthfulness of an oracle. According to Deut 18:21–22, a prophet of Yahweh 
can only be judged legitimate if the oracles he delivers come to fruition. When 
making a decision, of course, it is not much good to know after the fact whether 
the oracle relays the truth. Thus, in 1 Kgs 22, the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat, 
asks  for  a  second  prophetic opinion  regarding  the  joint Judahite-Israelite mili-
tary expedition against Ramoth-Gilead. When the prophet Micaiah ben Imlah is 
summoned, his initial oracle confirms the previous one offered unanimously by 
four-hundred prophets.  But  the  king  of  Israel  is  incredulous  and  demands  that 
the prophet offer him the truth in Yahweh’s name (1 Kgs 22:16, 
). 
The truthful oracle is decidedly negative and the vision of Yahweh’s court that 
the lone prophet recounts indicates that the deity was, in fact, guiding the oracle 
of the four-hundred prophets—but not with the truth! Instead, Yahweh deliber-
ately misled the kings by dispatching a “false spirit” (
, 1 Kgs 22:22–23). 
Though theologically upsetting to many ancient and modern readers, 1 Kgs 22 
sheds light on our prayer by revealing that the plea for a truthful extispicy might 
not merely be a plea for divine mediation and accuracy in the extispicy proce-
dure, but also a plea for the gods to be honest in guiding their servants!

While there are no real functional parallels in the Hebrew Bible, the concept 
that an oracle was a legal decision does have some analogies. It has been noted 
since at least the days of Gunkel and Begrich that certain oracles are framed as 
lawsuits, i.e., the so-called Gerichtsrede (“Judgment Speech/Oracle”).7 As stated 
above, in the Prayer to the Gods of the Night the night gods serve as an advocate

of the inquirer. In  the biblical  Judgment Oracle, it is the prophet himself who 
acts as a mediator, but in these cases he is representing the plaintiff, i.e., Yah-
weh (e.g., Isa 1:2–20; Mic 6:1–8), and the cosmos acts as witness.8 Such oracles, 
like our prayer, employ legal terminology and concepts, such as “lawsuit” (Mic 
6:1, בי ִר) and the calling of witnesses, “Listen, O Sky, and pay attention, O Earth, 
for  Yahweh  hereby  speaks!”  (Isa  1:2a, 
).  While 
this  is  hardly  a  profound  correlation,  it  demonstrates  that,  unsurprisingly,  in 
both our prayer and certain biblical pericopes the writers conceived of the invis-
ible administration of divine-human relationships in mundane legal terms with 
which they were quite familiar.

An OB Ikribu-Like Prayer to Shamash and Adad 

ALAN LENZI 

SHAMASH:  

See page 197. 

ADAD: 

 
Adad (also, Ḫaddu, Ḫadda, Addu, Adda) is the Semitic name of the ancient 
Near Eastern storm god par excellence who was responsible for storms, thunder, 
lightning, wind, and rain. Worship of this god extended across the entire ancient 
Near East under various other names, such as Ishkur (Sum.), Teshub (Hurrian), 
Baʿlu  (Ugaritic),  and  Taru/Tarḫun(t)  (Hattic/Hittite-Luwian).  In  Mesopotamian 
traditions,  he  was  the  son  of  Anu  or  sometimes  Enlil,  his  consort  was  Shala 
(identified  with  Sum.  Medimsha),  and  his  ministers  were  Shullat  and  Ḫanish. 
Iconographically,  Adad  was  represented  by  a  lion-dragon  in  third  millennium 
sources and a bull by OB times. In anthropomorphic depictions, he is frequently 
found holding a weapon or a lightning bolt, as if ready to strike an opponent in 
battle. Although his name is usually written with the logogram IŠKUR, a sign that 
can be read as the Sumerian word im, “wind,” one also finds it written syllabi-
cally in Akkadian and sometimes logographically as d10. 

Adad was syncretized to the Sumerian storm god Ishkur during the Sargonic 
and Ur III periods (i.e., the late third millennium) and became a major power in 
the  Mesopotamian  pantheon  by  OB  times.  His  shrines  and  temples  were  quite 
numerous throughout Mesopotamia, Syria (e.g., at Ebla, Mari, Emar, Ḫalab, and 
Ugarit), and beyond, extending chronologically from Early Dynastic to Hellenis-
tic times. Prominent examples of sanctuaries include the double Anu-Adad tem-
ple in Ashur, dating back to the reign of Shamshi-Adad I, and Adad’s most im-
portant  Babylonian  shrine—according  to  first  millennium  sources—located  at 
Zabban (90km east of the Tigris and 175km southeast of Ashur). 

Given Adad’s sphere of power, it can be no surprise that he was both pro-
ductive  and  destructive  to  humans,  bringing  abundance,  on  the  one  hand,  via

rain that watered crops and animals (see, e.g., Atram-ḫasīs II i 11–16, 30–33),1 
and wreaking devastation, on the  other,  with powerful storms and floods (see, 
e.g.,  Atram-ḫasīs  III  ii  48–55).2  Due  to  the  latter  association,  Adad  was  an  im-
portant war god, especially evident among Middle and Neo-Assyrian sources. 
 
Along with his role as a storm god, Adad was also a guardian of oaths. In 
Sippar, for example, he was closely associated with Shamash, who together with 
Adad  was  invoked  to  bear  witness  to  legal  cases  and  contracts.  This  must  be 
significant  for  their  association  in  divinatory  texts,  attested  as  early  as  OB 
times.3 
 
To  explain  Adad’s  rather  unexpected  role  in  oracular  divination,  Daniel 
Schwemer offers two suggestions. First, Adad “was a celestial god who . . . had 
power over numerous ominous phenomena and dwelled in immediate proximity 
to  the  celestial  sun-god.”  And  second,  he  “was  lord  of  the  winds,  which  were 
seen  in  Mesopotamia  as  the  divine  carriers,”4  perhaps  thereby  providing  the 
means to communicate the extispicy verdict to the human diviner.5  

 

THE PRAYER:  

 
This OB prayer was used in the diviner’s extispicy ritual to petition the high 
gods in charge of the oracular decision: Shamash and Adad. (It is closely associ-
ated with the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night, see page 71). After the diviner 
had gathered the gods via this prayer and made them amenable to hear inquir-
ies, the diviner may have made his inquiry in the form of a tamitu-prayer (see 
page 465). In order to learn the answer to his inquiry, the diviner would exam-
ine the animal sacrificed  in the extispicy and read the signs that the gods had 
placed in its exta. In this way, the diviner could learn the will of the gods in the 
matter about which he had inquired.  

The prayer falls into two main parts. In the first ten lines the diviner under-
takes his ritual purification.6 In the remainder of the text (lines 11–66), the di-
viner  performs  six  more  ritual  actions,  directed  at  Shamash  alone,  and  asks 
Shamash,7 sometimes including Adad, eight times in the course of the prayer to

7  Shamash is mentioned seventeen times in the text: 1, 11, 14, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 34, 36, 42, 44, 
50, 51, 54, 55, and 58. Adad is mentioned only six times: lines 11, 27, 36, 44, 51, 55, always in 
tandem with  an invocation  of  Shamash. Only  Shamash is  invoked at  the  beginning  of  each of 
seven ritual actions described in the text (see lines 1, 14, 19, 25, 34, 42, 50; and Starr, 46).

“place the truth” (kittam šuknam) in the extispicy offering (see lines 13, 18, 33, 
41, 49, 53, 57, 66; see also the OB prayer to the Gods of the Night, line 24 [see 
page 78]). In other words, the diviner asks the deity to answer his oracular ques-
tion with a firm reply via the placing of a sign in the exta of the animal being 
sacrificed (see YOS 11 23:16).8   

The preparations mentioned in lines 1–10 apparently form a rite of purifica-
tion (see line 9), making the diviner worthy to approach the place of extispicy, 
the  place  to  which  the  gods  are  summoned.9  Cedar  plays  a  major  role  in  this 
process of purification but the precise significance of its various uses is not at all 
clear. One assumes the aromatic qualities of cedar or cedar resin figure into the 
process somehow.  
 
The remainder of the prayer is highly repetitive, but its presentation shows 
a very clear logic. Lines 11–66 describe the ritual preparations of a meal for the 
gods (see Starr, 57): incense makes the air pleasant to smell,10 water is offered 
for washing the hands, food is laid out, and the guests are announced.11 After the 
initial preparation (incense and water, lines 11–24), the gods are to come to the 
table, eat, sit on thrones, and render a  judgment (see lines 29–30, 38–39, and 
45b–48a). In  or during their meal the gods, now present and happily  sated by 
their repast, were requested to leave a sign in the sacrificed animal in response 
to the diviner’s oracular inquiry, perhaps asked after this prayer in the form of a 
tamitu-prayer. The diviner would then find and interpret the sign in the animal’s 
exta to learn the gods’ decision. 
The present prayer is similar to the ikribu-prayers discussed in the general 
 
introduction (see page 46), even being included among a list of such prayers by 
Mayer  (UFBG,  32,  n.63).  Yet  it  is  not  an  ikribu-prayer,  properly  speaking.  As 
Starr writes:  

The OB Prayer . . . deviates in form from the standard ikribu. It does not begin 
with the opening formula . . . , but with a vivid description of how the diviner 
uses cedar (resin, most likely) for purposes of cultic purification, and the whole 
ritual (lines 1–10) is addressed to Šamaš alone. Only the second unit (line 11ff.)

opens  with the introductory  formula  of the  ikribus. Here too, the text deviates 
from  the  latter  by  placing  the  closing  formula  (ina  ikrib  akarrabu,  etc.)  imme-
diately after the opening formula (line 12). In short, while the OB Prayer is con-
structed along the lines of an ikribu, employing identical formulas and describing 
a set of activities of the diviner, it bears neither the title ikribu, nor does it em-
ploy the (opening and closing) formulas in the orthodox manner. . . . From this 
we should draw the conclusion that not all prayers of the diviner are ikribus, alt-
hough they may appear to be so.12

Line 1: UTU = Šamaš, the sun god. Notice the brief invocation. The diviner regularly 
came  before  Shamash  and  Adad  during  extispicies.  Perhaps  this  familiarity  explains  the 
lack of an elaborate hymnic introduction (salutation). Alternatively, one could suggest that 
ritual acts (and their description in the prayer) serve as the introductory motif. The diviner 
shows himself to be ritually prepared to meet with the gods of divination. Šakānum, “to 
place,  to  put.”  Ana,  “to,  for.”  Pûm,  “mouth.”  GIŠ.EREN  =  erēnum,  “cedar.”  It  is  unclear

whether the diviner put the actual cedar wood or only cedar resin in his mouth (see CAD 
E, 279 for this general ambiguity). Ellum, “pure, clear.” 
 
   
Line  2:  Goetze  read  the  first  word  as  a-ṣa-ni-ip-ku,  but  there  is  no  known  root 
*ṣanāpum in Akkadian. As others have since recognized, the verb is sanābum (or sanāpum), 
“to tie” (see CAD S, 132–33). The pronominal suffix on the verb is a 2ms dative without 
mimation, as also in lines 8 and 54 (compare line 3). Ina, “in, on, by, from, with.” Itqum, 
“fleece, tuft, lock (of hair).” Pērtum (pirtum), “hair (of head).” According to CAD P, 415, 
itiq pērtim means “forelock,” which refers to the hair that covers one’s forehead. The object 
of the verb must be implied from context (see lines 1 and 7). It is not clear what exactly 
the diviner is doing with his hair. Is he tying a piece of cedar into his hair or is he using a 
piece of his hair as a binding? 
 
asannibku ina itiq pērtīya  
   
Line 3: The verb from line 1 is repeated here, but this time it has the 2ms pronominal 
suffix  (with  mimation).  The  text’s  a-ša-ka-an-ku-um  is  a  morphographemic  writing  since 
the  final  radical  of  the  root,  n,  would  have  assimilated  to  the  following  consonant  in 
speech (–nk– becomes –kk–). Sūnum, “lap, loin.” 
 
   
Line 4: The meaning of šabium (šabû) is unknown. Goetze translates it as “compact” 
(with a note on 27–28) while Foster renders it “bushy,” but the lexica do not even attempt 
a gloss. It seems to describe cedar somehow, either as a substantive in construct, a preced-
ing adjective, or an appositive. See CAD Š/1, 17 for a brief discussion. In any case, this line 
provides the object of the verb in line 3.  
 
   
Line 5: Mesûm, “to wash, to purify.” U, “and.” Qātum, “hand.” Notice the verbs in this 
line and the next two have changed to preterites (from the previous duratives). These may 
indicate that the diviner purified himself before the prayer in preparation to meet with the 
gods. Washing the hands and mouth as a ritual preparation is found relatively frequently 
in  the  Mesopotamian  ritual  materials.  One  did  not  want  to  offend  the  gods  with  filthy 
hands and bad breath (see van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction, 33–34).

Line 7: See lines 1 and 2. How the action here relates to the action of line 2 is un-
clear. Does the diviner repeat in line 2 during the prayer the action that he had already 
done prior to speaking it (recounted here)? 
 
   
Line 8: Goetze read the first word as al-ta-ba-ak-ku but this did not supply adequate 
sense. As Seux notes (467), Erica Reiner suggested the present reading, deriving the verb 
from šapākum, “to heap up, to pile, to pour on.” The form is a 1cs perfect. Again, we see 
the 2ms dative pronominal suffix without mimation. 
 

asnib erēnam ellam ina itiq pērtīya  

altappakku šabiam erēnam 

ellēku ana puḫur ilī eṭeḫḫi 

 
Line  9:  The  form  of  ellum  is  a  1cs  predicative.  Puḫrum,  “assembly.”  Ilum,  “god.” 
Ṭeḫûm, “to approach, to be(come) near to.” It is unclear whether the prepositional phrase 
in this line should be read with the first or the second verb, but the meaning, on either 
reading,  is  very  similar.  Having  completed  his  preparations,  the  diviner  is  in  a  state  of 
purity.  He  may  now  approach  the  divine  assembly  for  their  decision  (see  line  10).  The 
prayer is performative in that his speaking it initiates his approach. 
 
   
Line 10: Dīnum, “decision, judgment.” The diviner purifies himself and ritually enters 
the  divine  assembly  to  obtain  their  decision  with  regard  to  his  inquiry.  The  answer,  of 
course, is delivered via extispicy. 
 
   
Line 11: The diviner renews the invocation but now includes Adad (=  dIŠKUR) with 
Shamash. Bēlum, “lord.” Ikribum generally means “prayer, blessing,” but see the next line. 
The word is best taken here as a plural. Bīrum, “divination” (both the act of extispicy and 
the answer received). Goetze (25) suggests the missing mimation on this final word of the 
line is due to the lack of space on the tablet. This is the only instance where it is missing 
(see otherwise lines 27, 37, 45, 52, and 56). The epithets bēl  dīnim and bēl bīrim are ap-
plied  to  Shamash  and  Adad  a  millennium  later  in  the  SB  tamitu-prayers  (see  Lambert, 
Babylonian Oracle Questions and page 465 in this book) and ikribu-prayers (see Zimmern, 
BBR, nos. 75–101 [pp. 190–219]).

Line  12:  Karābum,  “to  pray,  to  bless,  to  greet,”  generally,  but  with  its  cognate, 
ikribum, the idiom means “to utter a prayer, a blessing,” and probably refers here to “the 
ritual-cum-prayer  part,  i.e.,  the  various  cultic  activities  and  prayers  associated  with  the 
ritual  of  the  diviner,  which are  usually  described in  the  subscript  to  each  ikribu”  (Starr, 
50). Têrtum, “message, instruction, omen, extispicy.” The gods make their will known via 
the têrtum that they place on the exta of the sheep. With the verb epēšum, “to do, to make,” 
the idiom means “to perform an extispicy” (Starr, 50). In both phrases that comprise our 
line, we do not simply have a verb and its object. Rather, we have a prepositional phrase 
whose  substantive  is  the  object  of  the  verb  to  which  it  is  bound  (thereby  forming  brief 
relative clauses): “in the X, which I do.” This explains the subjunctive –u on both verbs. 
 
   
Line 13: Kittum, “truth.” Šuknam is the ms imperative of šakānum with a ventive. This 
statement,  which  appears  numerous  times  throughout  the  prayer,  is  “an  appeal  for  the 
manifestation of the oracular verdict” (Starr, 58).  
 
   
Line 14: Qutrēnum (qutrīnum, qutrinnum), “incense.” Pî qutrēnim is obscure, though it 
may refer to the opening of the flask containing incense (see Seux, 468, n.10). Foster takes 
qutrēnim  as the  object  of the  verb.  But  this understanding  must assume a mistaken  case 
vowel on qutrēnim. In any case, the diviner again invokes Shamash and places pure cedar 
(see line 15) “to the mouth” of something, as in line 1. 
 
   
Line 15:  The restoration in this line follows CAD Q, 324.  Ša,  “which,” introduces a 
brief relative clause that further describes the pî qutrēnim in line 14. Maḫrīka, “before you, 
in front of you.” Erēnam ellam is the direct object of the verb in line 14. (W)ašābum, “to sit, 
to  dwell,  to  reside.”  When  used  with  smoke-like  things,  “linger”  seems  an  appropriate 
translation of the verb (see Goetze, 26 and Foster, 209). Goetze suggests the missing mi-
mation on the final noun is simply due to the lack of space on the tablet (see 25).

Šamaš ašakkan ana pî qutrēnim

Line 16: Qerûm, “to call, to invite.” The ventive on the precative indicates the diviner 
wishes to summon the gods to his present location. The subject of the verb should be un-
derstood as the incense mentioned in the previous line. As Goetze has written, “[t]he fra-
grance of  the  burned cedar is supposed to stay for a while and  to bring the gods to the

Lines 17–18: See lines 12–13. 
ina ikrib akarrabu ina têrti ēpušu  
kittam šuknam 

    
Line 19: The invocation is renewed yet again, though only to Shamash. Našûm, “to lift 
up, to raise.” Goetze reads the text as if the verb were a durative with a 2ms dative pro-
nominal suffix, anaššīkum. But the copy (YOS 11 22:19) does not show an initial A. Before 
positing a scribal omission, one should note that the same orthography appears in lines 25, 
34, 42, and 50 (thus the understanding of the same verb in line 25 by CAD L, 206, <a>-
na-ši-ku-um, is atomistic and unlikely; see a different solution in CAD P, 408 on line 42). As 
Goetze has suggested for line 25, na-ši-ku-um stands here for našiākkum, an apocopated 1cs 
predicative with 2ms dative suffix. In support of this, he writes, “[t]he corresponding form 
with  plural  suffix  na-ši-a-ku-nu-ši-im  is  actually  found  in  AO  7032  (RA  38  87  [see  now 
Starr, 122:2]) and from there to be restored in YBT XI 2 obv.2” [=YOS 11 2:2, for which 
see Starr, 30:2] (29). Even if Goetze is correct, we do not know why the scribe used this 
odd  orthography  in all  four  instances  of  the  verb in  this  text.  Mû  (always  pl.),  “water.” 
ÍD.IDIGNA = Idiqlat, “Tigris.” ÍD.BURANUN(UD-KIB-NUN)-NA = Purattum, “Euphrates.” 
 
    
Line  20:  The  relative  ša  refers  back  to  mê  in  line  19.  Ištu,  “from,  out  of.”  Šadûm, 
“mountain(s).” GIŠ.ŠU.ÚR.MÌN = šurmēnum, “cypress.” Goetze’s GIŠ.SU-ÚR-MÌN in the text (26) 
is corrected in the notes (29). Cedar and cypress occur together frequently in rituals of the 
diviner (see Goetze, 29).  
 
    
Line 21:  Kâšim  is  the 2ms independent  dative  pronoun,  “to,  for  you.”  Babālum,  “to 
carry, to bring.” The verb is a transitive parsāku form—identical in appearance to the pre-
dicative;  cedar and  cypress  (from  line 20) are  its  direct  objects.  It  ends  the  subordinate 
clause begun with the ša in line 20. Mutassûm (Dt of mesûm), “to wash oneself.” Mutissi is a 
ms imperative. Qurādum, “hero, warrior.” The washing here and in the next couple of lines 
is in preparation for eating the sacrificial meal that the diviner lays out before the gods.

IR.MEŠ = ilū, “gods.”  
 
    
Line 23:  Attā, “you” (ms). Mutissi in line 21 is the same verb form  as  mutessi here. 
Bunene is the chief minister (and sometimes son) of Shamash (see Goetze, 29, citing Zim-
mern,  BBR  1–20,  line 105 [p. 102]: Bunene sukkal Šamaš  u Aya, “Bunene, vizier  of Sha-
mash and Aya”). Našparum, “messenger, envoy.” The form of the noun is due to the fact 
that the word is bound to kittim in the following line.  
 
    
Line 24: Although kittum means “truth,” its being bound to a preceding noun (našpar 
in  line  23)  as  it  is  here  might  be  better  rendered  in  English  with  an  adj.  preceding  the 
translation of našpar. Thus, instead of the literalistic “messenger of truth,” one might trans-
late the construction as “reliable messenger.” Maḫar is the bound form of maḫrum used in 
line 15. Bunene is to wash himself in front of Shamash. Dayyānum, “judge.” Shamash’s role 
as  judge  is  quite  typical.  He  decides  the  case  put  before  the  gods  in the  form  of an  ex-
tispicy. 
 
    
Line 25: For the verb na-ši-ku-um, see line 19. Liqtum, “gathered material, selection, a 
quality item, gift.” Luqut is an imperative, probably derived from laqātum, “to pick up, to 
gather, to collect.” This is the understanding of our line in CAD L, 206 (under liqtu). Odd-
ly, the entry for laqātu in the CAD does not cite our line. The direct object of the impera-
tive follows in line 26. 
 
    
Line  26:  Mû,  see  line  19.  Saskûm  (sasqûm)  is  a  fine flour,  often  used in  rituals.  Mê 
saskîm can be drunk (see CAD S, 193). It is probably, therefore, some kind of liquid con-
coction  comprised  of saskû-flour and water that one can drink or pour  out as a libation 
offering. Ellūtim is plural and therefore must modify mê not saskîm. 
 
    
here.

Line  28:  (W)ašābum,  see  line  15.  Akālum,  “to  eat.”  GIŠ.GU.ZA  =  kussûm,  “chair, 
throne.”  KÙ.GI  =  ḫurāṣum,  “gold.”  GIŠ.BANŠUR  =  paššurum  (paššūrum),  “offering  table.” 
NA4.ZA.GÌN = uqnûm, “lapis lazuli.” The participles in this line both seem to describe Adad 
(notice that the participle is singular), whose divine dining furniture is made from precious 
materials. But given Adad’s secondary position in this prayer, perhaps the participles are 
best understood as describing Shamash (see also the series of 2ms verbs that follow this 
line). 
 
    
Line 29: All three verbs in this line are G 2ms duratives, derived from (w)arādum, “to 
go down, to descend,” akālum, “to eat,” and (w)ašābum, respectively. Although the verbs 
sound descriptive here, simply telling us what the god is going to do, these words are in 
fact directed at the god. They are probably best understood as telling the god what he is

Line 30: The opening prepositional phrase describes where Shamash (Adad?) is to sit 
(see line 29). Diānum (dânu), “to judge, to render a verdict.” Note the cognate accusative 
in the second half of the line.

ination” (gen.).

Line 35: The ša refers back to bilat bēlūtim in line 34 (see the parallel construction in 
lines 19–20). The sign marked x in the transliteration above is an undeciphered sign. Fos-
ter translates the word as “courtyard” (210), citing Andrew George as his source (211), but 
it  is  unclear  what  actually  stands  behind  that  suggestion.  One  would  presume  kisallu, 
“courtyard,” but its logogram does not fit the sign we have in the copy unless we suppose 
KISAL!. In the gap at the end of the line, we expect a verb in the subjunctive, as in lines 21 
and 43. But it is unclear what this verb should be.

Line 42: This line begins as lines 19 and 25 did. Mutqûm, “sweet bread.” 7= sebettum 
(the free form of  the number;  sebet[ti] is its absolute form) with masculine nouns. Since 
there are still unsolved issues with the pronunciation and syntax of numbers, the normali-
zation given here is an approximation. By “seven and seven,” the text means seven pairs. 
 
    
Line 43: The reading and syntax of this line follows N. Ghanem, “OB Divination Pray-
er YOS XI 22:42–43,” NABU 2012, #18. Ša refers back to mutqû. The meaning of perkum 
(pirkum) is unclear. In other contexts, the word may refer to a transverse line or the chord 
of a circle (in mathematical texts), a part of a gate, or a region/territory. Foster (210) sug-
gests  “row”  for  its  meaning  here  (likewise  Seux,  469,  n.16),  which  seems  contextually 
appropriate.  As  the  word  is  in  the  accusative,  Ghanem  proposes  to  read  it  adverbially,

modifying  the  verb  parākum,  “to  lie  across  transversely”  (here  a  3mp  predicative).  The 
next word,  šina, “two,”  is  likewise to be understood adverbially (“by twos”). Thus,  perkī 
šina may indicate a dual row-like arrangement of the bread. Until perku is clarified, how-
ever, the precise arrangement will remain unclear.

Lines 44–49: These lines repeat nearly verbatim the formula presented in lines 26b–

Line 50: After the by-now-familiar opening invocation and verb (see also lines 19, 25, 
and  42),  the  line  should  read  ḫi-iṣ-ba-am  rather  than  Goetze’s  ḫi-iš-ba-am  (likewise,  line 
54). Ḫiṣbum, “plenty, abundant yield.” As the next line implies, this “plenty” is to be iden-
tified as grain. 
 
    
Lines 51–53: Nuwwurum, “brilliance” (only recognized by CDA, 259). dNÍSABA (dNAGA), 
also read as dNÍDABA = Nisaba, goddess of grain (see page 351). Lines 51b–53 repeat lines 
11–13, the short version of the fuller formula used in lines 26b–33, 36–41, and 44–49.

Line  54:  Ušnālku  is  a  1cs  Š  durative  with  a  2ms  dative  pronominal  suffix  (without 
mimation, as in lines 2 and 8). The verb is derived from itūlum (utūlu, niālum, nâlu), which 
in the Š stem means “to make someone lie down, sleep, to lay something down.” For the 
remainder of the line, see the notes on lines 50–51.

Line 58: The copy shows that the scribe has mistakenly added an UM to the end of 
the line. Goetze believes this UM should have been placed at the end of qurādu, which is 
lacking mimation (see 25, n.1 and 27, n.9). Šib is the ms imperative of (w)ašābum. Lišbū is 
the 3mp precative of the same verb (compare the 3cs in line 15). The subject is announced 
in line 59. Qurādum, see line 21. 
 
    
 
    
Line 60: Several gods are now enumerated. They form the subject of the verb in line 
63. Annum is Anum, god of the sky (see page 217), or, as mentioned here, the abum, “fa-
ther,” of the šamûm, “heavens.” dEN.ZU = Sîn, who is the moon god (see page 385), šarrum, 
“king,” of the agûm, “crown, tiara.”  
 

Line 59: If one includes the verb in line 58 with it, this line is comparable to line 22.

Line 61: Nergal is a chthonic deity, who rules over pestilence and war (see page 339). 
Bēl X is a common construction in Akkadian. When referring to humans bēl may designate 
a person responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows, whether an office, object, or 
something more abstract (see CAD B, 198; e.g., bēl šutummi, “steward of the storehouse,” 
bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” or bēl dabābi, “adversary” [lit. “owner of a lawsuit”]). Similarly 
with  deities  (see  CAD  B,  193).  For  example,  Ea is  called  bēl  pirištim,  “lord  of  the  secret 
council,” in an OB text from Malgium. The phrase bēl kakkī, “lord of weapons,” identifies 
Nergal quite appropriately as an expert wielder of weapons. 
 
    
Line 62: dINANA = Ištar. Ishtar was the goddess of war and sex (see page 169). Bēltum, 
“lady,” is the feminine form of bēlum and implies the same idea of power and authority as 
that of its masculine form. Tāḫāzum, “battle, combat.” Bēlet tāḫāzim is a common epithet 
for Ishtar (see CAD T, 47). 
 
    
Line 63: For the verb, see line 58. Lines 60–63 compare to lines 58b–59. In the latter, 
the verb comes first, followed by the prepositional phrase and subject. In lines 60–63 we 
have the exact opposite order: the compound subject is in lines 60–62 with the verb and 
prepositional phrase following in line 63.

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
The suggestions offered in the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night (see page 
79) supply  a broad comparative view on the issue of extispicy and  divination. 
The following will focus on two particular issues only briefly: the use of cedar in 
Mesopotamian and biblical rituals and the idea of humans feeding the gods.  

Given the concerns for ritual purity among religious leaders the world over, 
it is not at all surprising that both ancient Mesopotamian and biblical texts spec-

ify  the  need  for  ritual  officials  to  purify  themselves  before  engaging  in  ritual 
activities. The means to do so in both cultures were very often similar. For ex-
ample, washing with water, shaving, and laundering one’s clothing were means 
of  purification  in  both  Mesopotamian  and  biblical  texts.1  What  is  distinctive 
when comparing Mesopotamian and biblical materials with regard to cedar (and 
its products) is just how different the two cultures treated this kind of wood. In 
Mesopotamia, cedar and its resin were used fairly frequently in ritual and medi-
cal  texts  as  a material  for  figurines  and  a  ritual  substance,  whether burned  as 
incense or rubbed on/held in one’s body as a purifying agent (see CAD E, 276–
79). It is striking that the biblical ritual corpora preserve only a few references 
to the role of cedar (BH ז ֶר ֶא). Only in the rituals for the purification of “leprosy” 
(i.e., scale disease, Lev 14) and corpse contamination (the red heifer ritual, Num 
19) does cedar play a role (see Lev 14:4, 6, 49, 51, 52 and Num 19:6). And even 
in  these two  cases cedar is  quite  secondary,  a mere  additive  to  the  blood  that 
acts as the real ritual detergent. In fact, Milgrom goes so far as to say that cedar 
was chosen for these particular rituals because of its reddish color and thus its 
association with blood (note also the use of a crimson yarn).2 There is no indica-
tion that such a symbolic association between blood and cedar existed in Meso-
potamia.3 Rather, one gets the impression that it was the aromatic nature of the 
wood that commended its ritual use. 
 
Our  prayer  very  clearly  sets  up  a  meal  for  the  gods,  around  which  they 
gather, eat, and then pronounce judgment. This explicitly anthropomorphic rep-
resentation  of the gods eating  a meal  has  a  close  counterpart  in  the  sacrificial 
practices depicted throughout the Hebrew Bible. Although a full presentation is 
not possible here, a few key pieces of evidence will make the case rather clear. 
Yahweh was offered a combination of meat, grain, and wine—things that look 
very much like  the elements of  a meal—every morning  and  evening (see Exod 
29:38–42). The sacrifices and offerings prescribed by ritual texts are often called 
“food” (ם ֶח ֶל, e.g., Lev 3:11, 16, 21:6, 8, 21, 22, and 28:2, 24). Yahweh’s altar is 
sometimes called a table (see Mal 1:7, where there is the mention of food [ם ֶח ֶל] 
and  a  parallel  between  י ִח ְבּ ְז ִמ  and  ה ָוֹה ְי  ן ַח ְל ֻשׁ;  see  also  v.  12).  Finally,  Yahweh’s 
offerings are very frequently described as a “pleasing aroma” to him (  ַוֹחי ִנ 
ַי ֵר; 
see Gen 8:21; Exod 29:18, 25, 41; Lev 1:9, 13, 17, 2:2, 9, 12, 3:5, 16, 4:31, 6:15, 
21, 8:21, 28, 17:6, 23:13, 18; Num 15:3, 7, 10, 13, 14, 24, 18:17, Num 28:2, 6, 
8, 13, 24, 27, and 29:2, 6, 8, 13, 36). Although there are very vocal statements 
(that get a lot of attention from modern scholars) in opposition to the view (see, 
e.g.,  the  strong  statement  in  Ps  50:12–14  and  prophetic  critiques  in,  e.g.,  Isa

van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction, 27–36. For a thorough discussion of ritual purity in the legisla-
tion of the Hebrew Bible, especially the pentateuchal Priestly Source, see David P. Wright, “Un-

York: Doubleday, 1991), 835. 
3  But as blood did not factor significantly into Mesopotamian rituals, this is not unexpected.

1:11–14,4 Jer 7:21–13, Amos 5:21–25, and Mic 6:6–8), it seems unavoidable to 
conclude that at least for some biblical authors sacrifices provided Yahweh with 
food.5 
 
4  Note, however, the use of the word עבשׂ, “to be sated,” in Isa 1:11, a word generally used of 
being sated with food and drink. 
5  See the discussion in Gary A. Anderson, “Sacrifice and Sacrificial Offerings (OT),” ABD 5:870–
86, especially 872 and 881–82.

An OB Letter-Prayer to Ninmug 

ALAN LENZI 

NINMUG:  

We  know  very  little  about  Ninmug,  if  that  is  the  correct  reading  of  her 
name.1 She was a minor goddess in Mesopotamia, often associated with crafts-
manship and birth. In some traditions, including our text, Ninmug is the wife of 
Ishum/Ḫendursaga.  In  Enki  and  the  World  Order,  line  406,  she  is  mentioned 
among several other goddesses as a sister of Enki (Akk. Ea). A handful of early 
texts bears witness to Ninmug’s cult at Mesopotamian sites such as Fara, perhaps 
Kisiga, Adab, Lagash, and Umma. Several Old Babylonian cylinder seal legends 
and  the  present  letter-prayer  indicate  that  her  veneration  continued  into  the 
second millennium.2 

THE PRAYER:  

As the opening few lines make clear, this short prayer was written in episto-
lary form. The language in the opening displays the same kind of social hierar-
chy as one might find in a letter addressed to royalty by a loyal subject: “your 
servant”  (waradki)  writes  to  “my  lady”  (bēltīya).  Unlike many  other prayers  in 
this  volume  that  contain  long  preliminary praise  or  extensive  lamentation  and 
petition, this letter-prayer gets to the point rather quickly (lines 5–7). Ninmug is 
simply  asked  to  intercede  on  behalf  of  Ninurta-qarrad,  the  (male)  supplicant, 
with  her  husband,  Ishum.  Apparently the  supplicant  believes  Ishum  is the  one 
who has the authority to change his situation. It is not at all atypical for a god-
 
1  See Cavigneaux and Krebernik, 471. 
2  According to Cavigneaux and Krebernik this early goddess may be related to a later male deity, 
dNin-MUG (473). This later deity, whose name is probably to be read dNin-zadim, played a role in 
the Mīs pî ritual complexes. See Christopher Walker and Michael Dick, The Induction of the Cult 
Image  in  Ancient  Mesopotamia:  The  Mesopotamian  Mīs  Pî  Ritual  (SAALT  1;  Helsinki:  The  Neo-
Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2001), 23, n.69 and throughout; see also Angelika Berlejung, Die 
Theologie  der  Bilder:  Herstellung und  Einweihung von Kultbildern in Mesopotamien  und die  alttesta-
mentliche  Bilderpolemik  (OBO  162;  Freiburg:  Universitätsverlag  /  Göttingen:  Vandenhoeck  & 
Ruprecht, 1998), 126.

dess to intercede with a god she can influence (line 4) on behalf of a supplicant 
(see, e.g., the prayer to Gula on page 243). 

Interestingly, more than half of the prayer (lines 8–19) consists of the sup-
plicant’s promise to give thanks to the goddess after she has interceded for him 
(notice the inūma, “when, at that time,” in lines 8 and 15). Giving thanks is both 
material and verbal: the supplicant will bring a sacrifice for Ishum and a sheep 
for Ninmug, but he will also “proclaim the praises” (dalīlī dalālu) of both deities. 
The latter phrase is something one sees quite often in various Akkadian prayers.

Lines 1–3: The first three lines of the text show a typical epistolary opening formula. 
Ana, “to.” Bēltum, “lady,” which in this case is a goddess. dNIN.MUG = Ninmug, the goddess 
to whom the letter is directed. Qabûm, “to say, to speak.” Umma is a particle that introduc-
es direct speech. One may translate it “thus says” or “PN says as follows.” The one speak-
ing  is  identified  after  the  particle.  Ninurta-qarrad  is  the  proper  name  of  the  supplicant. 
Wardum, “servant.”

Lines 4–7: Qabâki is an infinitive with a 2fs pronominal suffix; it is the object of the 
verb at the end of line 4. Ishum is the husband of Ninmug and the god with whom she is 
requested to intercede. Šemûm, “to hear, to listen to.” Line 4 provides the pre-existing basis 
for the petition in lines 5–7. Annītum, “this.” Ḫiṭītum, “shortfall, loss, sin.” Ša introduces a 
subordinate clause that modifies ḫiṭītim. Wabālum often means “to carry, to bring” (see line

12); but in this context it means “to commit” a sin (see CAD A/1, 18). Qātum, “hand.” Itti, 
“with.” Leqûm, “to take.” Qatam leqûm is an idiom meaning “to stand surety for someone,” 
which in this  context suggests intercession. The  beneficiary of the  action is indicated by 
the  pronominal  suffix  on  the  noun.  The  ubiquitous  presentation  scene  on  cylinder  seals 
provides visual confirmation of this description of intercession. In these scenes, a lamassu 
leads a human by the hand into the presence of a seated deity or king. 

qabâki Išum išemmi ana annītim ḫiṭītim ša ublam qatātīya itti Išum liqea 

Lines 8–14: Inūma, “when,” introduces a temporal clause that extends to the end of 
line 9. This clause sets up the prior condition for the main clause in lines 10–14. Telteqe is 
the  G  perf.  of  leqûm.  The  preposition  ina  can  be  translated  many  ways;  here  it  means 
“with.”  Pānīn,  “face,”  is  in  the  oblique  dual  case.  Namrum,  “bright,  radiant.”  “A  bright 
face” is usually understood to refer to a person’s emotional disposition. Without detracting 
from  this interpretation,  one  may  also  consider  the  possibility  that  this imagery  derived 
from  the  fact  that  a  person  would  normally  anoint  themselves  with  oil  as  part  of  their 
daily hygienic practices. A person in mourning or doing penance would not carry out this 
daily routine; rather, they would display their sorrow or contrition via their unkempt ap-
pearance.  Notice  the  adj.  is  not nawrum  as  one  might  expect in  an  OB  context.  Nīqium, 
“sacrifice, offering.” U, “and.” Kâšim, “to, for you.” UDU.NÍTA = immerum, “sheep.” 

inūma qatātīya talteqe ina pānīn namrūtim ana Išum nīqiam ubbalam u ana kâšim  
immeram ubbalam 

Lines 15–19: Lines 15–17  contain a temporal  clause that introduces the time  frame 
(rather  than  prior  condition)  of  the  main  clause  in  lines  18–19.  Dalīlū,  “praises.”  Ana 
maḫar, “in front of, in the presence of.” Dalālum, “to praise.” Adallalu bears the subjunctive 
–u because the verb ends the subordinate clause that began with line 15. Dalīlī dalālum is a 
cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same 
root.  One  should  translate this idiomatically, “to  proclaim praises” or  the like. The  final 
verb is a 1cs precative and is ubiquitous in Akkadian prayers of all periods. 

inūma dalīlī ana maḫar Išum adallalu u dalīlīki ludlul 

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

The idea of presenting a petitionary letter to a deity follows logically from 
the dominant social model upon  which ancient Near Eastern  concepts of deity 
were generally  based,  the  royal  elites  of  society.  Letters  addressed  to  the  king

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

from subjects for the purpose of obtaining something (sometimes of only person-
al importance) are commonplace in the ancient record. It therefore seems quite 
reasonable to apply the same idea to deities. If one wants something, one writes 
to the deity and sends it to their house (a temple) for their perusal.  

Although we do not find letter-prayers in the Hebrew Bible,1 we do have a 
case in 2 Kgs 19:14–19, where a king, Hezekiah, takes a letter that he himself 
received  from  a  foreign  king,  Sennacherib,  to  the  temple  of  the  Israelite  god, 
Yahweh, in order to petition the god to assistant him against the threats of the 
foreign  king.  It  is  significant  that  this  text  mentions  the  fact  that  Hezekiah 
spread the letter out in front of Yahweh (v. 14; ה ָוֹהְי י ֵנ ְפ ִל וּהָיּ ִק ְז ִח וּה ֵשׂ ְר ְפ ִיּ ַו).2 Whatev-
er “before Yahweh” may have meant precisely to the biblical author (or in his-
torical Judah at the end of the eighth century BCE), Hezekiah intends for Yahweh 
to  see  and  hear  the  letter  along  with  his  own prayer,  as  his petitions  in  v.  16 
make clear, so that  Yahweh will act accordingly. Although the  presentation of 
this human letter to the Israelite god is not a precise parallel to our Mesopota-
mian letter-prayer, the idea of placing a letter in front of the Israelite god bears 
a striking resemblance to the mentality that gave rise to the letter-prayer in an-
cient Mesopotamia 
 
1  Building on the suggestions of earlier scholars, William Hallo has cautiously connected Hezeki-
ah’s ב ָתּ ְכ ִמ, “letter,” mentioned in Isa 38:9 to the Sumerian letter-prayer tradition. See William W. 
Hallo, “The  Royal  Correspondence of Larsa: I. A  Sumerian Prototype for the Prayer  of  Hezeki-
ah?” in Kramer Anniversary Volume: Cuneiform Studies in Honor of Samuel Noah Kramer (ed. B. L. 
Eichler; AOAT 25; Kevelaer: Butzon & Bercker / Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1976), 209–
24; repr. in William W. Hallo, The World’s Oldest Literature: Studies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres (Cul-
ture  and  History  of  the  Ancient  Near  East  35;  Boston/Leiden:  Brill,  2010),  333–51.  But  Hallo 
recognizes that ב ָתּ ְכ ִמ should probably be read here as ם ָתּ ְכ ִמ, “inscription,” a word found among 
the superscriptions in the Psalter (see Pss 16 and 57–60), and that the content of its text, given 
in vv. 10–20, is not a letter at all. 
2  Is it significant  that the BH verb used here to  describe Hezekiah’s placement of the  letter is 
used elsewhere to describe a ritual gesture of the hands in prayer? See, e.g., 2 Kgs 8:22, HALOT, 
976, and page 239 in this volume. 

TRANSLATION: 

1.–2.  Speak  to  my  lady  Ninmug,  3.  thus  says  Ninurta-qarrad,  your  servant:  4. 
“(Because) Ishum listens to your speaking, 5.–7. intercede for me with Ishum for 
this  sin  that  I  committed.  8.–9.  When  you  have  interceded  for me,  10.  with  a 
cheerful attitude 11.–12. I will bring a sacrifice to Ishum 13.–14. and to you  I 
will bring a sheep. 15.–17. When I proclaim praises before Ishum, 18.–19. I will 
(also) proclaim praises to you.”

An OB Royal Hymn to Ishtar 

ALAN LENZI 

ISHTAR:  

See page 169. 

THE HYMN:  

This OB hymn to Ishtar comprises fourteen quatrains, each separated from 
the next by an inscribed line on the tablet.1 The first ten praise Ishtar (lines 1–
40). The remaining four (lines 41–56) turn attention to the king the hymn was 
to benefit: Ammiditana (1683–1647  BCE),  the great-grandson of Hammurabi. A 
three line refrain (lines 57–59) and a rubric (line 60) complete the text. 

The first ten stanzas fall into two equal parts, marked formally by a recur-
ring pattern: the first two stanzas  of each half (i, ii, vi, and vii)  utilize the so-
called Sumerian hymnic style; the other three do not (iii–v and viii–x). As one 
will see, the Sumerian hymnic style in a quatrain consists of two nearly identical 
couplets. The first couplet describes the deity, identifying her with only a gener-
ic  term  (e.g., iltam);  the  second  couplet repeats  the  first  verbatim but  replaces 
the generic term with the deity’s proper name (see also the hymn to Marduk in 
Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I  1–4, page 485 in this volume). Thematically-speaking, each 
half of the first ten stanzas focuses on different aspects of the goddess. Stanzas i–
v  center  on  the  description  of  her  person, lauding  her greatness,  her sexuality, 
her loveliness, her intelligence, and her personality. Stanzas vi–x center on the 
description of her position among the gods, celebrating her greatness (compare 
stanza  i), her word/authority, her title and rank, her  equality  to Anu, and her 
court. Considered as a whole, the ten stanzas present a full picture of the god-
dess, personally and professionally. 

The  final  four  stanzas  of  the  text  deal  with  Ishtar’s  beneficence  to  Am-
miditana.  The  first  stanza  depicts  the  king’s piety,  showing  him  worthy  of  the 
heavenly queen’s favor.2 The second and third stanzas describe Ishtar’s interces-
 
1  Eight stanzas appear on the obverse and six on the reverse of the only tablet attesting the text. 
2  Note how  stanza xi introduces Ammiditana:  first generically in line  41 and  then  by name in 
line  43—a  partial  imitation  of the Sumerian  hymnic  style  used  for  Ishtar.  It is  also  worthy  of

sion on his behalf with Anu and her gift of long life to him as well as universal 
dominion—both  common  desires  of  Mesopotamian  kings  (see,  e.g.,  Nebuchad-
nezzar’s  royal  prayer  on  page  475).  The  last  stanza  reflexively  describes  the 
hymn itself and how the king’s recitation of it will elicit a blessing from Ea, god 
of wisdom (see page 227).  

The  final  three  lines  of  the  text  form  what  line  60  calls  “its  antiphonal,” 
perhaps  the  refrain  that  would  be  used  in  antiphonal  recitations  of  the  hymn. 
These three lines, like the preceding stanzas, are separated by an inscribed line 
on the tablet. 
 
note that Ishtar is called the queen in line 29 while Ammiditana is introduced as the king (line 
41).

Line 3: Adopting the typical Sumerian hymnic style, the opening couplet is repeated 
nearly verbatim in lines 3–4. The second stanza (lines 5–8) shows the same literary arti-
fice. The major difference between this line and line 1, of course, is that the deity’s name 
(IŠ8.DAR = Ištar) replaces the more general word for goddess (iltam).

clothes herself. Labāšum, “to clothe oneself, to put on.” Labšat is a 3fs predicative. 
 
   
Line 6: Zaʾānum, “to be adorned.” The G predicative is only used of gods and means 
“to  be  decorated  with”  (see  CDA,  442).  Inbum,  “fruit,  sexual  allure.”  Mikûm,  “seductive 
charm.” (The  CAD normalizes the word as  mēqû and renders it  “cosmetics,” see I/J, 20. 
Such a rendering is unlikely.) U, “and.” Kuzbum, “attractiveness, sexual appeal.” 
 
   
 
   
Gilgamesh (see, e.g., I 181, 189 and I 237). 

Line 7: The previous couplet’s first line is repeated, substituting the goddess’s name. 
Ištar mēleṣim ruʾāmam labšat  

Line 8: Kuzbum is also used to describe both Shamḫat and Gilgamesh in the Epic of

Line 9: Šaptān, “lips” (d). Šaptīn is in the oblique case (gen.–acc.) and functions as an 
adverbial accusative. Duššupum, “sweetened, very sweet,” is a denominative (D stem) from 
dišpum, “honey.” One may wish to use some form of honey in the translation: “honeyed” or 
“dripping  with honey.”  The adj. is used as a 3fs predicative here.  Balāṭum, “life, health, 
vigor.” Pûm, “mouth.” The line suggests both the allure of the goddess (in that kissing her 
would be sweet) as well as her powers to sustain life (in that carbohydrate-loaded honey

would revive one’s strength). In light of lines 6 and 8, “lips” and “mouth” in this line are 
likely to be understood as double entendres. 
 
   
Line 10: Simtum has a wide semantic range, including “person or thing that is fitting, 
suitable, seemly, appropriate, necessary,” “person or thing that befits, does honor to, is the 
pride of,” “appurtenances, ornament, characteristic, insigne, proper appearance or behav-
ior  or  ways,  figural  representation,”  and  “face,  features”  (see  CAD  S,  278).  The  latter 
meaning is most appropriate here (see CAD S, 283). The form simtišša includes the termi-
native-adverbial ending –iš before the 3fs pronominal suffix, –ša (note also that the result-
ing –šš– does not change to –ss–). The adverbial ending in this construction has a locative 
meaning (“in” or “on”). Ṣīḫtum, “smile” (pl. ṣīḫātum). Ḫanāmum, “to thrive, to be luxuriant, 
to flourish” (see CDA, 105; AHw, 320). The older CAD Ḫ volume suggests “to bloom” (76), 
but this meaning cannot account for the verb’s use with sheep, noted in CDA and AHw. 
 
   
Line 11: Šarḫum, “proud, magnificent, splendid” (used as a 3fs predicative). On the 
basis of the context, it is likely that the adjective describes Ishtar’s appearance rather than 
her internal attitude. I-ri-mu is difficult. The text may be read as irimmu (so CAD I/J, 177 
and CDA, 131) and translated “beaded necklace” or the like. Joan and Aage Westenholz 
(“Help  for  Rejected  Suitors:  The  Old  Akkadian  Love  Incantation  MAD  V  8,”  Or  n.s.  46 
[1977], 198–219, specifically, 205–7) argue that the word “īrimum (or irīmum ?) denotes a 
quality, apparently mostly of females, which makes its possessor irresistibly attractive to 
the opposite sex” (206). They suggest the word has an abstract meaning in its plural form: 
“loveliness, love.” (The singular, they suggest, may be used to designate a personification 
of the attribute in the form of a mythological being like the Greek Eros or Roman Cupid 
[see 205 and 207]. For further support for the Babylonian Cupid from a new OB love po-
em, see A. R. George, Babylonian Literary Texts in the Schøyen Collection [Cornell University 
Studies in Assyriology and Sumerology 10; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2009], 53.) Following the 
Westenholzes, Foster translates the word as “love-charms,” but he also recognizes the pos-
sibility that these may take the form of “a necklace or headband” (85, n.1). Ramûm, “to set 
in place, to be endowed with.” The form is a 3mp predicative. Rēšum, “head.” The loca-
tive-adverbial ending –um and a 3fs pronominal suffix are attached to the noun, describing 
where the beads have been placed. The m of the locative-adverbial ending assimilates to 
the  š  of  the  pronominal  suffix  (–mš–  becomes  –šš–).  Notice  the  consonance  in  the  final 
three words of the line.  
 
   
Line 12: Banûm, “good, beautiful.” Šimtum, “mark, token,” may refer to skin tone; as 
it  is  dual,  perhaps  it  refers  to  rosy  cheeks  (CDA,  373).  Bitrāmum,  “multi-colored.”  Īnū, 
“eyes.” Šitʾārum, “variegated, iridescent.” The adjectives in this line are 3fp predicatives.

16.   ba-aš-tum ma-aš-ra-ḫu la-ma-as-su-um še-e-du-um 
 
 
 
 
   
Line 13: Eltum is probably a by-form of iltum, “goddess,” but has also been understood 
to mean “pure one” (see Hecker, 722, n.13a). This opening word is an anacoluthon that 
establishes the topic of the line, the goddess. Išti, “with.” We expect the suffixed form to be 
ištīša but ištaša is attested elsewhere in OB Akkadian (see CAD I/J, 283). The preposition 
almost always occurs with a suffix; the one known exception is in our line 45. One could 
argue that the preposition is to be understood as ištu, “from, out of,” but the context sug-
gests  the  line  should  be  about  characterizing  the  goddess  herself—what  she  possesses—
rather than what comes from her. Bašûm, “to be, to exist.” Milkum, “counsel, advice, intel-
ligence,” is the grammatical subject of the sentence. 
 
   
Line  14:  Šīmtum,  “what  is  fixed,  fate,  destiny.”  Šīmāt  is  a  fp  construct  form. 
Mimmāmu/a/i,  “everything,  all.”  Qātum,  “hand.”  Here  again  we  see  the  terminative-
adverbial  ending  followed  by  a  pronominal  suffix  indicating  location.  Tamāḫum,  “to 
grasp.” The form looks like a 3fs predicative, but it is a transitive parsāku (thus the object). 
 
   
Line 15: Naplāsum, “glance, look” (a noun), bears the locative-adverbial ending (–um) 
and a 3fs pronominal suffix. The m of the locative assimilates to the š of the suffix. Bani 
may derive from banûm, “to be good” (see CAD B, 91, though translating it with “is creat-
ed (?),” AHw, 102, 135, and Seux, 40; see also the cognate in line 12). But von Soden’s 
earlier translation in this line, “ist . . . geschaffen,” “is . . . created,” suggests a derivation 
from banûm, “to build, to engender, to create” (likewise Foster’s “is born” [86]). Buʾārum, 
“health, prosperity, happiness.” Notice the lack of mimation on the final substantive. 
 
   
Line 16: The list of things engendered by Ishtar’s glance continues. Bāštum (baštum), 
“dignity, good looks, pride,” sometimes occurs in contexts with lamassum and šēdum (see 
CAD  B,  142).  Mašraḫū,  “good  health  (?)”  (always  pl.);  CAD  M,  385  suggests  “splendor, 
attractiveness.” The word only occurs twice in extant texts, both times in OB hymns. La-
massum and šēdum were protective spirits that guarded individuals, temples, and cities. See 
further Daniel Foxvog, Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and Wolfgang Heimpel, “Lamma/Lamassu. 
A.I.  Mesopotamien.  Philogisch,”  RlA  6  (1980–1983),  446–53.  For  individuals,  they  are 
closely associated with the personal god and goddess (see, e.g., Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, I 43–46).

21.   a-ia-um na-ar-bi-à-aš i-ša-an-na-an ma-an-nu-um 
 
   
Line 17: Several obscure words make this line difficult. The first word may be tartāmū 
(pl), “mutual love” (CAD T, 245), “love-making” (CDA, 400), “whispers” (see Foster, 86, 
citing W. von Soden, review of Marie-Joseph Seux, Hymnes et prières aux dieux de Babylonie 
et d’Assyrie. Introduction, traduction et notes, ZA 67 [1977], 279 but see also AHw, 1332). 
But it may also be a 3fs form of ramû, tartāmi (see CAD T, 245 and 374, Seux, 40, and von 
Soden, 235). There are several verbal forms with a ta– affix in the next several lines that 
must  be  understood  as  3fs.  Tešmûm,  “attention,  listening,  compliance.”  Ritūmum,  “in-
tense(?) love, passion” (CAD R, 391), “love-making” (CDA, 306). Ṭūbum, “goodness, hap-
piness, prosperity, good will, peace, contentedness, satisfaction.” 
 
   
Line 18: Mitgurum is a Gt infinitive used as a substantive, meaning “agreement, gra-
ciousness.” Bêlum, “to rule over, to control, to dispose of.” Given the context of describing 
the goddess’s attributes, the verb should be understood as a durative. Šī, “she.” The pres-
ence of the independent pronoun indicates emphasis. 
 
    
Line 19: Ardatum, “young woman.” The noun is bound to the following verb, which 
comprises a short subordinate clause that describes the young woman. Ta-at-ta-ab is prob-
lematic since we expect a subjunctive on the verb. Thureau-Dangin takes ta-at-ta-ab for the 
verb  tattabû,  a  3fs  (see  also  the  final  verb  in  the  line)  perfect  from  nabûm,  “to  call,  to 
name” (see 175, n.9). Others (e.g., von Soden, 236 [implied by translation]) have opted to 
read  the  signs  as  ta-at-ta-du!,  presumably  understanding  the  form  as  an  N  3fs  perfect 
(tattaddû) from nadûm, “to throw down,” here “to abandon.” See Seux, 40, n.9 for a brief 
discussion  and  his  preference  for  the  former  verb.  Neither  option  is  without  problems. 
Ummum, “mother.” Notice the loss of mimation. Rašûm, “to acquire, to obtain.” Tarašši is a 
3fs durative.  
 
   
Line 20: Zakārum, “to say, to speak, to invoke.” I-ni-ši may be a sandhi writing for ina 
iššī, “among the women” (iniššī) or “ina nišī, “among the people” (innišī). See lines 2 and 4, 
Seux, 40, n.10, and Foster, 88 at the note for line 20. For nabûm, see the note on line 19. 
Šumum, “name.” Invoking or calling on the name of a deity was a means of honoring them. 
 
   
Line  21:  Ayyum  (see  CAD  ajû),  “who?,  which?”  Narbium,  “greatness.”  The  š  on  the 
noun is an apocopated 3fs pronominal suffix (narbiam + ša > narbiašša > narbiaš). The 
initial  sound  of  the  following  verb  may  have  contributed  to  the  loss  of  the  suffix’s  a.

Šanānum, “to rival, to equal.” Mannum, “who?” The line contains two question words, thus 
two questions. 
 
   
Line  22:  Gašrum,  “powerful,  mighty.”  Ṣīrum,  “exalted,  supreme,  splendid.”  Šūpûm, 
“manifest, resplendent, brillliant.” All of the adjs. are mp predicatives. Parṣū, “cultic ordi-
nances, rites.” 
 
   
Line  23:  The  poem  returns  to  the  Sumerian  hymnic  style  used  in  the  opening  two 
stanzas of the hymn. Ishtar’s name here, however, does not replace a pronoun in line 21 
that refers to her. Rather, the initial interrogative pronoun there (ayyum) is removed and 
the inserted divine name here in line 23 functions as an anacoluthon, similar to the use of 
eltum at the opening of line 13. 
 
   
 
   
Line 25: The initial signs on the tablet are bi-a-at; the present reading comes from von 
Soden (see Foster, 86 at the note on line 25 and Seux, 40, n.11). Šāt, see line 5. Again, the 
presence of the independent pronoun here is emphatic (and redundant with the pronomi-
nal suffix  on nazzāzuš). Atārum,  “to exceed in number or size,  to surpass in importance, 
quality.” The form  atar is 3ms  predicative.  I-ni-li is probably a sandhi writing for  ina  ilī, 
“among  the  gods”  (see  similarly  line  20).  Nanzāzum  (nanzazum,  nazzāzum),  “attendant, 
courtier; position, station.” The latter meaning is most appropriate here.   
 

Line 24: This line repeats line 22 verbatim. 
gašrū ṣīrū šūpû parṣūša 

Ištar narbiaš išannan mannum  

šāt inilī atar nazzāzuš 

   
Line 26: Kabātum, “to be(come) heavy, important, respected.” Amātum, “word, mat-
ter.” Notice we have the later form of the word rather than awātum; the former does occa-
sionally  occur  in  OB  Akkadian  contexts.  The  addition  of  the  3fs  pronominal  suffix,  –ša, 
directly to the base of the noun, amāt–, results in the sound change: –tš– becomes –ss–. El, 
“on, above, beyond,” is a by-form of the more common preposition eli. It is unclear wheth-
er  the  pronominal  suffix  attached  to  the  preposition  refers  to  the  gods’  words  (“over 
them,” i.e., their words) or to the gods themselves (“over them,” i.e., the gods). Regarding 
ḫa-AB-ta-at-ma, the middle radical of the root from which the final verb derives is disput-
ed; thus, the AB sign is in Roman capital letters. CAD Ḫ derives  the verb from  ḫabātum

Line 27: Once again the previous couplet is repeated with the predictable substitution 

kabtat amāssa elšunu ḫabtat-ma 

Ištar inilī atar nazzāzuš 

Line  28:  The  goddess’s  position  and  the  effectiveness  of  her  word  are  inextricably 

   
linked. 

kabtat amāssa elšunu ḫabtat-ma  

kullassun šâš kamsūši 

šarrassun uštanaddanū siqrīša 

   
Line 29: Šarratum, “queen.” The form šarrassun is a 3fs predicative with a shortened 
3mp pronominal suffix, –šun(u), attached to it. Šutadunnum (Št lex. of nadānum), “to delib-
erate, to discuss something (with others).” The form is a 3mp durative. Siqrum is a by-form 
of  zikrum,  “utterance,  speech,  command.”  See  GAG  §30c  for  the  occurrence  of  s  for  an 
expected z. 
 
   
Line 30: Kullatum, “all of, totality.” Šâš is an OB poetic form of the dative pronoun 
šâšim, “to her.” Kamāsum, “to kneel, to crouch.” The 3fs dative suffix (without the final m) 
on the predicative is redundant with šâš earlier in the line. 
 
   
Line 31: Nannārum (nannarum), “luminary, light of the sky, moon.” This is a common 
epithet of the moon god Sin and occasionally for Ishtar. Thureau-Dangin reads the  final 
verb as i-la-qú-ši-im, deriving it from leqûm, “to receive.” Others have suggested the present 
reading, which derives the verb from alākum, “to go.” See Foster, 88 at the note for line 31 
for references. 
 
   
Line 32: Iššū, “women.” Awīlum, “man, human being.” In light of the first plural noun, 
the singular  one that follows is probably either a mistake or functioning as a collective. 
Palāḫum,  “to fear.” Given  the fact that there is an object on the verb, we should under-
stand the form as a transitive parsāku construction.

Line 33:  Puḫrum,  “assembly.”  The noun also bears the terminative-adverbial ending  
(–iš) and a shortened 3mp pronominal suffix. This assembly is the divine council. The sub-
stantive etellum can have a nominal sense, “lord, prince,” as well as an adjectival one, “pre-
eminent,” as here. Šūturum, “supreme, surpassing.” Both adjectives in the line are predica-
tives. Ishtar’s word is authoritative, which is partly due to her position (line 34) but also a 
product of her insight (see line 35). 
 
   
Line 34: Ana, “to, for.” An-nim is for Anim, the genitive of Anum. Anu(m) is the Meso-
potamian sky god (see page 217). Šarrum, “king.” Malâm, “as an equal,” only occurs here 
and in the Agushaya Poem. (W)ašābum, “to sit,  to dwell.” The form of the verb is a 3fs 
predicative. The accusative pronominal suffix is not a direct object; rather, it is an adver-
bial accusative describing the goddess’s sitting. She sits “with them” or “among them,” i.e., 
with/among the other gods. 
 
   
Line 35: Uznum, literally “ear” but also “understanding.” Nēmequm, “knowledge, wis-
dom, experience.” We expect  an accusative rather  than a  genitive  case ending. Ḫasīsum, 
“ear,  hearing,  wisdom,  comprehension.”  All  three  words  modify  eršet  adverbially.  Eršu, 
“wise,” is used as a 3fs predicative. Line 33 asserted the authority of Ishtar’s word. Here 
we see a reason for that authority: she speaks with wisdom.  
 
   
Line  36:  Mitlukum  (Gt  of  malākum),  “to  confer  (about  something),  to  discuss  (with 
others).” Ḫammum, “master, head of household, head of family.” Ishtar’s ḫammum is cer-
tainly Anu. The line states the conclusion for which the previous lines of the stanza have 
prepared. 
 
   
Line 37: Ramûm is the same word as in line 11, but here it means “to take up resi-
dence, to occupy.” For other occurrences with parakkum, see CAD R, 134. Ištīniš (ištēniš), 
“together.”  Parakkum,  “cult,  dais,  sanctuary.”  Again  we  see  Ishtar  described  as  equal  in 
rank to Anu.

Line  38:  Iggegunnîm  is  the  result  of  ina  plus  gegu(n)nûm  (gigunû),  “raised  temple.” 
Gegunnûm is some  kind of “sacred building erected  on terraces” (CAD G,  67). The word 
sometimes  occurs  in  apposition  to  ziqqurratum,  “ziggurrat,  temple  step-tower,”  and  may 
refer “to the sanctuary on top of the temple tower” (CAD G, 70). Šubtum, “dwelling, seat.” 
Rīštum, “joy, exultation, jubilation.” Rīšātim is a plural. 

iggegunnîm šubat rīšātim 

muttiššun ilū nazuzzū 

ipšiš pīšunu bašiā uznāšun  

   
Line 39: Muttiš, “in front of, before.” Ilu, “god, deity.” Nazuzzū is a 3mp predicative 
from nazzazum (N of i/uzuzzu; see GAG §107e), “to appear, to become present.” The i in 
the third sign of the verb’s orthography is superfluous. This line provides another aspect of 
Ishtar’s authority: the gods appear before her (and Anu) as servants. 
 
   
Line  40:  Ipšum  means  “deed,  action.”  But  bound  to  pûm,  “mouth,”  ipiš  pî  means 
“speech, command” (see CAD I/J, 170). The form of the word here, ipšiš, is to be explained 
as  ipšu  plus  the  terminative-adverbial  ending,  which  has  replaced  the  preposition  ana. 
Bašûm means “to be, to be available” but with ears and eyes, “to be fixed on, to be atten-
tive.” Uznāšun is the nom. dual of uznum with an apocopated 3mp pronominal suffix. The 
servile status of the other gods, intimated in the previous line, is confirmed and described

Line  41:  This  line  subtly  introduces  Ammiditana  (see  line  43),  the  OB  king  who  is 
lauded  here  as  the  beneficiary  of  Ishtar’s  largess.  Migrum  can  mean  “consent,  approval, 
agreement”  but  also  “favored  one,  favorite”  (see  CAD  M/2,  48),  as  is  appropriate  here.  
Narāmum, “beloved.” Libbum, “heart.” This line only introduces the subject of the sentence, 
which is completed in the next line. 
 
šarrum migrašun narām libbīšun 
   
Line 42: Šarḫiš, “proudly, splendidly, in a lavish manner.” Itaqqû, (Gtn of naqû), “to 
offer a libation, sacrifice repeatedly.” The form of the verb is durative, though one might 
expect ittanaqqi. The present form may be explained by the fact that the Gtn stem of I-n 
and I-w verbs sometimes elide the –ta– (see GAG §91d and §102k). The pronominal suffix 
is a 3mp accusative, though a dative, –šunūšim, is expected. As is often the case in this text, 
the final short vowel has dropped off. Nīqum, “offering, sacrifice.” Ellum, “pure, holy.”

Line  43:  Ammiditana  (1683–1647  BCE) is the  name  of  Hammurabi’s  great-grandson. 
Nīqi is bound to the following noun, qātum, “hand,” and functions as an accusative, modi-
fied by ellam. Ellam nīqi qātīšu is parallel with and grammatically in apposition to lî u yalī 
namrāʾī in line 44. Note Foster’s conflated translation: “His personal, pure libation of cattle 
and fatted stags” (87). Both phrases are the direct object of the verb in line 44. 
 
   
Line  44:  Maḫrum  as  a  preposition  means  “before,  in  front  of,  in  the  presence  of.” 
Šubbûm  (D  of  šebûm),  “to  fill  with,  to  satisfy  with  (=  acc.).”  Lûm  (līʾum),  “bull.”  Yalum 
(ayyalum, ajalu), “stag, deer.” Namrāʾū, “fattened” (pl).  
 
   
Line 45: Išti here means “from.” Ḫāmirum (ḫāwirum), “husband.” Erēšum, “to request, 
to demand” from (= išti). The form of the verb is perfect (tētereš), as is the case through-
out this stanza, with both a ventive (–am) and a 3ms dative (–šum) suffix on the end. The 
object  of  the  verb  is  contained  in  the  following  line.  Other  traditions  make  Ishtar  the 
daughter rather than the spouse of Anu. 
 
   
 
   
Line 47: Mādum, “many, numerous.” Šattum, “year.” Ana Ammiditana makes explicit 
the referent of the dative pronominal suffix on the verb in the previous couplet (see line 
45). 
 
   
lim is a 3fs preterite. Nadānum, “to give.” Tattadin is a 3fs perfect.  
 
   
Line  49:  Siqrum,  see  line  29,  bears  the  locative-adverbial  ending,  –um,  substituting

Line 52: Ṣamādum, “to yoke, to tie up.” The form is a 3fs perfect with a 3mp accusa-
tive pronominal suffix, which is redundant with the object expressed already in the previ-
ous line. The t of the perfect infix assimilates to the sibilant first root letter (–ṣt– become   
–ṣṣ–).  Also,  the  –dš–  cluster  at  the  boundary  of  the  verb  and  suffix  becomes  –ss–.  Nīru, 
“yoke.” Ana + nīru + 3ms pronominal suffix –šu results in anīrīšu. With regard to the last 
two signs in the line, see lines 39 and 54 for a similar orthography. 
 
   
Line 53: Biblum means “the (action of) bringing, things brought.” But the phrase bibil 
(bibel) libbim means “heart’s desire.” Zamārum, “song.” Lalûm, “exuberance, desire, (sexual) 
charms.” CAD L, 50 translates zamār lalêša as “her favorite song.” 
 
   
Line  54:  Naṭûm,  “suitable,  fitting.”  The  word  describes  the  phrases  in  the  previous 
line. The “his” of ana pīšu is probably king Ammiditana. Ea is the god of wisdom, magic, 
and water (see page 227). Epēšum, “to do, to make,” but with an object in the semantic 
domain of speech or speaking (here, siqrum), “to speak.” Īpussi is the 3cs preterite plus a 
3fs dative pronominal suffix (–šim). The subject is the king. 
 
   
Line  55:  Šemûm,  “to  hear.”  The  verb  is  3cs;  Ea  is  the  subject.  Tanittum,  “praise.” 
Riāšum, “to rejoice, to exult in, to exult over.” Irīš is a 3cs preterite with a 3ms pronominal 
suffix. The verbal action is sequential.

Line 56: This line seems to provide the content of Ea’s exultation. Balāṭum, “to live, to 
be healthy.” The form is a 3cs precative (as is the other verb in the line). The king is the 
beneficiary of the well-wishing, that is, he is the grammatical subject. Šarrašu, “his king,” 
the subject of the second precative, refers to the king’s king, perhaps the city god. But it is 
unclear. See Thureau-Dangin, 177, n.3 (also Foster, 87, n.2). Râmum, “to love.” Addāriš is 
ana plus dāriš, “forever.”  
 
   
Line  57:  Lines  57–59 are the  antiphonal  refrain.  Rāʾimīki  is  a  G ms  participle  from 
râmum (see line 56) with a 2fs pronominal suffix. The participle modifies šarri. Note, also, 
the loss of mimation in šarri. Just as Ea requested that his king love Ammiditana (line 56), 
he characterizes Ammiditana as one who loves the goddess. 
 
   
Line  58:  For  arkam  dāriam  balāṭam,  the  object  of  the  (fs)  imperative,  see  line  46. 
Šarākum, “to grant, to bestow.” The line repeats sentiments expressed already in lines 46 
and 47. 
 
   
Line 59: See line 56 for the verb. Wishing the king long life was not only a means to 
show loyalty to the king, it might also be in the best interest of the wisher. The transition 
from one king to another could be marred by civil unrest and/or military action. 
 
   
Line  60:  This  line  is  composed  in  Sumerian,  which  translates  into  Akkadian  as 
miḫiršu. It means “its antiphonal.” The term is found in several OB hymnic compositions.

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

Although there are several hymns in the Hebrew Bible to Yahweh (e.g., Pss 
8,  29,  Nah  1:2–8,  etc.),1  there  are  no  hymns  to  goddesses. Perhaps  the  closest 
candidate  of  such  is  the  self-description  of  the  female  personified  Wisdom  in 
 
1  See Hermann Gunkel  and Joachim  Begrich,  Introduction  to  the  Psalms:  The  Genres of the Reli-
gious Lyrics of Israel (trans. James D. Nogalski; Macon: Mercer University Press, 1998), 22–23 for 
a rather full listing of hymns and “hymn-like elements” in the Hebrew Bible. 

 

124

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Prov  8:4–36.2  But  only  a  small  minority  of  scholars  believes  Wisdom  has  the 
attributes here of a full-fledged, independent goddess.3 The so very obvious ab-
sence of licit (or sanctioned) goddess worship in the Hebrew Bible is one of the 
Bible’s most distinctive features as compared to other ancient Near Eastern reli-
gious texts.4 

 ֵנוֹשׁ ְל ת ַח ַתּ ב ָל ָח ְו שׁ ַב

 ְדּ ה ָלּ ַכּ ך ִי ַתוֹת ְפ ִשׂ ה ָנ ְפֹטּ ִתּ ת ֶפֹנ

On  a  smaller  scale,  several  phrases  in  our  hymn  merit  comparative  atten-
tion. In line 9 Ishtar is enticingly described as having lips dripping with honey. 
The same sensual idea is found in Song 4:11, where the female lover is described 
as follows: 
, “your lips drip pure honey, 
honey and milk (lie) under your tongue.”5 It seems rather clear that in both cas-
es honey functions as a sensual metaphor for the desirability of kissing feminine 
lips.6 Yet the juxtaposition of the phrase in line 9a of our hymn with the state-
ment in line 9b, namely, “her mouth (is) vivacity” (balāṭum, lit. “life”), suggests 
that honey is more than an ancient flavored lip gloss in the hymn. Honey is also 
life-sustaining; its sweetness invigorates. The same idea is expressed literally in 1 
Sam  14:24–30,  the  account  of  Jonathan  disobeying  his father’s  oath  by  eating 
some  honey  found  in  the  field,  and  used  metaphorically  in  Prov  24:13–14, 
where the desirability of eating honey is used to impress upon young boys (note 
י ִנ ְבּ, “my son” in v. 13) the desirability of obtaining wisdom. For with wisdom, so 
the proverb goes, ת ֵר ָכּ ִת אֹ ל  ְת ָו ְק ִת ְו תי ִר ֲח ַא שֵׁי, “there is a future, and your hope will 
not be cut off” (v. 14).  

 

The  incomparability  of  the  goddess  trope  that  we  see  in  lines  21  and  23 
compares to  similar  hymnic  expressions  used  of  Yahweh.7  For  example,  in  the 
celebrated Song of the Sea Miriam exclaims  שׁ ֶדֹקּ ַבּ ר ָדּ ְא ֶנ ה ָכֹמ ָכּ י ִמ ה ָוֹהְי ם ִל ֵא ָבּ ה ָכֹמ ָכ י ִמ
א ֶל ֶפ  ה ֵשֹׂע  ת ִה ְת  ה ָרוֹנ, “Who is like you, O Yahweh,  among the gods? Who is like 
you, glorious in holiness?8 Awesome in splendor, working wonders!” David and 
Solomon, both kings like Ammiditana, laud Yahweh similarly with statements in 
2 Sam 7:22 („ 1 Chron 17:20):  ֶת ָלוּז םי ִה ֱא ןי ֵא ְו וֹמ ָכּ ןי ֵא י ִכּ ה ָוֹה ְי  י ָנֹד ֲא  ָתּ ְל ַד ָגּ, “you are 
 
2  Compare the first person self-praise here with the same in the Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi (see 
W. G. Lambert, “The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi,” Or n.s. 36 [1967], 105–32, with plates VII–
XXIII for the most recent edition of the text). See also n.234 on page 59 of the general introduc-
tion for other references to the self-praise of deities. 
3  See Michael V. Fox, Proverbs 1–9: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (AB 18A; 
New York: Doubleday, 2000), 334–35 for a brief overview of representative scholars and criti-
cism of their positions. 
4  For a recent, spirited discussion of this issue (among many others), see William G. Dever, Did 
God Have a Wife? Archaeology and Folk Religion in Ancient Israel (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2005). 
5  It should be noted that the most common word for honey in BH, שׁ ַב ְדּ, is cognate to Akk. dišpu, 
despite the metathesis of the final two consonants. See Tawil, ALCBH, 72. 
6  Honey, of course, is not limited to sensual metaphors. The sweetness of honey is used in Ezek 
3:3 to describe the literal taste of the divine scroll Ezekiel ate and in Ps 119:103 as the basis of 
comparison to convey the surpassing sweetness of Yahweh’s word. 
7  For a study of divine incomparability in the ancient Near East and the Hebrew Bible generally, 
see  C.  J.  Labuschagne,  The  Incomparability  of  Yahweh  in  the  Old  Testament  (Leiden:  E.  J.  Brill,

gods  in  the  heavens  above  and  upon  the  earth  below.  .  .  .”  (It  is  notable  that 
both  royal  hymnic  statements  occur  in  the  context  of  petitionary  prayer.)  See 
also, for example, Pss 35:10, 71:19, 86:8, Jer 10:6–7, and Mic 7:18. Interesting-
ly,  the  incomparability  of  Yahweh—especially  as  compared  to  Mesopotamian 
gods—is a major theme in Second Isaiah, where, although humans do laud this 
divine attribute (see, e.g., 40:18), it is the deity himself who proclaims it most 
ardently (see, e.g., 40:25, 44:7, 45:21, and 46:5). 

וֹב ָיּ ַו

ה ָוֹהְי־ל ַ  ב ֵצּ ַי ְת ִה ְל  םי ִה ֱא ָה  י ֵנ ְבּ  וּא

Lines 25–40 of our hymn describe Ishtar’s position in the divine assembly. 
Since I present a brief comparative discussion of the divine assembly elsewhere 
in this volume (see Sin 1 on page 398), I focus here on one particular aspect that 
indicates a common representation in Israel and Mesopotamia of the hierarchy 
within it. In line 39 the hymn states that the gods appear before Ishtar and Anu, 
indicating thereby (and throughout the context) the pre-eminent position of the 
divine  couple  in  relation  to  all  of  the  other  deities  under  their  command  (see 
lines 26, 28, and 40). The Akk. word translated as “appear” in line 39 is an N 
stem  verb  with  an  ingressive  sense,  derived  from  i/uzuzzu,  “to  stand.”  This 
standing posture of the gods is in direct opposition to Ishtar’s being seated, de-
scribed in line 34. The very same notion of divine beings making an appearance 
or presenting themselves to a divine king occurs in the Hebrew Bible at Job 1:6 
and  2:1, where we read: 
,  “the gods entered  (the 
divine  court)  to  present  themselves  to  Yahweh.”  Notice  the  use  of  the  hitpael 
stem  of  בצי,  a  by-form  of  בצנ,  “to  stand.”  In  fact,  verbs  of standing  (especially 
דמע) are commonly used in BH to describe the posture of subordinates serving a 
superior, sometimes depicted as seated. A number of examples of servants stand-
ing  before  their  human  master  could  be  cited,9  but  the  most  relevant  text  for 
understanding the divine assembly is 1 Kgs 22:19 („ 2 Chron 18:18), where Mi-
caiah describes Yahweh’s throne room: ד ֵמֹע ם ִי ַמ ָשּׁ ַה א ָב ְצ־ל ָכ ְו וֹא ְס ִכּ־ל ַ ב ֵשֹׁי ה ָוֹהְי־ת ֶא י ִתי ִא ָר
וֹלאֹ מ ְשּׂ ִמוּ  וֹני ִמי ִמ  וי ָל ָ,  “I  saw  Yahweh  sitting  on  his  throne  and  the  entire  host  of 
heaven was standing before him, on his right and on his left.” The court discuss-
es  for  a moment  how  to  entrap  Ahab  in  battle.  And  then  in  v.  21  („  2  Chron 
18:20) a particular servant steps out from the throng to proffer the winning idea: 
ַוּר ָה  א ֵצ ֵיּ ַו,  “the  spirit  came  forward,  stood  before 
וּנּ ֶתּ ַפ ֲא  י ִנ ֲא  ר ֶמאֹ יּ ַו  ה ָוֹהְי  י ֵנ ְפ ִל  דֹמ ֲ ַיּ ַו 
Yahweh, and said, ‘I will deceive him.’” Isa 6:1–2 presents the very same image 
of a seated Yahweh with divine servants standing in attendance. As many others 
have  demonstrated,10  the  divine  assembly  is  a  common  mythological  idea 
throughout  the  ancient  Near  East  based  on  the  royal  court.  It  is  this  common 
human model that explains the mythological commonalities in the texts.

An Incantation-Prayer: Ghosts of My Family 1 

ALAN LENZI 

GHOSTS:  

Ancient Mesopotamians believed ghosts were the animating force in human 
bodies that (usually) continued to exist in the grave/netherworld  or elsewhere 
after  physical  death.  A  proper  burial,  i.e.,  interment,  was  necessary  for  a  per-
son’s  ghost  to  take  up  its  new  and  proper  residence  in the  grave/netherworld. 
Without  this  social  dignity,  they  might  be  condemned  to  roam  as  a  restless 
ghost—though there were other reasons a person became a restless ghost after 
death.1 Once the deceased was laid to rest, a cyclical ritual called kispu(m) had 
to be performed by a surviving relative (usually). This person was known as the 
pāqidu, “the one who attends to (it).” This rite included making funerary offer-
ings of various kinds of food (kispa kasāpu), pouring out libations of water (mê 
naqû), and invoking the deceased’s name as a memorial (šuma zakāru). The per-
formance of this rite was necessary to maintain the deceased’s ghost in the neth-
erworld. Without it, the ghost would have a miserable existence and could turn 
malevolent against humans. This rite did not, however, have to continue indefi-
nitely.  Rather,  after  a  generation  or  two—after  those  who  had  known  the  de-
ceased were themselves dead—a ghost would become part of the collective dead 
and no longer receive offerings as an individual. 

Ghosts were believed to have supra-human powers, somewhat like demons. 
They could act benevolently toward humans—thus the appeal in our prayer, but 
we  have  relatively  few  texts  that  seek  their  assistance.2  In  some  of  these,  the 
ghosts  are  asked to  assist  the  supplicant  with  the removal  of  a  certain  evil by 
handing  it  over  to  specific  denizens  of  the  netherworld  (as  in  our  prayer).  In 
others, we see the practice of necromancy, divination via the dead (see Finkel). 
Usually, however, ghosts were considered malevolent, bringing illness and other 
 
1  See Scurlock, “Ghosts and the Afterlife,” 1890 for a list of reasons people became ghosts. Anni-
hilation seems to have been the fate of those who were burned to death (see the final lines of 
Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld). 
2  See, e.g., Prescriptions 83–88 (pp. 343–63) in Scurlock’s dissertation.

misfortunes  upon  those  they  afflicted.  Many  rituals  were  developed  and  per-
formed by exorcists (āšipus) to treat these ghost-induced maladies.3 

THE PRAYER: 

This  incantation-prayer  is  embedded  in  a  larger  anti-witchcraft  ritual  that 
contains several other incantation-prayers.4 The incantation-prayers that precede 
ours  address  various  netherworld-related  beings,  such  as  the  Divine  River 
(Nāru), the Anunnakki, Shamash, and Gilgamesh, the latter two of which func-
tion as netherworld judges (see our line 7). The incantation-prayer that follows 
ours is addressed to the ghost of nobody (eṭem lā mammanama), represented by a 
skull  (gulgullu).5  A  very  close  parallel  to  our  incantation-prayer  appears  in  an 
incantation-prayer  to  Ishtar  and  Dumuzi.6  This  illustrates  how  incantation-
prayers were adopted into and adapted to different ritual contexts (see Farber, 
118). 

The  text  of  the  prayer  may  be  divided  thematically  into  the  three  typical 
parts  of  an  incantation-prayer:  the  invocation  (lines  1–4a),  the  petition  (lines 
4b–15,  17a),  and  the  promise  of  praise  (lines  16,  17b);  but  these  parts  are 
grammatically integrated into one another. That is, the first element in the peti-
tion section of the prayer (line 4b) completes the sentence begun in the invoca-
tion, and the two elements comprising the promise of praise are each dependent 
upon one of the last two petitions in the prayer: line 16 depends on line 15 and 
line 17b upon line 17a. Given this, the prayer’s brevity, and the fact that it lacks 
the  various  transitional  phrases  one  often  sees  in,  for  example,  the  shuilla-
prayers—transitions such as the self-presentation formula or the reiterated invo-
cation, the prayer reads very quickly and smoothly. Perhaps the one feature in 
the text of the prayer that creates a sense of disjunction between or  transition 
from  one  conceptual  part  to  another  is  the  use  of  first  person  verbal  forms  in 
lines 4b–6, which moves the prayer from invocation to petition,7 and the return 
of  these  first  person  verbs  starting  in  line  14,  which  moves  the  prayer  from  a 
predominance of petition to the lines containing its promise of praise. 

The invocation differs from many of the other prayers in this volume in that 
it does not extensively laud the beings invoked. The ghosts are not reminded of 
their attributes or cosmic position via a string of epithets at the beginning of this 
prayer. Rather, the invocation simply identifies—in multiple ways—to whom the 
prayer is directed: any and all family ghosts. I have suggested elsewhere that the 
 
3  See Scurlock, Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-Induced Illnesses and page 197 below. 
4  See  Ebeling,  TuL,  122–33  for  a  dated  textual  edition  of  the  ritual.  A  new  edition  will  soon 
appear in Abusch and Schwemer’s edition of the witchcraft corpus (see note i below). 
5  This incantation was treated in Scurlock’s dissertation as Prescription 87 (pp. 357–61). 
6  For  a  critical  edition  of the text,  see  Farber,  150–53.  Scurlock  also  treats  the  incantation  as 
Prescription 86 (pp. 354–57) in her dissertation. 
7  The disjunction created by the first person verbs in lines 4b–6 is heightened by the initial 2mp 
independent pronoun (attunu) and the anacoluthon that follows in the invocation.

dingirshadibba-prayers  have  very  brief  invocations  because  the  personal  god 
addressed in those prayers, unlike the high gods entreated in the shuilla-prayers, 
is familiar with the supplicant and already has a close personal relationship with 
him. One need not heap honorifics upon a deity one already knows well; but a 
god near the top of the divine hierarchy would have to be addressed with all due 
respect.8  The  same  reasoning  for  the  brief  invocation  of  the  present  prayer 
would seem to apply here as well.  

The invocation moves seamlessly into the petition section of the prayer. The 
first part of this section describes the supplicant’s preparatory actions (lines 4b–
6)  via  a  series  of  first  person  preterite  verbs.  Three  petitions  to  establish  the 
ghosts’ presence begin the petitions proper (lines 7–8). These are followed by a 
series of petitions in lines 9–15 and 17a that concern the supplicant’s affliction 
and recovery. 
Interlaced with the final two petitions of the prayer is the promise of praise 
 
(lines 16, 17b). The first promise, to libate cool water down the grave pipe, is 
specific to the ghostly audience of the prayer. The second is a stock phrase, ap-
parently added to our prayer mechanically (with a 2ms pronominal suffix rather 
than the expected 2mp).

Line 1: One of the witnesses to the prayer, LKA 89, preserves traces of the word ÉN = 
šiptu, “ritual wording, incantation,” which indicates to the user of the tablet that a prayer 
or incantation follows. GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost of a dead person.” Given the 2mp pronoun 
attunu,  “you,”  at  the  head  of  the  line in apposition  to  the  vocative  eṭemmu,  the  latter is 
certainly to be rendered as a collective, thus “ghosts.” Notice also the consonance between 
attunu and eṭem (the bound form of eṭemmu). Kimtu, “family.” One might consider render-
ing  eṭem  kimtīya  as  “my  ancestral  family”  (see  Abusch,  “Etemmu,”  309).  Bānû,  literally 
“builder,” but in the context of kinship is better rendered “begetter, progenitor” (also col-
lective). Qabru, “grave.” If the restoration at the end of the line is correct, the case ending 
should be understood as an adverbial accusative of  place. Line 1 begins a long anacolu-
thon, recognized as such only after the appearance of the words kispa aksipkunūši in line 4. 
 
    
Line 2: AD = abu, “father.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix, “my.” AMA = ummu, “moth-
er.” ŠEŠ = aḫu, “brother.” NIN = aḫātu, “sister.” Specific relatives are listed, thereby fur-
ther  defining  the  ghosts  addressed  by  the  prayer.  We  should  probably  assume  that  the 
bound form of the word for ghost, eṭem, has been elided from the head of the line but in 
fact governs all  of the nouns. The  nouns should therefore be  taken  as genitives (see the 
next line, where the oblique case form of the 1cs pronominal suffix is explicitly indicated). 
The repetition of abi and ummi, the similar sounding aḫi and aḫāti, and the six instances of 
the oblique 1cs pronominal suffix give the line a sing-song sound.

attunu eṭem kimtīya bānû qabra 

Line  3:  Nišūtu,  “kin,  relatives.”  Salātu,  “family,  clan.”  Again,  eṭem  has  been  elided 
from the head of the line but governs the nouns in the genitive. The prayer reverts back to 
collective kinship terms to designate the ghosts addressed. Notice how the 1cs pronominal 
suffixes on each feminine noun affect the phonological rhythm of the line.

6.    ú-ša[r]-riḫ-ku-nu-ši ú-ka[b-b]it-ku-nu-ši 
 
   
Line 4: Mala, “as much as, as many as.” Mala is an all-inclusive term, used to make 
sure no dead relative is left out (and thereby, in this case, offended). KI = erṣetu, “earth.” 
In a context that deals with the dead, however, erṣetu must mean “netherworld.” Although 
Akkadian lost mimation (final m) in the late OB period, some scholars prefer to read the 
phonetic complement that follows KI in our text as –tim, seeing in it a kind of frozen tradi-
tional orthography. Others prefer to indicate the loss of mimation explicitly by reading the 
same sign as –tì. This is generalizable so that some will read a final TUM, e.g., as tu4 while 
others  will  read it as  tum.  Regardless  of  the  convention  one adopts,  the  meaning  of  the 
word  is  not  affected.  Ṣalālu,  “to  sleep.”  Sleeping  is,  of  course,  a  very  common  way  of 
speaking about the state of the dead. In keeping with the plurality of address in the invo-
cation, the predicative ṣallū is 3mp. Kispa  kasāpu, “to offer a funerary offering” (cognate 
accusative).  The  preceding  kinship  nouns,  which  constitute  a  long  anacoluthon,  are  the 
referents of the dative pronominal suffix, –kunūši, “to you” (mp), on the verb here and on 
the next four verbs in lines 5 and 6. This suffix brings the text back conceptually to attunu 
in line 1. The 1cs verbs here and in lines 5 and 6 introduce the supplicant and describe the 
supplicant’s ritual actions. These actions, in tandem with the verbal invocation, attempt to 
get the ghosts’ attention. 
 
   
Line  5:  A.MEŠ  =  mû,  “water.”  Naqû,  “to  pour  out  (a  libation),  sacrifice.”  An actual 
libation would probably have accompanied this prayer. Liquids that were libated in ritual 
contexts included water, beer, wine, oil, honey, and milk among others. Only ghosts are 
offered  water  (see  Mayer,  UFBG,  152).  Kunnû,  “to  treat  kindly,  to  honor,”  and  the  two 
verbs in the following line are speech-acts (or performatives), the speaking of which exe-
cute their ritual action (i.e., “I hereby honor you”). All three verbs, which do not seem to 
refer  to  distinct  physical  acts,  probably  further  define  the  intention  of  the  libation:  the 
supplicant is preparing the deity to pay attention to the supplicant’s petitions. Both naqû 
and kunnû are commonly found in rituals honoring a superior, which includes deities and 
other non-obvious beings like dead ancestors (see CAD N/1, 337–38 and K, 541–42). No-
tice how consonance and assonance abounds in this line and the next. Though the repeat-
ed  2mp  pronominal  suffix  adds  to  these  phonological  features,  they  are  not  limited  to 
such. For example, both verbs are from weak roots containing an unvoiced velar consonant 
and an i theme-vowel. Also, the supplied object for the first verb, while balancing out the 
longer form of the second verb and thereby creating a symmetrical line in terms of sylla-
bles, also provides a nasal consonant (m) that resonates well with the n in the second verb. 
 
   
Line 6: Šurruḫu (D of šarāḫu), “to glorify, to give praise, to make splendid.” Kubbutu 
(D of kabātu), “to treat with honor, respect.” These two verbs are also frequently found in 
ritual  contexts  honoring a  superior.  For  other  contexts  that  use  both  verbs  together,  see

CAD  Š/2,  38. The  grammatical form  of the two strong verbs in this line—D preterites—
reinforces the line’s assonance.  
 
ušarriḫkunūši ukabbitkunūši 
   
Line 7:  UD = ūmu, “day.” Ina ūmi annî, literally, “on this day,” should be translated 
more  idiomatically.  IGI  =  maḫru,  “front,”  or  pānu,  “face”—both  are  possible.  The  term 
should be taken here as the equivalent of ina maḫri or ina pāni, “before.”  dUTU = Šamaš. 
Shamash is the sun god and god of justice (see page 197). dGIŠ.GÍN.MAŠ = Gilgameš. Gilga-
mesh takes on the role of a netherworld judge in some ritual texts (see, e.g., Maqlû I 38 
and the references in Parpola, LASEA 2, 204). Izuzzu, “to stand.” The ventive (–nim) on the 
imperative can be translated as “here.” Line 7 contains the supplicant’s first petition: they 
are invoking their ancestors in this prayer in order for the ancestors to stand on the suppli-
cant’s behalf before two  important judicial  deities  of the netherworld, Shamash and Gil-
gamesh.

Line 8: Dânu, “to judge.” Dīnī, “my case.” EŠ.BAR = purussû, “decision, verdict.” KUD 
=  parāsu,  literally,  “to  cut,  to  divide,”  but  in  this  legal  context  “to  decide.”  These  two 
verbs frequently occur together (see CAD P, 530–32 for some examples). This line contin-
ues the supplicant’s petition.  
 
dīnī dinā purussāya pursā 

mimma lemnu ša ina zumrīya šīrīya šerʾānīya bašû 

Line 9: NÍG ḪUL = mimma lemnu, “everything evil.” Rather than list all the suspected 
 
problems, the supplicant uses the most general terms possible. Besides ensuring coverage 
of  the  supplicant’s  own  problem,  this  manner  of  speaking  would  also  make  the  prayer 
suitable for any number of other people suffering from a wide variety of maladies. SU = 
zumru,  “body.”  UZU.MEŠ  =  šīrū,  “flesh.”  The  plural  form  does  not  change  the  meaning. 
SA.MEŠ  =  šerʾānū,  “sinews,  veins,  tendons,  muscles.”  GÁL  =  bašû,  “to  exist,  to  be.”  The 
form of the verb is probably a 3ms predicative (baši) plus subjunctive –u (but there are no 
syllabic spellings in the MSS to confirm this). Line 9 forms the object of the verb in line 10. 
 
   
Line 10: ŠU = qātu, “hand,” though a metaphorical rendering may be more appropri-
ate:  “power,”  “charge,”  or  “responsibility.”  dNAM.TAR  =  Namtar,  a  netherworld  deity, 
whose name means “fate.” SUKKAL = šukkallu (sukkallu), “a court official, minister, counse-
lor,” is in apposition to Namtar. Šukkallu is an epithet for many gods, although the noun 
that this term governs is typically a divine name (e.g., Ninshubur, šukallu of Anu; see CAD 
S, 358–59 for other examples). Here  the word  specifies Namtar’s position in the  nether-
world (erṣeti). Paqādu + ana, “to entrust, to hand over something to someone.” The sup-
plicant  makes  yet  another  petition  of  the  ancestral  ghosts,  but  this  is  the  first  one  that 
specifies their personal problem. They ask the ghosts to give the malady with which they

Line  11:  dNIN.GIŠ.ZI.DA  =  Ningizzida,  another  netherworld  deity.  GU.ZA.LÁ  =  guzalû, 
   
literally, “throne-bearer.” Like šukkallu, this word is an epithet for deities and demons and 
specifies Ningizzida’s position in the netherworld. DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “wide,” 
a common modifier of erṣeti when used of the netherworld (see CAD R, 162).  EN.NUN = 
maṣṣartu, “watch, guard, observation, security.” Dunnunu (D of danānu), literally, “to make 
strong, to  reinforce,” but with  maṣṣarta as the object, the  verb means  “to watch strictly, 
carefully” (see CAD M/1, 335). The 3mp pronominal suffix on the noun becomes the direct 
object of the verb in idiomatic English. The imperatives have given way to a precative in 
this line. This change is simply due to the fact that the agent of the verb, Ningizzida, is not 
being addressed by the speaker directly in this petition; an imperative would be inappro-
priate. 
 
   
Line 12: dBÍ.DU8  =  Bidu, a netherworld deity. There is some dispute about the proper 
reading of this god’s name. Some read the name as Nedu. Ì.DU8.GAL = idugallu, “chief gate-
keeper.” The meaning of this word is generally agreed upon, but the proper reading of the 
logogram and the precise Akkadian equivalent is unclear. (Compare Andrew George, “Sev-
en Words,” NABU 1991,  #19 [followed here],  CDA, 125,  s.v. idugallu, the entries of  the 
related term atû in both CAD A/2, 516–18 [note the reference to atūgallu on p. 518] and 
CDA, 31, and finally AEAD, 28, s.v. etūgallu. I thank Bob Whiting for providing a number 
of references with regard to this word.) Given the mention of a third party, Bidu, at the 
head of the line, we expect a precative main verb in this line, as in line 11, to continue the 
supplicant’s petitions. Scurlock (352) suggests līdil, “let him shut,” from edēlu, “to shut, to 
bolt.” An unpublished witness to this prayer replaces pānīšunu with EGIR-šú-[nu], arḫīšunu, 
“behind  them”  (see  Scurlock,  352).  Locking  a  gate  behind  someone  makes  sense  if  the 
guard  is  on  the  exterior  side  of  the  gate.  (For  example,  after a  person  exits a  restricted 
room, the guard in the hallway makes sure the door is locked behind them.) In Bidu’s case, 
he is on the interior of the netherworld, the place where the supplicant wants his affliction 
to go. Bidu guards the gate so no one can get out. It makes sense, therefore, to wish Bidu to 
lock  the  gate  in  front  of  a  recent  arrival  to  the  netherworld.  Upon  passing  through  the 
entrance to the netherworld, a person might wish to turn around and leave. But Bidu will 
not allow it; he locks the gate in front of them.

Line 13: DAB.MEŠ = Ṣubbutu (D of ṣabātu), “to seize.” The verb should be understood 
as  an  imperative  to  match  the  following  one.  Šūrudu  (Š  of  [w]arādu),  “to  cause  to  go 
down.” (The sign that comprises the first syllable of the verb is unclear on the tablet, but a 
ŠU sign fits the traces.) The prayer reverts to imperatives in its continuation of the petition

section. Oddly, the pronominal suffixes on the verbs are both 3ms despite the fact that all 
the previous suffixes are 3mp (but note line 9’s mimma lemnu). Although corruption in the 
transmission of the prayer is not out of the question (i.e., the NU sign dropped off the 3mp 
suffix –šunu, twice!), this explanation seems unlikely. Perhaps the supplicant assumes the 
problem  (singular)  has  been  identified  at  this  point  in  the  prayer  (?).  KUR.NU.GI4.A  = 
Kurnugi, literally, “the land of no return” (māt lā târi), “netherworld.” Notice the preposi-
tional phrase occurs at the end of the line. This is not typical syntax (compare lines 7 and 
10). This position may be explained in light of the double imperative: the text intends to 
align the actions of the two verbs closely, and since the location given in the prepositional 
phrase only makes sense in terms of the second verb, the prepositional phrase follows it. 
 
   
Line 14:  Anāku,  “I.”  ÌR =  ardu (wardum), “servant, slave.” Line 14 contains a stock 
phrase that usually occurs toward the end of prayers (see page 413 for an example in this 
volume and Mayer, UFBG, 282–83 for the generalization and exceptions). The word “serv-
ant” is a common way for a person addressing a social superior to demonstrate their lower 
social status. The same hierarchical logic operates with regard to a deity. Balāṭu, “to live, 
to be healthy.” Šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, to be(come) well, to be(come) whole.” The 
text turns emphatically—notice the independent pronoun at the head of the line—to the 
supplicant’s positive wishes for themselves. As in the previous lines of the petition, appro-
priate  volitional  forms,  here  precatives,  are  used  to  convey  that  which  is  desired.  First 
person forms, absent in the prayer since line 6, now dominate its remainder. 
 
   
Line 15: Aššu, “concerning, on account of, because of, with respect to.” NÍG.AK.A.MEŠ 
= upšaššû, “sorcery.” MU = šumu, “name,” though here something more metaphorical may 
be  better:  “reputation,  authority.”  Zakû,  “to  be  pure,  to  be  clear.”  Prepositions  like  aššu 
and  ina  can  be  difficult  to  translate.  Taking  their  range  of  meaning  into  consideration 
along with the other components in the line, provide an idiomatic rendering. What does it 
mean to be pure aššu sorcery ina the name of someone?  
 
   
Line 16: Arūtu, “clay pipe.” A pipe was inserted into a subterranean grave so the liv-
ing on the surface could pour libations through it to the deceased down below (as stated in 
line 5). Kaṣû, “cold.” Šaqû, “to give to drink, to water, to libate.” Lines 15 and 16 are bal-
anced  in  terms  of  length  and  show  several  grammatical  and  phonological  parallelisms. 
Notice, for example, that both lines open with a prepositional phrase and end with a prec-
ative  from  a  root  comprised  of  a  sibilant  and  velar  consonant.  Despite  the  grammatical 
parallelism, there is conceptual movement between the lines. What is unwanted, “sorcery,” 
occupies  the  same  position  in  line  15  as  that  which  will  benefit  from  removing  what is 
unwanted  in  line  16  (“pipe,”  which  stands  for  the  dead  ancestors).  The  transfer  of  the 
pronominal  suffix  –kunu  from  the  instrumental  prepositional  phrase  in  line  15  (ina

šumūkunu)  to  the  phrase  containing  the  object  of  the  supplicant’s  appreciation  (ana 
arūtīkunu) demonstrates the nature of the “deal” the supplicant is brokering in these final 
lines: “you do something for me, and I will do something for you.” The precative in this 
line, therefore, is not so much a wish as it is a promise to thank the deity for acting on the 
supplicant’s behalf (so also in line 17). Given the general trend of the Mesopotamian cli-
mate, cold drinking water would be particularly desirable. 
 
   
Line 17:  Bulluṭu  (D of  balāṭu), “to heal, to revive, to  spare, to provide support  for.” 
Bulliṭṭānnī-ma stands here for bulliṭānnī-ma. A direct imperative here, a kind of final plea, 
accentuates this line among those otherwise dominated by precatives (lines 14–17). Dalīlū, 
“praises.”  Dalālu,  “to  praise.”  The  two  form  a  cognate  accusative.  Dalīlīka  (2ms)  is  not 
expected here; rather, dalīlīkunu, “your (2mp) praises.” Given the ubiquity of the final two 
words of our prayer in Mesopotamian prayers generally, we may assume the scribe rather 
mechanically appended the well-known phrase in a grammatically incorrect manner. Line 
17b and its parallel in line 16b form the prayer’s concluding “promise of praise.”

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
Two issues stand out prominently in our prayer for comparative considera-
tion:  the issue  of benevolent ghosts  in  the  Hebrew  Bible  and  “honoring”  one’s 
deceased relatives.1  
 
Before  looking  at  these  two  issues  briefly,  it  is  important  to  consider  the 
idea  of  the  collective  dead  in  the  Hebrew  Bible.  According  to  some strands  of 
tradition, when a person died, they were “gathered to his people” (see, e.g., Gen 
25:8,  17,  35:29,  49:29,  33;  Num  20:24,  27:13;  etc.)  or  “to  his  ancestors”  (lit. 
“fathers”; Judg 2:10) and believed to “lie with his ancestors” (lit. “fathers”; see, 
e.g., 1 Kgs 1:21, 2:10, 11:21, 43, 14:20, 31, etc.). This manner of speaking about 
the dead shows a clear conceptual connection to the situation in our prayer, in 
 
1  Ancestor  worship  and  necromancy  in  the  Hebrew  Bible,  the  two  most  important  issues  that 
arise with regard to benevolent ghosts, have received considerable attention in the last several 
decades. A consensus seems to have crystallized around the idea that the ancient Israelites did 
practice some form of ancestor worship and did utilize necromancy, despite the biblical prohibi-
tions.  For  brief  overviews  with  literature,  see  Theodore  J.  Lewis,  “Ancestor  Worship,”  ABD 
1.240–42; Idem, “Dead,” DDD, 230–31; Idem, “Teraphim,” DDD, 844–50; J. Tropper, “Spirit of 
the Dead,” DDD, 806–09; and H. Rouillard, “Rephaim,” DDD, 692–00. See also the chapter enti-
tled “A Hidden Heritage: The Israelite Cult of the Dead” in Karel van der Toorn’s Family Religion 
in  Babylonia,  Syria,  and  Israel,  206–35  for  an  important  treatment;  for  an  archaeologically-
informed  presentation, see Elizabeth  Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs  about the 
Dead  (JSOTSup  123;  Sheffield:  JSOT  Press,  1992).  For  a  dissenting  view,  see  Brian  Schmidt, 
Israel’s  Beneficent  Dead:  Ancestor  Cult  and  Necromancy  in  Ancient  Israelite  Religion  and  Tradition 
(Freiburger  Altorientalische  Studien  11;  Tübingen:  J.C.B.  Mohr  [Paul  Siebeck],  1994;  repr. 
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1996).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

which the dead family members sleep together in the Netherworld, a mythologi-
cal notion that reflects the use of familial tombs/graves. Archaeological evidence 
from ancient Israel supports similar familial burial practices.2 
 
The clearest instance of a ghost in the Hebrew Bible is found in 1 Sam 28. In 
this passage Saul enlists the witch of Endor to conjure Samuel’s ghost in order to 
seek his guidance—an attempted necromancy (divination via  the dead).  Samu-
el’s apparition is called an םי ִה ֱא in v. 13, which probably indicates the ghost’s 
preternatural  powers.  Despite  Samuel’s  apparition  and  true  prediction  about 
Saul’s  fate,  the  Deuteronomistic  Historian,  in  line  with  the  Deuteronomic  con-
demnations  of  all  forms  of  necromancy  (Deut  18:9–11)  and  ancestor  worship 
(Deut  26:14),  presents  Saul’s  actions  in  a  negative  light.  This  condemnation 
along  with  many  other  negative  evaluations  of  such  practices  elsewhere  (e.g., 
Lev 19:26–28, 20:6, 27; 2 Kgs 21:6, 23:24; Isa 8:19–22 [it seems םי ִה ֱא and םי ִת ֵמ 
are used interchangeably here], 19:3 [making mention of םי ִטּ ִא, “ghosts,” which 
is  probably  cognate  to  Akk.  eṭemmu],  45:18–19,  57:6,  65:4;  and  Ezek  43:7–9) 
strongly  suggest  that  there  were  people  in  ancient  Israel  who  believed  in  the 
powers  of  the  beneficent  dead  and  engaged  in  various  death-related  rituals. 
(Why would one prohibit something if it were not occasionally practiced?) We 
do not, however, have any condoned instances in the Hebrew Bible of consulting 
the dead or seeking their aid, as in our Akkadian prayer.3 This absence has led 
some interpreters to the conclusion that the biblical author’s purged these popu-
lar-level practices from the official, normative form of Yahwism as presented in 
the Hebrew Bible.4  

In  the  context  of  our  prayer’s  description  of  a  post-mortem  provisioning 
(lines  4b–6),  the  supplicant  mentions  that  they  “honor”  their  deceased  family 
members. The verb used here is the D stem of kabātu. This verb is cognate to BH 
דבכ,  which  occurs  in  the  D  stem  in  the  Decalogue’s  command  to  honor  one’s 
father and mother ( ֶמּ ִא־ת ֶא ְו י ִב ָא־ת ֶא ד ֵבּ ַכּ; Exod 20:12, Deut 5:16; see similarly Mal 
1:6).  In  light  of  what  we  know  about  ancestor  veneration  in  ancient  Israelite 
popular religion, the importance of a proper burial, and the on-going importance 
of familial land and gravesites, it seems plausible to suggest that part of honor-
ing one’s parents, at least at some point in the commandment’s history, included 
observing  the  appropriate  post-mortem  funerary  rituals,  whatever  they  may 
have  been.5  But  such  rituals  are  not,  of  course,  the  same  thing  as  petitioning  a 
dead family member, as is done in our Akkadian prayer. 
 
2  See Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs about the Dead, passim. 
3  In fact, Job 14:21 and Qoh 9:4–6, 10 both present the dead as utterly impotent, ignorant, and 
unable to help the living. 
4  See, e.g., Lewis, “Ancestor Worship,” 242 and Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs 
about the Dead, 147.

An Incantation-Prayer: Girra 2 

CHARLES HALTON 

GIRRA:  

Girra  was the Mesopotamian god  of fire.  Starting in  the  Ur  III period  and 
continuing through the Old Babylonian period, the gods Girra and Gibil, another 
fire  god,  were  distinguished.  However,  by  the  Neo-Assyrian  period  the  gods 
merged and the names Girra and Gibil were used interchangeably to refer to the 
same  singular  deity.  Girra  was  written  logographically  in  Akkadian  as  dGIŠ.BAR 
and dBIL.GI. 

Girra  was  typically regarded  as  the  son  of  Anu  and  his  consort  Shala(sh). 
However,  he  was  occasionally  identified  as  the  son  of  Anu  and  Ki,  Ishkur  and 
Shala(sh),  or  as  a  son  of  Nusku.  His  lineage  made  him  a  middling  deity  with 
respect to rank in the pantheon; however, since he was the god of fire this ele-
vated  his  importance  within  literature  and  the  lives  of  Mesopotamians.  As  the 
agent of Nusku, Girra is mentioned as one of the occupants of Nusku’s temple in 
Nippur, É-me-lám-ḫuš, “House of Awesome Radiance.”1 

Fire is both an indispensible gift and a terrifyingly destructive force. Accord-
ingly, Mesopotamian literature reflects both of these aspects. For example, Gibil 
is mentioned in Enūma eliš as one of the fifty names of Marduk in which his crea-
tive ability and wisdom is celebrated:  

Gibil, the one who maintains the edge of the weapon, 
Who in combat with Tiamat created wonders, 
Who is vast of understanding, wise, and intelligent, 
Having a mind so wide that the gods in their assembly are not able  

to comprehend. (VII 115–118; my translation) 

On  the  other  hand,  Girra  also  had  a  fearsome  nature  which  is  illustrated  in  a 
poem praising Shalmaneser III’s campaign to Urartu that pairs Girra with Nergal, 
the god of the underworld, in an invocation: “Go, lord of kings! [ . . . ] May Ner-
gal go before you, Girra [after you . . .]” (SAA 11 17:28–29). Girra is an appro-
priate complement to Nergal since the poem celebrates the Assyrian king’s de-
struction  of  the  Urartian  army  and  line  9  states  that  the  city,  Til  Barsip,  was

tions 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993), #767.

burned.  The  order  of  the  invocation  is  as  logical  as  it  is  chilling:  Nergal  goes 
before Shalmaneser and kills all the people while Girra sweeps in and burns up 
the carnage. 

Finally,  the  so-called  Verse  Account  of  Nabonidus  contains  a  stylistically 
beautiful  line  composed  of  two  synonymously  parallel  stichoi  that  reflect  an 
identification of Girra with fire: 

 

 

Whatever he (Nabonidus) made, he (Cyrus) had Girra burn it up, 
Whatever he made, he had fire (išātu) consume it (vi 23ʹ–24ʹ).2 

Since Girra was the god of fire he was regarded as the patron deity of met-
alworkers. Also, he was acknowledged for his role in the construction of build-
ings by providing the means to bake bricks. Appropriately, his symbol was the 
torch. 

THE PRAYER:  

This incantation-prayer is a part of Maqlû, “burning,” an Akkadian magical 
series, consisting of eight incantation tablets (I–VIII) and one ritual tablet (IX), 
that was performed at the end of the month Abu to combat illegitimate witches 
and witchcraft. The first eight tablets contain almost one hundred incantations. 
Tablet  IX  lists  the  incantations  according  to  their  opening  words  (incipit)  and 
describes  the  proper  rituals  to  employ  with  each.  An  exorcist  led  the  incanta-
tions and associated rituals which emphasize the innocence of the supplicant as 
well as their inability to counteract their enemy. The ceremony was performed 
at  the  supplicant’s  home  and  began  at  night  and  was  continued  the  following 
morning. Although the ceremony was complex we may break it down into three 
main parts: summoning the gods, cleansing the patient’s bedroom, and perform-
ing ceremonial washings the following morning.3  

The incantation-prayer to Girra occurs in the first part of the ritual in Tablet 
II, lines 76–103. Our text begins with  a brief hymnic introduction that praises 
Girra’s ability to guide the divine council toward right verdicts (lines 1–9). After 
the  hymn  is  the  petition  section  of  the  prayer  (lines  10–24).  It  begins  with  a 
standard self-presentation formula (line 10) and then follows a typical sequence. 
In the first section the supplicant’s situation is described in the form of a lament 
(lines 11–13). The second part contains ritual actions involving figurines (lines 
15–17) followed by the recitation of several petitions (lines 18–21, 23), which 
marks  the  end  of  the  petition  section.  Finally,  the  prayer  is  concluded  with

Ә AN INCANTATION-PRAYER: GIRRA 2 

147

The petition portion of the prayer repeats invocations in order to transition 
between  elements  of  the  prayer  as  well  as  to  give  the  composition  a  sense  of 
unity  and  coherence. Line 14 provides a bridge between the lament and ritual 
segments by contrasting the “exalted” (šurbû) and “holy” (ellu) attributes of Girra 
with the wretched description of the supplicant in the lament section. Similarly, 
the last invocation (line 22) transitions between the precative petitions and the 
direct, imperatival petitions in lines 23 and 24 by addressing Girra as “magnifi-
cent” (šarḫu) and “eminent among the gods” (ṣīru ša ilī).  

This prayer contains many poetic features. For instance, lines 18–21 promi-
nently use repetition and consonance. Each line has the same format: šunu fol-
lowed by a precative, then anāku followed by a precative. Furthermore, some of 
the lines show alliteration between the two verbs. For example, limūtū and lubluṭ 
(line 18) both contain dental and labial consonants (t=ṭ and m~b). Lastly, the 
pronouns in this section are emphatic and highlight the petitioner’s request that 
Girra intervene and punish the supplicant’s enemies while causing the supplicant 
to flourish.

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of 
the prayer. It is not a part of the prayer itself. dGIŠ.BAR = Girra. Āriru, “burning one.” The 
adj.  āriru  is  used  elsewhere  to  describe a  blazing  fire  or a  burning  lamp  (see  CAD  A/2, 
268). Bukur is the construct state of bukru, “son.” It is common for invocations to include 
genealogical information for summoned deities. 
 
   
Line 2: Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” Dīnu, “judgment, decision, legal case.” Dīna dânu 
means “to render a verdict.” KA = atmû (atwûm), “speech, word” (see CAD P, 399). Pirištu, 
“secret.”  Attā,  “you.”  Shamash  is  the  deity  most  commonly  associated  with  judging  / 
judgment since he looked down on the world (and underworld during the night) and saw 
all of humankind’s deeds. However, when petitioners prayed to a specific deity for help 
their prayers usually included a request for the deity to render a judgement on their be-
half. For an extensive treatment of the topic of divine secrecy, see Alan Lenzi, Secrecy and 
the  Gods:  Secret  Knowledge  in  Ancient  Mesopotamia  and  Biblical  Israel  (SAAS  19;  Helsinki: 
The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2008). Our line is treated briefly on p. 84, n.99. 
 
   
Line 3: Iklēti (ekletu), “darkness.” Šunammuru (ŠD of namāru [nawārum]), “to shine, to 
illuminate.” The form is a 2ms durative. This is a very appropriate description given Gir-
ra’s connection with fire. 
 
   
Line  4:  Ešâti  is  a  fp  from  ešû,  “confused.”  Likewise,  dalḫāti  from  dalhu,  “mixed  up, 
perplexed.” Tušteššir is a 2ms Št-lexical durative from ešēru. We could normalize this verb 
in accordance with the expected i-vowel that is often colored by the following r so that it 
becomes e (Huehnergard §36.1), which would yield tušteššer. The Št-lexical of ešēru means 
“to put and keep in order, to straighten, to set aright.” This verb is commonly used in in-
vocations  of  and  petitions  to  deities  that  they  might  “clear  up  confusion”  and  “provide 
justice” (see CAD E, 361 and Tawil, ALCBH, 151–52). Superficially, this line is a descrip-
tion  of  the  deity’s  character;  however,  it  could also  be  seen as an  implicit  plea  that  the 
deity act in accordance with this confession. This prayer contains many lines that function 
similarly (see, e.g., line 25). 
 
   
Line 5: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” GAL = rabû, “great.” EŠ.BAR = purussû, “decision.” The –a 
after the logogram is a phonetic complement, indicating the accusative case. Nadānu, “to 
give.”  In  the  form,  tanamdin,  –dd–  dissimilates  to  –md–.  Here  nadānu  used  with  purussû

means “to make a decision,” but in other contexts it can also mean “to give an oracle” (see 
CAD N/1, 54). Lines 5–7 describe Girra’s pivotal role in divine decision making. Since the 
petitioner  is  seeking  divine adjudication  of  their  situation,  they  hope  Girra  will  take  up 
their cause and persuade the other gods to act on their behalf. 
 
   
Line 6: Kâta is the genitive/accusative form of the 2ms independent pronoun. Mam-
man, “somebody, anybody.” Parāsu, “to separate, to decide.” There is a variant reading of 
this  line  which  inserts the  expected  lā  after  the  first sign to  yield  the  idiom,  ša  lā  X  = 
“without X.”  
 
   
munication.” 
 
   
Line  8:  Epēšu,  “to  do.”  Lumnu,  “evil,  misery.”  Arḫiš,  “quickly.”  Kamû,  “to  capture, 
bind.” Maqlû does not only allow the supplicant to pray for relief from the evil spell that is 
afflicting them; the ritual also includes vengeance against the person who commissioned 
the  magic.  Therefore,  lines  8  and  9  highlight  the  aspects  of  Girra’s  actions  that  include 
quickly capturing and overtaking the enemy.  
 

Line 7:  Ûrtu  (wuʾʾurtu),  “instruction, command.” Ṭēmu, “order,  decree; reason; com-

Line 9: Lemnu, “bad, wicked.”  Ayyābu (see ajābu in CAD and ajjābu in AHw), “ene-

 
my.” Kašādu, “to reach, to overcome.” 
 
   
Line  10:  Anāku,  “I.”  NENNI  =  annanna  (fs,  annannītu),  “so-and-so.”  DUMU  =  māru, 
“son.” This pronoun is used as a  placeholder; during the incantation the officiant would 
insert the name of the supplicant here. This line transitions from the hymnic invocations, 
which describe various attributes of Girra, to the petition section of the prayer (lines 11–
24), where the supplicant begins with a description of their predicament. 
 
   
Line  11:  The  transliterations  and  normalizations  for  lines  11–13  are  from  Abusch 
(Mesopotamian Magic, 86, n.9). Kišpu, “sorcery, evil spell.” Lupputāku is a 1cs predicative of 
lupputu (D of lapātu), “to afflict, to touch.” Izuzzu (uzuzzu), “to stand, to serve.” Lines 11–

13  are  similar  in  form:  the  first  cola  uses  a  predicative  verb  to  lament  the  supplicant’s 
cursed condition, while the second uses a preterite to describe their presence before the 
deity. Mayer (UFBG, 122–45) describes the action in the second half of these cola as Hin-
wendung, the “turning.” 
 
   
Line 12:  Abusch (“Witchcraft and the  Anger of the  Personal God,” 86, n.9) notes a 
variant to this line: ina pān ili u amēli šuzzurākū-ma elīka x / allaka ana maḫrīka, “detestable 
before god and man to you . . . I come in front of you.” IGI = pānu, “face,” though it could 
also stand for maḫru, “front.” Ina pān(i)/maḫar  means, “in the presence of.” LÚ = amīlu 
(awīlum), “a man, a human being.” Šuzzuru (Š of nazāru), “to make detestable, to curse” 
(see CAD N/2, 140, under 4. III). The form here is a 1cs predicative, which literally means 
“I am made detestable.” Eli, “on, over, above, to, towards.”

eli āmerīya marṣākū-ma šapalka akmis 
   
Line  14:  Šurbû,  “exalted,  supreme.”  Ellu,  “pure,  holy.”  In  contrast  to  the  previous 
three lines that describe the supplicant’s lowly condition, this line portrays Girra as exalted 
and undefiled. The descriptives in this line all have –u endings and the words, ilu ellu, are 
similar in sound.  
 
   
 

Line 15: Eninna = inanna, “now.” Ilūtu, “divinity,” is the abstract form of ilu, “god.” 
eninna ina maḫar ilūtīka rabîti

Girra šurbû ilu ellu 

   
Line 16: NU = ṣalmu, “image, figurine, statue.” Kaššāpu, “sorcerer, warlock;” kaššaptu, 
“witch.”  LÚ and  MUNUS are determinatives indicating, redundantly, the gender of the fol-
lowing nouns.  ZABAR = sipparu, “bronze.” Qātukka is qātu, “hand; power; authority,” the 
locative-adverbial ending –um, plus the 2ms pronominal suffix. The m assimilates to the k 
of the suffix (see GAG Paradigm 5). The –um suffix corresponds to prepositional phrases in 
which  a  genitive  is  proceeded  by  the  prepositions  ina  or  ana  (see  GAG  §66);  thus,  this 
phrase is translated “in your hand/power.” The statues described here were burned during 
the recitation of this incantation. Afterward, the figures were trampled in water and their 
remains buried (Abusch, “An Early Form of the Witchcraft Ritual Maqlû,” 123).

Line 17: Ugguru (D of egēru, “to twist”). Twisting the feet of statues was part of the Bīt 
rimki rituals directed to Shamash (see J. A. Scurlock, “KAR 267//BMS 53: A Ghostly Light 
on bīt rimki?,” JAOS 108.2 [1998], 203–4; see also CAD E, 42). However, the verb in the 
Bīt  rimki  ritual  (tuzār  from  zâru,  CAD  Z,  72)  is  different  from  that  found  in this  prayer. 
Foster translates this line as “I have made crossed marks(?) upon them” (661) and specu-
lates that the action of twisting refers to making cross marks on the statues. Kâša is the 
dative  form  of  the  2ms  independent  pronoun  (GAG  §41f).  The  verb  paqādu,  “to  assign, 
entrust,” contains an accusative 2ms pronominal suffix and likely refers to the statue while 
the independent pronoun refers to the deity. The context surrounding the verb apqid indi-
cates that it should be interpreted as a performative (for more on the performative in Se-
mitic languages, see F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, “(More) On Performatives in Semitic,” ZAH 17–
20 (2004–2007), 36–81. For a discusion of this within Akkadian see GAG §79b and 80c. 
Regardless of precisely what is done to the statue, the ritual intends to bring harm to the 
person that cursed the patient.  
 
   
Line 18: Šunu, “they.” Mâtu, “to die.” Balāṭu, “to live, to recover.” See the introduc-
tion to the prayer above for a discussion of the structure and poetic features of lines 18–
21. The content of these lines reveals the intention behind the ritual in line 17. The peti-
tioner asks Girra to reverse the effects of the curse against them and allow them to heal, 
while the person who brought the curse in the first place has a time of suffering. 
 
    
Line 19:  Ešēru,  “to be  straight, to be right.”  The first half of this line is  difficult  to 
interpret. The verb should be read either as liddappirū-ma (Tzvi Abusch, personal commu-
nication) from  duppuru,  “to  drive  away,  expel,”  or as  litebbirū-ma  from  abāru,  “to  bind.”  
From the pattern in lines 18, 20–21 of antithetical parallelism, we can assume that the first 
half of the  line conveys the opposite sense  of the second; however,  ešēru is semantically 
flexible, which makes the interpretation of this line more difficult.

Line 22: Šarḫu, “proud, magnificent.” Ṣīru, “outstanding, eminent.” This line reprises 
the invocations in lines 1 and 14. The first three words of the phrase, šarḫu ṣīru ša ilī, all 
begin with sibilants and the first two words both have r and u sounds. 
 
    
Line 23: Kašādu, “to defeat, to overtake.” In kušussunūtī-ma (G imperative of kašādu) 
the d of kašādu assimilates into the š of the accusative 3mp suffix to form –ss– (GAG §30f 
and §65b). Naḫbulu (N of ḫabālu), “to wrong, to oppress” (see CAD Ḫ, 6 for a note on this 
word’s complicated semantic range). Lines 23 and  24 cluster words that begin with  k,  l, 
and a sounds to create a sense of excitement before the unit in lines 25–27. 
 
    
Line 24:  ÌR  =  ardu (wardum), “servant.” Izuzzu, see line  11. This line is a common 
trope in which the supplicant promises to praise and serve the god/goddess should he/she 
heal the sufferer; see Tzvi Abusch, “The Promise to Praise the God in Šuilla Prayers,” in 
Biblical and Oriental Essays in Memory of Wiliam L. Moran (ed. Agustinus Gianto; BibOr 48; 
Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 2005), 5. 
 
    
Line 25: MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. Bēlu, “lord.” The use of –ma puts focus on the 
personal pronoun, “you (and not some other deity) are my god” (see GAG §123a). Lines 
25–27 comprise a structural unit; the lines are bound together with the repetition of attā-
ma. Lines 25 and 26 each consist of two phrases two words in length beginning with attā-
ma. The two lines build to a crecendo into line 27, which again begins with attā-ma but is 
one long line instead of two short clauses. The first two lines confess fidelity to the deity 
and recognize his ability to help the petitioner. The final line is framed as a description of 
the deity, yet it is a veiled plea for the deity to rise up and act in accordance with the con-
fession, “You are the one restoring my fortune.”  
 
    
sibly the line below has influenced the choice of the suffix.  
 

Line 26: Dayyānu “judge.” Rēṣu, “helper, supporter.” We would expect rēṣī here; pos-

Line 27:  Gimillu, “kindness, favor; vengeance.” Turru (D of târu, “to return”) gimilla, 
“to return an act  of kindness; to wreak vengeance”  (see CAD G, 74). The logograms  TU6

Line 28: The rubric, typically written in Sumerian, identifies the kind of incantation-

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
Several phrases and words within the prayer to Girra are similar in structure 
and meaning to biblical analogues. For instance, in line 24 the phrase maḫarka 
luzziz literally means, “may I stand before you”; however, just like the analogous 
phrase in BH, 
, it is used idiomatically to indicate service to an official or 
deity (HALOT, 841). For example, Num 16:9 “Does it seem too small a thing to 
you that the god of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel…to 
perform the service (ת ַדֹב ֲ־ת ֶא  דֹב ֲ ַל) of Yahweh’s tabernacle and to stand before 
(י ֵנ ְפ ִל דֹמ ֲ ַל ְו) the community to minister to them (ם ָת ְר ָשׁ ְל)?” 

י ֵנ ְפ ִל ד

 מע

 ְנ ִשׂא

בוֹט וּב ֱה ֶא ְו ע ָר־וּ

This prayer also contains poetic features that are similar to those employed 
by biblical writers. For instance, lines 18–21 cluster antonym word pairs within 
the same line: die | live „ bind | straight „ expire | flourish „ weak | strong. Ex-
amples of biblical passages with similar structure include Amos 5:15, “Hate evil 
and love good” (
) and Psalm 107:26, “They went up to the sky / 
they went down to the depths” (תוֹמוֹה ְת).1  
 
In addition to sharing certain poetic features, the psalmists and the author 
of this prayer to Girra use similar divine titles and descriptions. In Ps 40:18b and 
the parallel passage in Ps 70:6b the psalmist confesses, “You are my help (Ps 40, 
י ִת ָר ְז ֶ; Ps 70, י ִר ְז ֶ) and my deliverer,” which is semantically similar to line 26 in 
the prayer to Girra: “you are my helper” (rēṣūya). Of course confessions such as 
“you  are my god”  and  “you  are my lord”  in line  25  are  quite  common  within 
biblical literature (e.g., Ps 63:2: “O Elohim, (you are) my god, I search for you,” 
; and Ps 16:2: “I said to Yahweh, ‘You are my lord,’”  י ִתּ ְר ַמ ָא

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

 
Even though the Bible does not contain apotropaic rituals to counter witch-
craft, it does recount rituals that contain curses. When individuals or communi-
ties  concluded  a  covenant,  curses  were  invoked  upon  whomever  violated  the 
agreement (e.g., Exod 24). Sometimes biblical writers linked times of adversity 
with  these  curses.  For  instance,  the  Chronicler  asserts  that  the  land  finally  re-
ceived  its  sabbath  rest  because  Yahweh  invoked  the  curse  of  exile  (2  Chron 
36:21; see Lev 25:4, 26:34; Jer 29:10). Instead of a declaration of innocence and 
a specific ritual to ward off curses as seen in the prayer to Girra, biblical writers 
prescribed confession of sin and repentance to reverse the effects of curses asso-
ciated with oaths (e.g., Lev 26:40).  

Numbers 5:11–31 describes a curse embedded within a ritual used when a 
man suspected that his wife committed adultery. In these instances the husband 
would bring his wife before a priest. The priest mixed dust from the tabernacle 
floor  with  holy  water,  and  the  woman  took  an  oath  denying  that  she  had  an 
adulterous encounter. After this, the priest wrote curses on a scroll and washed 
the  ink  off  into  the  water  and  dust  mixture.  He  then  gave  the  mixture  to  the 
woman to drink. Presumably, an innocent woman would be unharmed while a 
guilty one would suffer the curses she imbibed.3  
 
3  This ritual contains several layers of meaning. For a discussion of the various communicative 
dimensions, see Gerald A. Klingbeil, Bridging the Gap: Ritual and Ritual Texts in the Bible (IBRSup 
1; Winona Lake, Eisenbrauns, 2007), 212–14, and for a literary and contextual treatment of this 
ritual, see Richard M. Davidson, Flame of Yahweh: Sexuality in the Old Testament (Peabody: Hen-
drickson, 2007), 349–54.

An Incantation-Prayer: Gods of the Night 1 

TZVI ABUSCH 

GODS OF THE NIGHT: 

See page 71. 

THE PRAYER:  

Context: This address to the gods of the night is the first incantation-prayer 
 
in the magical series Maqlû, “burning.” Maqlû is the longest and most important 
Mesopotamian  text  concerned  with  combating  witchcraft.  This  composition 
comprises eight tablets of incantations and a ritual tablet. The incantation tab-
lets record the text of almost one hundred incantations directed against witches 
and witchcraft; in the ritual  tablet, these incantations are cited by incipit, and 
alongside each citation appropriate ritual directions are prescribed. Long thought 
to be a random collection of witchcraft materials, an important breakthrough in 
the understanding of Maqlû came with the discovery that it was a single complex 
ceremony. This ceremony was performed during a single night and into the fol-
lowing morning at the end of the month Abu (July/August).1  

But the present text of Maqlû stands at the end of a long and complex liter-
ary and ceremonial development. An earlier version of the ceremony would have 
been  performed  in  the  daytime  and  would  have  begun  with  what  is  now  the 
sixth incantation (I 73ff.), which was originally addressed to Shamash. After the 
ceremony was transferred to the nighttime, the present introductory section, I 1–
72, was added. In line with its new ceremonial context, this section now opens 
with the address to the gods of the night. This opening section is an indictment 
of the witch. The incantation-prayer draws together magical and legal imagery 
 
1  For the nature of Maqlû, see I. T. Abusch, “Mesopotamian Anti-Witchcraft Literature: Texts and 
Studies. Part 1: The Nature of Maqlû: Its Character, Divisions and Calendrical Setting,” JNES 33 
(1974), 251–62; repr. in Tzvi Abusch, Mesopotamian Witchcraft (Ancient Magic and Divination 5; 
Leiden: Brill, 2002), 99–111. For its history, see idem, “An Early Form of the Witchcraft Ritual

Ancient Near Eastern Literature in Honor of William L. Moran (ed. T. Abusch, et al; HSS 37; Atlanta: 
Scholars Press, 1990), 1–57; repr. in Abusch, Mesopotamian Witchcraft, 113–62.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

for  this  purpose.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  this  incantation-prayer  is  not  a 
simple  prayer  in  which  a  stable  negative  situation  is  described  and  a  change 
asked  for.  Rather,  it  is  a  speech  that  accompanies  a  ritual  act  and  gives  ex-
pression to a dynamic situation. The text thus reflects the changes in state un-
dergone by the patient and the witch from the beginning of the ritual to its end. 
It is possible that an earlier form of this text ended with line 20 and that lines 
21–35 represent an innovation. 

Structure: The incantation-prayer is in the form of a speech in the first per-
son made by the patient, who invokes the heavenly gods of Anu (lines 1–3). The 
patient first presents his plaint in the form of a description of the acts that the 
witch performed against him and of the resultant state (lines 4–12). On this ba-
sis, the patient asks the gods to take up his case (lines 13–14). The patient pro-
claims that he has caused the accused witch to be present in the judgment in the 
form  of  figurines  of  male  and  female  witches  (lines  15–17)  and  asks  that  the 
witch  be  punished  for  having  sought—perhaps  by  means  of  accusations—
unmotivated  evil  against  the  patient  and  that  the  witch’s  bewitchment  be  re-
leased  (lines  18–20).  The  patient  asks  to  be  cleared  (of  bewitchment  and  any 
imputed guilt) by means of a standard set of plants—these plants usually serve 
to  purify,  but  here  they  function  as  (an  oath  and)  a  form  of  juridical  ordeal 
(lines 21–24). The patient, having proven his innocence and having been cleared 
(lines 25–26), is now able to assert that since the witch’s utterance belongs to an 
evil witch, her accusation has been refuted (lines 27–28), and to ask the gods of 
the night to bring the witch to justice and indict her, and the night watches to 
release  the  witchcraft  (lines  29–30).  By  means  of  a  magical  identification  and 
act, the patient expresses the wish that the organs of speech of the witch be de-
stroyed (lines 31–33). Finally, he asserts that the witch’s actions and accusations 
have been wholly nullified (lines 34–35) by the gods of the night (line 36).

Lines 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This superscript marks the begin-
ning of the ritual wording; it is not part of the prayer. Šasû, “to call.” The form alsīkunūši is 
a 1cs preterite plus 2mp dative suffix, which functions here as an accusative. The preterite 
forms of šasû in lines 1–3 are examples of performative preterites and should be translated 
“I call.” DINGIR.MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Mušītu, “night.”

Line 4: This line describes the actions of the witch; line 5, her utterances. Line 4 re-
fers to the witch’s act of silencing the victim (=speaker); line 5 refers to the witch’s act of 
leveling an accusation against the victim. Aššu, “because,” at the beginning of line 4 gov-
erns lines 4–12; hence, the verbs in these lines are in the subjunctive (in this context note 
amruṣu in line 7) and are singular, not plural. MUNUS.UŠ11.ZU = kaššaptu, “witch.” Kuššupu 
(D of kašāpu), “to bewitch.” The form ukaššipanni is a 3cs preterite plus a 1cs accusative 
pronominal suffix (so also the verb in line 5).

Line 6:  DINGIR.MU =  ilī, “my god.” Ištarī, “my goddess.” Šussû (Š of  nesû), “to drive 
away, to cause to be estranged.” The 3cs preterite is normally ušassi; ušassû adds the sub-
junctive –u. UGU.MU = elīya, “from, upon me.” 
 

Line 2: Itti, “with,” bears a 2mp pronominal suffix. Kallatu, “bride.” Kuttumtu, “veiled,

Line 7: Amāru, “to see.” The participle is used substantively and bears a 1cs pronomi-
nal suffix. Marāṣu, “to be(come) ill, sickening.” Amruṣu: so in one Nineveh MS. Other Nine-
veh MSS read am-ru-uṣ. 
 
   
Line  8:  Emēdu,  “to  beset  (with).”  The  form  is  a  1cs  predicative;  the  speaker  is  the 
subject  of  this  passive  construction  (this  subject  would  have  been  the  first  object  in  an 
active  construction),  and  lā  ṣalālu,  “not  sleeping,”  is  the  object  (it  would  have  been  the 
second object in an active construction).  GI6 = mūšu, “night.” Mūša and urra are accusa-
tives of time.

Line 9: Qû, lit. “thread, string,” but here “gag.” Mitallû (Gtn of malû), “to fill continu-

 
ally.” The form is a 3cs durative with subjunctive. KA = pû, “mouth.” 
 
   
Line 10:  Upuntu (upumtu), a type of flour, here stands for food in general.  KA.MU = 
pīya (see line 9). Parāsu, “to block, to keep distant.” The verb is a 3cs preterite with sub-
junctive; qû from line 9 is the subject.

elēlī nubû ḫidûtī sipdi 

Line 12: Elēlu, “cheerful song.” Nubû, “lament, wailing.” Ḫidûtu, “joy, rejoicing.” Sipdu, 

   
“wailing, mourning.” 
 
   
Line 13: Izuzzu, “to stand”; here izuzzu connotes participation in a judicial proceed-
ing. The form is a cp impv. with 1cs dative pronominal suffix.  DINGIR.MEŠ  GAL.MEŠ = ilū 
rabûtu, “great gods.” Šemû, “to hear,”  is  also  in  the form of a cp impv. Dabābu, “to speak.”

The inf. with 1cs pronominal suffix is functioning nominally; thus, “my speaking,” which 
denotes here the supplicant’s legal case against the witch. 
 
   
Line  14:  Dīnu,  “legal  case.”  Dânu  (diānu),  “to  judge.”  Alaktu  here  has  the  meaning 
“(oracular)  decision.”  Alaktu,  from  alāku,  “to  go,”  refers  to  the  movements  of  heavenly 
bodies. Lamādu normally means “to learn, to come to know,” but in this context the verb 
has a revelatory connotation.  The phrase dīnī  dīnā  alaktī  limdā here is equivalent to  dīnī 
dīnā purussâya pursā, “judge my case, give a decision.” See T. Abusch, “Alaktu and Hala-
khah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 (1987), 15–42.

perhaps in some instances, just “sorceress.” Ēpišu is sometimes coupled with ēpištu. 
 
   
Line 17: Šakānu, “to set, to place.” The performative preterite here has the force of a 
punctual  present,  “I  set  (it).”  Ina  šapli  idiomatically  means  “at  the  feet  (of).”  The  noun 
bears a 2mp pronominal suffix. The durative adabbub has the force of a durative present, “I 
am (now) pleading.”  
 
   
Line 18: Aššu, see line 4. Epēšu, “to perform” here. The witch is the subject; the sup-
plicant is the referent of the 1cs dative suffix (–am, with loss of final m, –a). Lemnu, “evil.” 
Šiteʾʾû (Gtn of šeʾû), “to seek constantly.” The form is a 3cs preterite with a 1cs dative pro-
nominal suffix. Banû, “good.” Both adjectives are fem. pl. 
 
    
Line 19: Šī, “she.” Mâtu, “to die.”  Anāku, “I.” Balāṭu, “to live, to be well.” Both verbs 
are precative: the first is 3cs, referring to the supplicant’s wish for the witch; the second is 
1cs, referring to the supplicant’s desire for himself.  
 

Line 15:  Epēšu, “to do, to  make.” The form is a 1cs preterite.  NU =  ṣalmu, “image,

Line  20:  Kišpū  (usually  plural),  ruḫû,  and  rusû  are  all  words  referring  to  sorcery. 
Pašāru,  “to  release.”  Lū  pašrū  is  a  precative  in  lū,  “may,  let,”  plus  the  3mp  predicative 
form. It is possible that this construction is an asseverative: “verily are her witchcraft . . . 
released.” 
 
   
Line 21: The main verbs in lines 21–24 are all precatives with a 1cs pronominal accu-
sative suffix; each initial half of the line names a plant and is followed by the precative 
verb, indicating the supplicant’s wish for what the plant should do to him. GIŠ.ŠINIG = bīnu, 
“tamarisk.”  Ullulu  (D  of  elēlu),  “to  clear.”  The  relative  clause  introduced  by  ša  modifies 
tamarisk.  Qimmatu, “crown,” here is an accusative of respect. Šarû,  “to  be copious,” is a 
3ms predicative with subjunctive. 
bīnu lillilanni ša qimmatu šarû 
 
   
Line  22:  GIŠ.GIŠIMMAR  =  gišimmaru,  “date-palm,”  is  feminine  here  (see  māḫirat). 
Pašāru, see line 20. Lipšuranni is a 3cs precative plus a 1cs accusative suffix. Māḫirat is a fs 
participle in construct from maḫāru, “to withstand,” it modifies date-palm. Kalû, “all, total-
ity.” IM = šāru, “wind.” 

kišpūša ruḫûša rusûša lū pašrū 

gišimmaru lipšuranni māḫirat kalû šāri 

maštakal libbibanni ša erṣeti malâta 

   
Line 23: Ú.IN.NU.UŠ = maštakal, “soapwort,” is feminine here (see malâta). Ubbubu (D 
of ebēbu), “to cleanse.” KI-tì = erṣeti, “earth.” Malû, “to be(come) full, to fill.” Malâta is a 
3fs transitive parsāku form. Both here and in line 24 malâta is in the subjunctive.  
 
   
Line 24: GIŠ.ŠE.Ù.SUḪ5 = terinnatu, “cone,” is usually understood as the plural of terin-
nu  and  transcribed  terinnātu,  but  note  here  the  singular  verb  form  malâta.  In  this  line, 
malâta  is  intransitive.  ŠE.AM  =  šeʾu,  “grain,”  indicates  the  seeds  with  which  the  cone  is 
filled. 
 
   
Line 25: Ina maḫri, “before, in the presence of.” Elēlu, “to be(come) pure.” The verbs 
ētelil, ētebib, and azzaku in lines 25–26 are in the perfect, indicating that the state of clean-
liness or innocence described has now been achieved as a result of the wishes of the previ-

fect assimilates to the z of the root (–zt– becomes –zz–). Lardu, “nard.” 
 
   
Line  27:  Tû,  “spell,  incantation.”  Lemutte  is an adjective,  “evil,” modifying  kaššaptu 
(“her  spell  being  that  of  an  evil  witch”),  and  not  the  predicate  of  the  clause.  Note  the 
transformations in our text achieved by the use of forms of lemēnu as additions or replace-
ments: thus kaššaptu in line 4 becomes kaššaptu lemutte here in line 27; aššu . . . ukaššipanni 
. . . ubbiranni in lines 4–5 becomes aššu īpuša lemnēti in line 18. 
 
   
Line 28: Turru (D of târu), “to turn back.” The form of both turrat and kaṣrat is a 3fs 
predicative. INIM-sa = amāssa: amātu (awātum), “word,” plus a 3fs pronominal suffix (–tš– 
becomes  –ss–).  EME =  lišānu,  “tongue.” The  n assimilates to the  š  of the 3fs pronominal 
suffix. Kaṣāru, “to tie up, to bind.” 
 
   
Line  29:  ina  UGU  =  ina  muḫḫi,  lit.,  “on  top  of”;  here  “on  account  of.”  Maḫāṣu,  “to 
strike.” The form of limḫaṣūši is a 3mp precative plus a 3fs accusative suffix. Here maḫāṣu 
connotes intimidation, humiliation, and accusation. Ilū mušīti, “the gods of the night,” are 
the subjects of the verb. 
 
   
Line  30:  3  =  šalāš.  EN.NUN.MEŠ  =  maṣṣarātu  (sg.  maṣṣartu),  “observation,  guard, 
watch.” The reading lip-šu-ra! is an emendation of lip-šu-ru; the attested forms in the MSS 
are lipšurū, lipšur, and lipašširū. In view of the divergence in the readings, the verb should 
be emended to lipšurā in agreement with the feminine plural subject (maṣṣarātu).

Line 32: Qabû, “to speak.” In view of the equations in line 31, it is clear that, contrary

in  line 33 must  be  lišānu, “tongue.”  ḪUL-tì =  lemutti, “evil, wickedness.” Itattuku (Gtn  of 
natāku), “to drip ever away.” The form of the verb is 3cs precative. 
 
   
Line 33: Lišḫarmiṭ is a Š precative 3cs from naḫarmuṭu, “to dissolve.” There is a vari-
ant that reads liḫḫarmiṭ, an N precative 3cs. Semantically, liḫḫarmiṭ seems to be the better 
reading, but it is only attested in two MSS, one Babylonian, the other from Nippur, whereas 
lišḫarmiṭ is found in four MSS, including all Nineveh texts. 
 
   
Line 34: Kiṣru, “bond, knot.” Puṭṭuru (D of paṭāru), “to release.” Ḫulluqu (D of ḫalāqu), 
“to nullify.”  Both puṭṭurū and  ḫulluqā are predicatives; the former is 3mp, the latter 3fp. 
The reading ḫulluqā is to be preferred over the variant ḫulluqū because its subject is a fem-
inine plural noun epšētūša, “her deeds.” Lines 34–35 assert that the actions (line 34) and 
the utterances (line 35, actually accusations) of the witch have been nullified. These two 
lines parallel the initial description of the witch’s deeds in lines 4–5: 34 „ 4 and 35 „ 5. 
 
   
Line 35: Kal, “all” (see kalû in line 22). Amâtu is the plural of amātu (see line 28). A 
variant in this line shows the precative limlâ rather than malâ (compare line 23). EDIN = 
ṣēru, “field.” 
 
   
Line 36: Ina qibīt, “according to the command of/that.” Qibīt in construct introduces a 
subordinate clause, which follows in the second half of the line. TU6.ÉN marks the end of 
the ritual wording (compare ÉN in line 1). This last line sounds like a standard legitimating 
formula  and  therefore  blurs  the  boundary  between  supplicatory  and  incantatory  speech 
(see page 20 in the general introduction). Note, however, the variant in line 35, which, if 
accepted, would give this last sentence a very different tone.

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

Our incantation-prayer, as many others in Maqlû and elsewhere, accompa-
nies a dynamic ritual and thus gives expression to the  changes  in state experi-
enced  by  the  patient  and  witch  throughout  the  ritual.  In  this  context  we  note 
that some psalms of individual lament seem, because of the apparent use of the 
perfect,  to  contain  not  only  the  petitioner’s  prayer,  but  also  an  expression  of 
trust that the deity has heard him (e.g., Ps 6). Some have taken this to mean that 
the psalm is part of a ritual and that the statement of confidence is the suppli-
cant’s response to the deity’s decision spoken by the priest in the form of an ora-

 

Ә AN INCANTATION-PRAYER: GODS OF THE NIGHT 1

cle  after  the  prayer  itself,  an  interpretation  to  which  I  do  not  subscribe.  But 
should this interpretation be correct, then the laments containing the statement 
of confidence should be compared to our incantation-prayer, for they too would 
have been part of a dynamic ritual.1   

As noted earlier, this incantation-prayer was recited at night to the gods of 
the night sky. For biblical texts recited as part of a night ritual, see, e.g., Hans-
Joachim Kraus, Psalms 1–59: A Continental Commentary (trans. Hilton C. Oswald; 
Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 179. 

For a description of the evil actions of one’s enemies and their unjust accu-

sations, as well as the victim’s imprecations against these enemies, see Ps 109. 

For the prohibition against witchcraft in the Hebrew Bible, see Exod 22:17.  
Pentateuchal legislations object to some practices of divination and magic large-
ly because these practices are associated with foreigners (e.g., Deut 18:9ff., Lev 
19:26,  31, and 20:6,  27). Magic and monotheism are not incompatible, and of 
course magic was practiced in ancient Israel.2 

Sigmund  Mowinckel  argued  with  some  justice  that  ן ֶו ָ  י ֵל ֲוֹפּ  of  the  Psalms 
were  malevolent  magicians  similar  to  the  Mesopotamian  witches  (see  his 
Psalmenstudien I: ʾÅwän und die individuellen Klagepsalmen (Kristiania: in Kommis-
sion bei Jacob Dybwad, 1921). 

A few points of specific interest in the Hebrew Bible: For line 14, compare 
perhaps  usages  of  בי ִר  involving  God  adjudicating  a  case  (see,  e.g.,  Pss  35:1, 
63:1). Alaktu in line 14 with the meaning “(oracular) decision” should be com-
pared with later Hebrew and Aramaic אתכלה / הכלה. For the meaning of the Ak-
kadian  and  the  relationship  with  the  Hebrew  terms,  see  Abusch,  “Alaktu  and 
Halakhah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 (1987), 15–42. For the 
cleansing motif in lines 21–24, compare Ps 51:4. With the striking in line 29, see 
Ps  3:8,  “deliver  me,  O  my  God!  For  you  slap  all  my  enemies  in  the  face;  you 
break the teeth of the wicked.” For line 32 and the melting of wax, see Mic 1:4 
and Ps 68:3.

An Incantation-Prayer: Ishtar 24 

ANNA ELISE ZERNECKE 

ISHTAR:  

Ishtar  (Sum.  Inana)  is  the  most  prominent  goddess  of  the  Mesopotamian 
 
pantheon, of prime importance in all stages of  history, and venerated in many 
(most!)  places  (e.g.,  Arbela,  Ashur,  Niniveh,  Uruk,  and  Babylon),  partly  with 
special  names.1  Different genealogical places in  the pantheon  are  attributed  to 
her: Inana / Ishtar can be described as daughter of An, the god of heaven, or of 
Sin, the moon-god (see Ishtar 2:5, 105 on pages 261 and 278 of this volume). In 
contrast  to  other female  deities,  she  is  often  not  the  wife  of  a mighty  god  but 
independent, though in Sumerian sources she can be An’s consort or, in Ashur, 
married  to  the  god  Ashur.  Her  most  prominent  husband  is  Dumuzi  (biblical 
Tammuz; Ishtar 24 was transmitted as part of a ritual for Ishtar and Dumuzi). As 
she is the epitome of a female goddess, from Old Babylonian times onwards, her 
name with the divine determinative (dištaru) is used as an appellative, meaning 
“goddess,”2 especially—with suffix—for the personal protective deity (see Ishtar 
2:39, 67, 68, 86, beginning on page 267 of this volume). She is the goddess of 
the planet Venus in both its form as evening star and morning star. Most often, 
she is characterized as goddess of love, sexuality, and war.3 This combination of 
“competences” has been explained as the result of the fusion of several deities.4 
Several  sources  emphasize  her  androgynity.5  Interestingly,  her  sexual  aspect 
does  not  make  her  a  mother-goddess—she  is  only  rarely  presented  as  mother, 
though her stay in the Netherworld results in the loss of fertility.6 She is promi-
nent in several mythical texts,  either  as a warlike goddess (e.g. Descent to the

general bipolarity.

Netherworld,  Agushaya)  or,  mostly  in  lyrical  compositions,  as  beloved  of  Du-
muzi.7 Ishtar is often associated with lions. 

In both prayers addressed to her that are part of this volume (Ishtar 2 and 
24), her astral and warlike aspects are particularly stressed. Especially in Ishtar 
2, she is the great and omnipotent goddess whose competence is universal and 
who can save from the realm of chaos and death. She is the high goddess, the 
addressee  in  case  of  problems  with  the  personal  protective  deities  (see  Ishtar 
2:85, 86  on  page  275). This  coincides with  the fact that there is only dubious 
evidence  that  she  was  anyone’s  personal  deity  herself,  though  her  minister 
Ninshubur is known in this function.8 

Both prayers, and especially their invocations, cannot be read as “dogmatic 
treatises”  of  Ishtar’s  characteristics.  Rather,  they  emphasize  those  aspects  that 
are  important  for  the  intention  of  the  text:  the  supplicant  wants  something, 
therefore they stress, on the one hand, the characteristics appealed to, and, on 
the other, traits that they experience and interpret them in a positive way. 

Ishtar is related to the levantine Astarte9 and is one of the probable candi-
dates for the identification of the “queen  of heaven” (םימשׁה תכלמ) in Jer 7:18; 
44:17–19, 25.10 In addition, the name Esther (ר ֵתּ ְס ֶא) has been discussed as possi-
bly derived from Ishtar.11 

THE PRAYER:12  

The text of the prayer is transmitted with small variants in six manuscripts. 
As  none  of  them  is  unbroken,  though  three  of  them  transmit  the prayer  in  its 
entirety, the text given here  is eclectic and usually  follows the majority of the 
manuscripts. 

The prayer is transmitted in different ritual contexts. The editions of Farber 
and  Schwemer both publish manuscripts  in  which  it forms part  of  a ritual  ad-
dressed to Ishtar and Dumuzi. The supplicant is suffering because magical rites 
have  been  performed  against  them;  figurines  of  them  have  been  buried  in  a 
grave.  The  ritual  aims  at  liberating  the  supplicant from the  netherworld while 
sending the sorcerers into it. The mythical background for the ritual is Ishtar’s 
descent into the netherworld.13 The prayer is the first spoken part of the ritual

after  the  preparations.  Nevertheless,  the  supplicant  does  not  introduce  them-
selves by name; it  is inscribed  on  the figurine of  them which is formed  before 
the recitation of the prayer. 

The prayer begins with an invocation (lines 1–8) in which Ishtar’s greatness 
is praised, especially the effect of her command (ina qibītīki Ištar, lines 4 and 7) 
on  the  suffering.  In  the  following  lines  (9–14),  the  supplicant  presents  them-
selves as suffering and appealing to Ishtar, asking her to decide their case and 
hoping to witness her aspects just praised. In lines 15–22, the machinations of 
sorcerers are identified as the root of the supplicant’s sufferings, ending with the 
proclamation of the decision to act magically against them (line 22). The prayer 
ends  (23–27)  with  the  supplicant’s  entrusting  themselves  to  Ishtar’s might  and 
pleas.

   LÚ.GIG i-bal-lu-uṭ a-mi-ru IGI-ki 
 

šiptu: elletum Ištar šaqūtu ilī Igigî 

 
Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, the superscription of the prayer, which is not part of the text to be 
  
recited. Šiptu is usually translated as “incantation” (CAD Š/3, 86); but it should be under-
stood as a technical term for the beginning of the text to be recited in a ritual; thus, “ritual 
wording”  or  the  like.  KÙ  =  ellu,  “pure,  clean,  holy.”  Šaqû  (m),  šaqūtu,  šaqītu  (f),  “high, 
elevated”; as the adjective is the regens of a construct chain, the –u at the end is not ex-
pected. DINGIR.MEŠ = ilū “gods.” Igigû, the gods of heaven, see Ishtar 2, notes to line 3. In 
MS HH, the line is longer: šaqūt ilī šaruḫti Igigî, “most high among the gods, splendid one of 
the Igigi!” (Šarḫu, “proud, splendid.”) In all preserved texts, the name Ishtar (lines 1, 4, 7, 
8, 15) is written differently, the single MSS are not consistent: dINANA, d15, and dIŠ8.DAR. 
 
   
Line 2: Epēšu, “to do, to make.” This verb is used four times in this prayer (lines 2, 14 
twice, and 22). In all other contexts, its special connotation is important: besides the neu-
tral sense “to do,” it can also mean “to perform” (a ritual, magic, especially hostile magic, 
‘Schadenzauber’; see Schwemer, Rituale, 1, n.2.). Anuntu, “fight, combat.” Šakānu, “to put, 
to place, to arrange.” Tuquntu (tuqumtu), “battle.” Note Ishtar 2:6 (page 261): the second 
part of the line is identical. 
 
 
Line 3: Gitmālu (m), gitmāltu (f), “perfect, ideal.” d15 is not only a way of writing the 
  
name  of  the  goddess  Ishtar,  but  also  the  noun  ištaru,  “goddess.”  As  gitmāltu  ištarāti  is  a 
construct chain, the case vowel ending gitmāltu is not expected. 
 

ēpišat anunti šākinat tuqunti 

šaruḫtu gitmāltu ištarāti 

 
Line 4: Qibītu, “command, order.” The suffix is written –ka (2ms) here rather than the 
  
expected –ki (2fs), but it certainly refers to Ishtar. Ina qibītīka / qibītīki at the head of this 
line connects the line to lines 7 and 23. Ušteššerē is 3fp durative from šutēšuru (Št pass. of 
ešēru), “to be put in order, to be guided aright.” Tenēštu, “people, personnel,” pl. tenēšētu, 
“humankind.” The ending is grammatically nominative. In lines 4–11 the reading in MS HH 
is  partly  different.  These  differences  are  normalized  and  translated  at  the  end  of  every 
note. Variant HH: ina qabêki Ištar iššerā te[nēšētu], “at your speaking, Ishtar, humankind is 
well.” 
 
 
Line 5: LÚ.GIG = marṣu, “sick person.” Balāṭu, “to live, to be healed.” Amāru, “to see, 
  
to look at.” The participle, which modifies marṣu, is bound to the following substantive (IGI 
= pānū, “face”). An “overhanging” u on a participle in construct is not uncommon in SB

Akkadian (see Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der jungbabylonischen 
„hymnischen“  Literatur,  2  Vols.  [Freiburger  Altorientalische  Studien  14/1–2;  Stuttgart: 
Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 2.41 for examples). Besides Ishtar’s verbal action (lines 4, 7), 
the invocation is structured by the effects of seeing her face on the suffering (lines 5, 8). 
See Ishtar 2:40–41 (see page 267). Variant HH: mītu iballuṭ, “the dead one lives.” 
 

marṣu iballuṭ āmiru pānīki 

ippaṭṭar eʾiltašu itebbi arḫiš 

 
Line 6: Napṭuru (N of paṭāru), “to be loosened, to be untied.” The form is a 3cs dura-
  
tive. Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, liability, sin.” Tebû, “to rise up, to get up.” Arḫiš, “quickly, hasti-
ly.” Variant HH: kasû ippaṭṭar, “the one who is bound is untied.” 
 
 
Line 7: See line 4. We expect ina qibītīki rather than ina qibītki. Perhaps the BIT sign is 
  
to be read biti. Nāṭilu, “seeing”; lā nāṭilu, “blind.” IGI.LÁ = amāru, “to see, to look at.” dZÁ-
LAG = nūru, “light.” Variant HH: lā nāṭi[lu, “the blin[d one . . . ].” 
 
 
Line 8: See line 5. Ešēru, “to be well, to thrive, to prosper.” Išaru, “straight, right, in 
  
order”;  lā  išaru,  “not  right.”  The  participle  āmiru  modifies  lā  išaru.  See  Ishtar  2:41.  HH: 
iššer Ištar lā išaru ina [ . . . ], “the unfortunate becomes all right, Ishtar, in. . . .” 
 

ina qibītīki Ištar lā nāṭilu immar nūra 

iššer Ištar lā išaru āmiru pānīki 

Line 9: Anāku, “I.” Šumruṣu, “suffering” (adj.). The use of šumruṣu refers back to the 
 
praise of Ishtar’s effect on the marṣu (line 5; marṣu and šumruṣu come from the same root). 
IGI  =  maḫru,  “front”;  (ina)  maḫar,  “before,  in  the  presence  of  (someone).”  Kamāsu,  “to 
kneel, to squat down.” Izuzzu, “to stand, to serve, to be present.” Kamāsu and izuzzu are 
both  preterites  which  can  be  interpreted  as  performative  (Koinzidenzfall);  see  Mayer, 
UFBG, 181–209. Variant HH: anāku šumruṣāku maḫarki [ . . . ], “I am suffering, in front of 
you [ . . . ].” 
 
   
Line 10: Dipāru, “torch.” The fem. form only occurs here. Dânu (diānum), “to judge,” 
often  with  dīnu  (“legal  decision,  lawsuit”)  as  object  (figura  etymologica).  The  verb  is  an 
infinitive with a locative-adverbial suffix (see Farber, 253; GAG §66f) in two MSS (aa, gg); 
the other two MSS (b, HH) read dânu. Saḫāru, “to go around, to turn (to), to search.” Again, 
the preterite is performative.

Line 11:  IGI =pānū, see line 5. Pānīki ātamar refers back to lines 5 and 8 which de-
  
scribe the effect of looking at Ishtar’s face for the suffering one; the plea lippaṭir kasītī al-
ludes to ippaṭṭar eʾiltašu in line 6. Kasītu, “(magical) constraint”; see line 6 in MS HH, which 
mentions the  kasû, “bound, captive.” Variant HH: usḫī  murṣī  lippaṭ[ir. .  . ], “tear out my 
illness, may it be loosened [ . . .].” 
 
 
Line  12:  It  is  a  bit  of  a  problem  to  determine  from  which  verb  tumarrê  is  derived. 
  
Farber, 253, analyzes it tentatively as a G or D stem 2fs durative from marû, “to do slow-
ly”; see Seux, 458, n.6. Ešû, “confused.” Dalḫu, “troubled, disturbed.”

Line 17: Riksu, “binding, knot, bond; assemblage (of offerings).” Kišpu, “sorcery, evil 
  
spell.” ḪUL.GIG = zīru, “hate.” ZI.KU5.RU.DA = zikurudû, “cutting of life.” Two MSS begin the 
line with ša instead of ina. Rikis kišpi zīri u zikurudê is one construct chain.

Line 23: DU11.GA = qibītu. Ṣīru, “exalted.” NU = lā. KÚR = nakāru, “to be(come) dif-
ferent, to change.” The form behind the logogram may be a G inf., for parallels to which, 
see CAD N/1, 165, or a Dt durative, uttakkaru. Lines 23–24 form a frequent stock phrase, 
used in pleas and at the end of prayers; see Mayer, UFBG, 303–4. 
 
  
Line 24: Annu, “(word of) consent, approval.” Kīnu, “permanent, true, reliable.”  BAL

durative, innennû.

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

The supplicant in Ishtar 24 is not mentioned alone, but is involved in differ-
 
ent relations. As it is usual also in biblical psalms of individual lament, there is 
an “I” (the supplicant), a “you” (the deity), and a “them” (a group of “others”). 
The  complaints  can  be  directed  in  these  three  directions:  they  can  be  “I-
complaints”  (see  lines  12b,  13),  “god-complaints”  (not  in  Ishtar  24),  or  com-
plaints against the hostile group, here the sorcerer or sorceress (lines 15–20).1 In 
the Psalms, the hostile group consists usually of enemies, whose affronting acts 
are the objects of complaints (see, e.g., Ps 13:5. 38:20–21) and whose threaten-
ing character can be compared to wild and deadly animals (see Ps 22:13–14, 17, 
and 22). The general similarity has led to the interpretation that the enemies in 
the  Psalms  are  not  only  a  structural parallel  to the Mesopotamian  sorcerers  in 
the three dimensions of relations in prayers, but that their evil actions are to be 
interpreted as magical.2 The prayer Ishtar 24 indicates that this interpretation is 
at least not obvious. The eight lines dealing with the sorcerers (lines 15–22) and 
already some passages in the earlier complaints show the well-developed Meso-
potamian  terminology  for  witchcraft:  besides  the  generic  term  kišpu  (“witch-

craft”, line 17) and the related nouns kaššāpu and kaššaptu (“wizard / sorcerer” 
and “witch / sorceress”, line 15), there are special terms for malevolent magical 
practices: zikurudû (“cutting of life,” line 17), nakās napišti (“cutting the throat / 
life,” line 20) and even the description of magical acts (the laying of figures of a 
person in a grave as in line 19). There is also epēšu, a verb with special connota-
tions  in  magical  contexts  (lines  2,  14,  and  22),  which  the  supplicant  uses  for 
their actions against the sorcerers (line 22).3 The descriptions of the enemies in 
the Psalms show no such specialized terminology but are much more ambiguous, 
though the enemies still seem to be surrounded by a “demonic atmosphere.”4 
 
3  See the note on line 2. For the terminology, see Schwemer, Rituale, 1, n.2. The ritual in which 
Ishtar 24 is embedded in at least three of the MSS aims at doing what the supplicant mentions in 
line  22:  the  figure  representing  them  is  saved  from  the  netherworld  and  cleaned,  the  figures 
representing  the  sorcerer  and  sorceress  are  sent  into  the  netherworld  as  their  substitute;  see 
Schwemer, Abwehrzauber, 215–17.

An Incantation-Prayer: Nusku 12 

DUANE SMITH 

NUSKU: 

Nusku was the god of fire and lamp/torch light. Iconographically, he is rep-
resented by  a  lamp.  In  some texts,  he  is  the  son  of  Enlil,  in  others  of  Anu.  At 
Harran in northern Syria, where  he seems to have had a cult center, he is the 
son of Sin.1 As Parpola suggests,2 Nusku may have been worshiped as the god of 
the crescent moon at some locations. At least at Harran, and perhaps elsewhere, 
Nusku is associated with the moon. He has an important relationship with Sha-
mash.3 As the present prayer indicates, he is the tappê Šamaš, “the companion of 
Shamash.” While never among the most prominent Mesopotamian gods, Nusku 
was venerated for a very long time, with evidence of his worship extending from 
the  Old  Akkadian  (2350–2120  BCE)  to  the  Hellenistic  periods  (330–30  BCE).4 
There  were  two  temples  dedicated  to  him  at  Nippur.  There  were  also  shrines 
dedicated to him at Babylon in the Marduk temple complex and at Dur Untash 
(modern  Chogha  Zanbil)  in  Elam.  Many  of  Nusku’s  roles  and  traits  are  nearly 
identical to those of Girra, also a god of fire (see page 145). Three of his roles 
are particularly important in understanding the present prayer: a guardian of the 
night,  a  courier  of  dreams,  and,  like  Shamash,  an  anti-magician.5  When  called 
upon,  Nusku  could  reverse  ominous  portents  or  magical  spells.  The  following 
lines from Maqlû exemplify this role.6

THE PRAYER:  

This  prayer  to  Nusku  is  part  of  an  apotropaic  ritual  whose  purpose  is  to 
provide relief from a dream with a possible bad portent.7 The text introduces the 
prayer  with  a  simple  indication  of  direct  speech,  umma  šū-ma—in  fact,  this  is 
part  of  the  ritual  instructions.  Unlike  the  common  tri-partite  structure of most 
prayers, this prayer has two parts: an extremely short invocation and a compli-
cated petition, as the following indicates.  

A) Name, relationship, and function  

1) Potential bad portents from a dream 
2) Time of dream 
3) Nature of knowledge of dream

3) Final request 

The  prayer  begins  with  an  invocation  that  calls  upon  Nusku  as  judge  and 
companion of Shamash, the consummate judge, and asks that Nusku judge the 
supplicant’s case. The petition begins by recounting a dream. The supplicant is 
concerned about the portent of a dream that he had had the previous night. He 
uses  only  an  indefinite  time  formula,  ina  bararti  qablīti  šāt urri,  to  identify  the 
dream.  The  supplicant  acknowledges  that  Nusku  will  certainly  understand  the 
dream’s portent even if he does not. But there is a further concern. Not knowing 
the portent of the dream, the supplicant does not know if it is for good or evil.  
He asks Nusku to remove any evil portent while preserving benefits of any good 
portent.  But  the  major  concern  remains  any potential  negative  consequence of 
the dream. At this point, the supplicant asks that he be permanently dissociated 
from  the  dream  even  to  the  point  of  asking  that  it  not  be  his.  The  supplicant 
then references the just completed ritual using its symbolic acts as analogies for 
his requested dissociation from any evil portent of the dream. This rather convo-
luted sentence ties back to the opening of the petition by restating the time for-
mula.  Finally, the prayer has the supplicant summarize the petition, “may it not 
be mine.”  

Although only fragmentary portions of the accompanying ritual are now ex-
tant, Butler was able to glean several important elements from these. In the por-
tion of the ritual just before the prayer, the supplicant’s hem is cut off and held 
along  with  a  reed(?)  before  a  lamp,  the  symbol  of  Nusku.  After  the  prayer  is 
spoken, it appears that the reed is snapped and wrapped(?) in the hem. Another 
brief prayer follows. The ground is touched and the lamp lit. Finally, the suppli-
cant prays (again?) to his personal deities and to the lamp.8  

Oppenheim  suggested  the  supplicant  had  forgotten  the  worrisome  dream 
but Butler argues, I think correctly, that it was the nature of the dream’s portent 
that was unknown to the supplicant.9 The portent may be good; but then again it 
may  be  awful.  The  supplicant  therefore  seeks  relief from any  negative  portent 
without forfeiting any possible good that may come of it.  

Even  though  he  could  find  no  physical  join,  Oppenheim10  suggested  as  a 
“working  hypothesis”  that  the most  complete  witness  to  this  prayer,  MS  A,  be-
longed  to  Tablet  I  of  the  series  Zīqīqu,  the  Assyrian  Dream  Book.  He  based  his 
suggestion  on  orthography  and  the  double line  column  separator.  Be this  as  it 
may,  there  can  be  no  doubt  that  our  prayer  is  part  of  the  same  oneiromantic 
tradition as Zīqīqu.

of  the  ritual  portions  of  the tablets,  most  of  it  is  unreadable.  I  therefore  have  not  included  it  
below.

Line 1: Umma šū-ma is not part of the prayer proper. Umma indicates the beginning of 
direct discourse. Šū-ma refers to the person offering the prayer. The –ma tightly ties umma 
šū to what follows. dPA.KU (dPA-TÚG) = the god Nusku. dUTU = the god Shamash (see page 
197). Tappû, here in the acc., has a range of meanings from “business partner” to “neigh-
bor” to “companion” (see CAD T, 184–90). Syntactically, attā, “you,” belongs to the next 
line. 

umma šū-ma Nusku tappê Šamaš

Line 2: This line begins with three forms of dânu (diānum), “to judge,” that are part of 
two separate but related clauses: dayyānāta, 2ms predicative; dīnu, “case, verdict, punish-
ment” or the like, with 1cs suffix; and dīn, G impv. This same three-word stock expression 
occurs elsewhere with reference to other gods (see CAD D, 101). Of particular significance 
is KAR 252 iii 4, which reads, Šamaš dayyānāta dīnī dīn, “Shamas, you are the judge. Judge 
my case!” Nearly identical language is used of Girra in Maqlû II 69–90. See Oppenheim, 
300, for a translation and discussion. See also Maqlû I 76, Nusku  dayyānu, “Nusku is the 
judge.” Such language is common with reference to Shamash and Adad but not so common 
with Nusku. The two clauses and their use of the same root provide a transition from the 
brief invocation to the petition. Nusku is a judge. Now it is time for him to judge the sup-
plicant’s  case.  MÁŠ.GE6  =  šuttu,  “dream,”  is  accompanied  by  the  demonstrative  pronoun 
annītu, “this.”

Line 3: The ša introduces a relative clause, whose verb is ibbablam-ma in line 4. The 
clause  further  defines  the  dream.  Barartu  (barārītu),  “evening  watch.”  Qablīti,  “middle 
(watch).” Šāt urri, “morning watch.” The line means little more than “some unknown time 
during the night or early morning.” 

ša ina bararti qablīti šāt urri 

Line 4: Nabbulu (N of babālu, related to [w]abālu), “to be carried, to be brought.” The 
ventive suffix on the verb prevents it from showing the subjunctive, which is expected in a 
subordinate (relative) clause (see ša in line 3). The –ma is conjunctive. Because of the par-
allel with the first person form of idû, “to know,” in the second half of the line, there can 
be little doubt that Ì.ZU = tīdû, “you know,” in the first half. IGI.ZU is a far more common 
writing for this root. Ša attā tīdû anāku lā īdû is a version of a stock formula found in many 
prayers. Butler argues  that  we  would expect kullu  (DIB) rather  than  idû if the supplicant 
simply didn’t  remember the  dream (92). Although our text has the  Sumerogram  Ì.ZU for 
tīdû, Ì.ZU can also stand, on occasion, for asû, “physician,” or even bārû, “diviner.” See CAD 
A, 344 and B, 121 for examples. In light of this, one might consider the possibility of what 
Scott Noegel calls a “visual (purely based on orthography)” as opposed to an “oral (based 
only on sound)” pun between Ì.ZU and īdû (see his Nocturnal Ciphers: The Allusive Language 
of Dreams in the Ancient Near East [New Haven: American Oriental Society, 2007], 1, n.2). 
If such a pun were involved,  the orthography, but not the  pronunciation, would  further 
contrast  Nusku’s  knowledge  (Ì.ZU)  with  the  supplicant’s  lack  of  knowledge  (lā  īdû)  and 
simultaneously imply extending Nusku’s range of knowledge to include healing and divi-
nation. 

ibbablam-ma ša attā tīdû anāku lā īdû 
 Line  5:  damqat is from  damāqu, “to be(come) good.” In dreams and omens,  dumqu, 
(dumuq  is  the  bound  form)  means  “favorable  interpretation”;  see  CAD  D,  180–81.  The 
writing  a-a = ayy-, “may it not,” is the vetitive prefix, which indicates a negative wish. 
Šêṭu here, as in other prayers and curses, means “to leave, to bypass, to escape (me)” (see 
CAD Š/2, 344). 

šumma damqat dumuqša ayy-išīṭanni 
 Line 6:  ḪUL = lemnet, a 3fs predicative from lemēnu, “to be(come) bad,” parallel to 
damqat in line 7.  ḪUL-šá = lumun-ša  = lumušša, “its evil.” Kašādu, “to reach, to arrive.” 
Kašādu  is  often  associated  with  the  arrival  of  diseases  and  other  misfortunes,  including 
death; see CAD K, 278.

 Line 7:  Yattun, “mine,” is a  fs form of  yā’u (see also line 11). Alan Lenzi discusses 
lines 6–12—specifically the phrase lā yattun šī here and in line 12—in the context of the 
stock expression šiptu ul ya/uttun, “the incantation is not mine.” Notice that in our text the 
stock phrase has been turned into a wish, a subjunctive as indicated by lā rather than its 
more common indicative mood with  ul  (“Siptu  ul  Yuttun: Some Reflections  On  A Closing 
Formula In Akkadian Incantations,” in Gazing on the Deep: Ancient Near Eastern and Other 
Studies in Honor of Tzvi Abusch [ed. Jeffrey Stackert, Barbara Nevling Porter, and David P. 
Wright; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2010], 131–66, here 161). The word kīma, “as, like,” intro-
duces the first ritual analogy of the prayer. GI = qanû, “reed.” Naṭpu, “torn out,” is a ver-
bal adjective from naṭāpu, “to tear out, to uproot” (see CAD N/2, 128) with a subjunctive 
(–u) suffix. Kīma marks the beginning of a very long, complex sentence with several subor-
dinate clauses (and even a subordinate clause within a clause). The subject of the sentence 
is in line 9b (lumun šutti) and its verb is in line 11 (ayy-ikšudanni). 

lā yattun šī kīma qanû annû naṭpū-ma 
 Line 8: MS A reads ana KI-šú but MS B reads ana ni-iṭ-pi-šú, “to its place of plucking.” KI 
= ašru, “place.” Ana ašrīšu generally means “(to be restored) to its place.”  NU = lā. GUR 
(MS A’s reading) = iturru, a G preterite with subjunctive –u, from târu, “to turn, to return.” 
MS B confirms this reading with i-tu-[ru . . . ]. The first partially readable line of the ritual 
preceding the prayer mentions qan kiṣri, “a reed joint” (see Butler, 314, line 1). Unfortu-
nately, the associated verb is unclear. The kīma in this line begins a second ritual analogy. 
TÚG.SÍG = sissiktu, “hem, fringe, edge.” See CAD S, 322–25 for the most common defini-
tions  of  sissiktu.  Meir  Mallul  suggested  that  a  sissiktu  is  “some  type  of  loincloth  or  lap-
garment” (“‘Sissiktu’ and ‘sikku’ Cutting Off a sissiktu - Their Meaning and Function,” BiOr 
43.1/2 [1986], 20–36, here 36). See the further discussion of sissiktu in the note on line 15 
of Shamash 25, page 426. The impression of a sissiktu could serve in lieu of a seal (CAD S, 
322–25). TÚG = ṣubātu, “garment.” Batāqu, “to cut off.” MS B preserves the expected sub-
junctive on the 3fs predicative verb (batqatu). This second ritual analogy may reflect the 
cutting (batāqu) of a sissiktu as a symbolic act of divorce just as tying (rakāsu) a sissiktu was 
a symbolic act of marriage (see CAD S, 322). The supplicant seeks to symbolically divorce 
himself from any negative portent of his dream. 

ana ašrīšu (var. niṭpīšu) lā iturru kīma sissiktu annītu ina ṣubātīya batqat(u)-ma 
 Line  9:  MS  A inserts the  word  ḫepî, “broken,” between  TÚG and  GIM,  indicating that 
there were unreadable signs in this place in the text (somewhere in the ancestry of MS A) 
due to a broken or defaced tablet. Ḫepî is the common scribal method of indicating such a 
break. MS B, however, reads TÚG-ia at this location. GIM = kīma, here means “because” or 
the like and introduces a subordinate clause within the larger subordinate clause. Ibbatqu, 
“it was torn,” is an N preterite of batāqu (with subjunctive). MS B varies, reading a G pret-
erite (with subjunctive): ibtuqu, “he tore (it).” The image of the torn hem reflects the ritual 
requirement to “cut off (batāqu) the hem of the right side of his (garment)” in the ritual

instructions immediately before the prayer (Butler, 314; Oppenheim, 289, 340). The last 
few words of the line form the subject of the independent clause, upon which the preced-
ing lines (7b–9a) depend. 

ana ṣubātīya kīma ibbatqū-ma lā iturru lumun šutti annīti 

Line 10: Assuming that the end of this line is correctly restored, line 10 is identical to 
line 3 plus the first word in line 4. As there, these words form a relative clause that further 
defines  the  dream.  This  restatement  together  with  the  final  plea  provides  a  summary 
statement of the long plea that precedes it. As such, it produces an emphasized sense of 
urgency.  

ša ina bararti qablīti šāt urri ibbablam-ma 
Line 11: Ayy-ikšudanni is the main verb of the long sentence that started in line 7b. MS 
A lacks this verb and instead understands the final clause of the line to be the main sen-
tence. According to MS A, everything preceding lā yattun šī all the way back to the kīma in 
line 7b must be read as an anacoluthon. This final clause is identical to the first clause in 
line 7, thereby framing (in  MS B) the ritual analogies and final petition. Here the prayer 
proper apparently ends. The rest of the ritual is rather broken (see the introduction to the 
prayer above).

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS: 

In 1873, Sayce tentatively suggested that biblical Nisroch (ךרסנ, 2 Kgs 19:37 
„ Isa 37:38) might be none other than the god Nusku. Since then, this view has 
come  in  and  out  of  currency  but  has  never  gained  permanent  traction.  At  the 
very  best,  the  evidence  is  weak  and  dependent  on  unsupportable  assumptions 
about a number of modifications and/or errors in the way Hebrew scribes wrote 
and preserved the name. These unsupportable assumptions render the suggestion 
unlikely if not impossible. Uehlinger outlines the several problems with the sug-
gestion.1  

Nusku as the lamp that lights the darkness is not mentioned in this Akkadi-
an prayer, though the ritual implies this role for the deity. The prayer-hymn of 
David in 2 Sam 22, especially 
, “You, O Yahweh, are 
my lamp;  Yahweh lights my darkness” (v 29), attributes a similar role to Yah-
weh.

One of the obvious elements of this Akkadian prayer is that the supplicant 
does not know the meaning of his dream. In contrast is the story of  Joseph in

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Gen 37  where both Joseph  and his brothers know the meanings of his dreams 
and know them without the aid of professional oneiromancy. One sees the same 
with Daniel’s dreams. In general, biblical actors understand their dreams with-
out professional assistance. Among the very few exceptions are foreigners, Phar-
aoh and Nebuchadnezzar, for example.2 This Nusku prayer and its ritual do not 
appear  to  comprehend  the  possibility  that  a  dream  might  be  meaningless—a 
possibility suggested by Job 20:8 and Isa 29:7–8.3 

Discussed more fully in connection with one of the prayers to Shamash,4 the 
role of the gods, particularly Shamash and Adad and less frequently Nusku, as 
judges is important in several prayers. Compare the role of Yahweh as judge in 
Gen 18:25, Job 21:22, Pss 7:9, 43:1, 50:6, 82:1, 3, 8, and elsewhere. The Akka-
dian stock phrase dīnī dīn, “judge my case,” in line 2, finds an extremely close 
semantic equivalent in 

, “judge my case,” in Lam 3:59b.

Cutting off the hem of a garment as a metaphor for an act that cannot be 
undone  is  reminiscent  of  David’s  cutting  off  of  Saul’s 
,  “corner  of  the 
cloak,” in 1 Sam 24:5, an act of humiliation. By tearing off the hem of his own 
garment,  our  supplement  humbles  himself  while  at  the  same  time  provides  a 
symbol  of  the  desire  for  a  permanent  “divorce,”  or  separation,  from  any  evil 
portent of his dream. Compare also 1 Sam 15:27, where Saul tears off Samuel’s

The  Biblical  tradition  does  not  share  the  concern  expressed  in  the  Nusku 
prayer that a dream’s significance could be ambiguous.5 The closest parallel to 
this  prayer  within  the  extended  Jewish  tradition  comes  from  the  Babylonian 
Talmud rather than the Hebrew Bible. Ber 55b6 records a prayer containing simi-
lar themes to some of those found in our Nusku prayer.

5  In  fact,  biblical  authors  show  a  strong  tendency  to  distrust  diviners.  In  places  there  is  great 
concern that diviners might be the source of false prophecy. See Deut 13:2–6, where we see the 
concern  that,  even  if  the  portent  comes  true,  such  diviners  may  lead  to  the  worship  of  other 
gods. Deut 18:21–22 claims that an oracle that does not come true is a sure indication that it is 
not from Yahweh.

discusses this prayer/ritual as evidence for an “incomplete transition” from a revelation to inter-
pretation based religion (see “Madness and Prophecy: Dreams, Texts, and the Power of Rabbinic 
Interpretation,” Pastoral Psychology 56:2 [Nov, 2007], 223–35).

good dreams, confirm them and reinforce them like the dreams of Joseph, and if 
they require a remedy, heal them, as the waters of Marah were healed by Moses, 
our teacher, and as Miriam was healed of her leprosy and Hezekiah of his sick-
ness,  and  the  waters  of  Jericho  by  Elisha.  As  thou  didst  turn  the  curse  of  the 
wicked Balaam into a blessing, so turn all my dreams into something good for 
me. [References omitted]  

The prayer is attributed to Amemar II (c. 400 CE), Mar Zutra, or R. Ashi (most 
likely  Amemar).  This  prayer  answered  a  challenge  to  tell  something  the  other 
members of the group might not know. Note the uncertainty as to the portent of 
the reported dream in both the Talmudic prayer and our Nusku prayer. Both also 
desire that the portent of their dreams be upheld if good but avoided if bad.

An Incantation-Prayer to the Cultic Agent Salt 

JEFFREY STACKERT 

SALT:  

There is little evidence from ancient Mesopotamia for the deification of salt. 
The ruler of the Middle Euphrates kingdom of Mari, Zimri-Lim, did erect a statue 
to Ḫatta, the god of salt,1 but it does not seem that such veneration of a salt god 
was widespread or persistent. Salt was employed widely in the ancient Near East 
for  various  utilitarian  purposes  (e.g.,  curing  hides,  preservation,  flavor  en-
hancement, and medicine). It was also a regular ingredient in ritual and magical 
practices.2 For example, by analogy to its use at the human table, Mesopotamian 
texts describe the application of salt to animal and vegetable offerings. It is also 
employed in incense offerings, various magical rites, and ritual curses. The anal-
ogies  of  Mesopotamian  omen  literature  likewise  reference  salt.  Among  Hittite 
rituals, perhaps the best known use of salt is one that parallels its use in Mesopo-
tamian curses: the First Hittite Soldier’s Oath employs salt within an analogical 
curse ritual against that soldier who would commit sedition.3  

The ancient Near Eastern ritual applications for salt indicate that it carries 
both  positive  and  negative  significances.  It  can  symbolize  health,  purification, 
and  well-being,  but  it  can  also  be  associated  with  infertility,  dissolution,  and 
destruction. Salt is also employed ritually across the gamut of social ranks. 
 
1  See CAD Ṭ, 11b, citing M.10591: 9 (discussed briefly by Francis Joannes in NABU 1989, #75). 
2  It  is  oftentimes  difficult  to  draw  a  meaningful  distinction  between  medicine  and  magic.  For 
discussions of these categories and their relationship, see, e.g., Jean Bottéro, “Magic and Medi-
cine,” in Everyday Life in Ancient Mesopotamia (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 
162–82;  Walter  Farber,  “Witchcraft,  Magic,  and  Divination  in  Ancient  Mesopotamia,”  CANE 
3:1895–1909;  Robert  Biggs,  “Medicine,  Surgery,  and  Public  Health  in  Ancient  Mesopotamia,” 
CANE 3:1911–24. See also JoAnn Scurlock’s discussion of medicaments (Magico-Medical Means of 
Treating Ghost-Induced Illnesses in Ancient Mesopotamia [Ancient Magic and Divination 3; Leiden: 
Brill/Styx,  2006],  67–71),  as  well  as  her  texts  nos.  60  and  191a  for  examples  of  the  magico-
medical usage of salt in Mesopotamia.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

THE PRAYER:  

The salt incantation-prayer appears in Tablet VI (lines 111–119) of the eight 
tablet  series  known  as  Maqlû  (“burning”).  The  canonical  form  of  Maqlû  dates 
from  the  first  millennium  BCE  and  constitutes  a  complex  ritual  ceremony  for 
counteracting  sorcery  and  effecting  retribution  against  the  witch(es)  or  war-
lock(s) who has (have) unjustly afflicted an innocent target. The salt incantation-
prayer  is  one  of  several  incantations  to  be  recited  by  a  victim  of  black  magic 
and, according to the ritual tablet that accompanies the series, is to be attended 
by a fumigation rite.4 The prayer is characterized by a tripartite structure: hym-
nic introduction, petition, and promise of praise in response to divine assistance. 
The first four lines comprise the hymnic introduction with stereotypical acclaim 
of the addressee. Lines 5–8a comprise the entreaty to remove the witchcraft that 
afflicts  the  speaker.  Lines  8b–9  contain  the  concluding  promise  to  praise  salt 
upon its successful intervention on the petitioner’s behalf.  

Because it does not address a deity, the salt incantation-prayer is not a con-
ventional  example  of  the  shuilla.  It  instead  belongs  to  a  relatively  small  sub-
category  of  texts  termed  Kultmittelbeschwörungen  or  Kultmittelgebete  (“incanta-
tions/prayers to a cultic agent”).5 Much like shuillas directed to particular dei-
ties, incantation-prayers to cultic agents attempt to exploit specific characteris-
tics of their addressees to remedy the patient’s predicament. 

The speaker’s predicament in the salt incantation-prayer appears to be two-
fold. What  is obvious is that the supplicant  suffers the ill effects of  witchcraft. 
Yet several factors suggest that the situation in this case is more complex. First, 
this text’s promise of praise contains two significant features that point to a rich-
er  religious  conceptualization  of  the  speaker’s  predicament:  (1)  The  speaker 
draws  an  analogy  between  their  action  and  the  action  taken  toward  “the  god 
who made me,” i.e., the personal god; and (2) The promise to praise employs the 
iterative stem of the verb (lultammarki), a unique usage among the shuilla-type 
incantation-prayers that address non-deified objects. Second, the progression of 
ritual applications for salt envisioned in this incantation-prayer (flavor enhancer 
for food offerings, incense additive, and finally fumigation additive) may reflect 
a progression of ritual activities performed by the speaker to counteract misfor-
tune. This precise sequence is attested in Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 1–22.6 This passage 
in  Ludlul  explicitly  describes  divine  abandonment  and  its  effects,  a  recurrent 
 
4  The ritual (Ritual Tablet [IX] 118–120) reads: šiptu attī ṭābtu ša ina ašri elli ibbanû / ana muḫḫi 
kīrban ṭābti tamannū-ma / ina muḫḫi nignakki ša qutāri ša ina rēš mayyāli tašakkan, “The incanta-
tion ‘You are salt, the one made in a pure place’ you shall recite over a lump of salt and you shall 
place  (it)  (i.e.,  the  salt) in the fumigant  burner that  is  at  the  head  of the  bed  (i.e.,  of the  pa-
tient).” See Meier’s edition (61).

introduction.

Project, 2010), 6, 19.

topic in Maqlû (e.g., I 1–14).7 Taken together, these factors suggest that the salt 
incantation-prayer provides a remedy not only for the witchcraft that afflicts the 
supplicant but also the abandonment of the personal god, a departure effected 
by the afflicting spell.8

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This term marks the beginning  of 
the prayer but is not part of its text. It is characteristic of ritual texts more broadly and is 
thus not limited to prayers per se. Attī, “you” (fs). MUN = ṭābtu, “salt.” Ašru, “place.” KÙ = 
ellu, “pure, clean.” Nabnû (N of banû), “to be built, to be made.” The form is a 3cs preterite 
with subordination marker. Ša  ina  ašri elli  ibbanû: this terminology parallels that used to 
describe  the  production  of  divine  images  in  Mesopotamia  (see  Christopher  Walker  and

Line 2: mākālû, “food, meal,” oftentimes used to characterize food offerings to deities. 
DINGIR.MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” GAL.MEŠ = rabûtu, “great.” The “great gods” can refer to the gods 
in general or to the chief deities of the pantheon. In light of the parallelism with Ellil (= 
dEN.LÍL), the lauditory tone of the invocation, and especially the banquet described in the 
following line,  the great  gods here are likely the  principle deities.  Šâmu  (šiāmu),  “to  ap-
point”.  The  2fs  accusative  suffix  on  the  verb  refers  to  ṭābtu,  “salt”  in  line  1.  Among  its 
various usages, the verb šâmu may denote the assignment of roles and offices to deities, 
including by Ellil (see CAD Š/I, 358–59). Ellil, “lord [of the] wind,” is the high god who 
resides in the temple é-kur, “mountain house” (see line 3), in Nippur. 

ana mākālê ilī rabûti išīmki Ellil 

   
Line 3: Ina balī-X, “without X.” Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be set, to be established.” 
Iššakkan is an N 3cs durative. Naptanu, “meal, (royal/cultic) banquet.” Naptan may be read 
as the absolute form of the noun. Yet there seems to be little significance to the absence of 
the case ending here. Maqlû II 9–10, which is a near verbatim parallel to lines 3–4 here, 
attests two variants: naptanu and naptana. These examples suggest the possibility of read-
ing the TAN sign here as a CVCV sign (i.e., tana) rather than a CVC sign. Alternatively, the 
case ending could simply be implied. It must also be noted that, as a first millennium As-
syrian text, such omission of the case vowel is hardly anomalous. 

ina balīki ul iššakkan naptan ina E-kur 

   
Line 4: LUGAL = šarru, “king.” IDIM = kabtu, “noble, influential person.” NUN = rubû, 
“prince, nobleman.” The quartet of god, king, noble, and prince recurs in Mesopotamian 
prayers and incantations as a formulaic expression to denote those to whom the speaker is 
subordinate.  Eṣēnu,  “to  smell.”  Qutrinnu,  “incense.”  Incense  offerings  oftentimes  appear 
alongside food offerings. The claim of this line is also applied elsewhere to deities, again 
underscoring the conceit of addressing the non-deity salt in a shuilla-type prayer. 

ina balīki ilu šarru kabtu u rubû ul iṣṣinū qutrinnu 

   
Line 5: This line begins with a standard self-introduction formula. The remainder of 
line 5 through the end of line 6 constitutes a sort of complaint, informing the addressee of 
the  supplicant’s  condition.  Complaints  frequently  follow  the  self-introduction.  NENNI  = 
annanna, “so and so.” Annanna serves as a place marker for the name and patronymic of 
the petitioner who employs the stock prayer. A = māru, “son.” Kišpū, “sorcery, witchcraft.” 
Ṣubbutu  (D  of  ṣabātu),  “to  sieze.”  Ṣubbutūʾinni  is a  D  3mp  “active stative”  (or  “transitive 
parsāku”; see Heuhnergard § 33.2) plus 1cs accusative suffix. It is formally identical to the 
predicative construction. One might expect the accusative to be –ninni, but the form with-
out the initial n is often found in SB Akkadian (see GAG §84d and Verbalparadigma 12a, 
n.6 on p. 11*). The alef placed after the verb and before the pronominal suffix convention-

Line 6: Upšāšû (upšaššû), “magical intrigues, sorcery.” Laʾābu, “to afflict.” Leʾbūʾinni is 
a G 3mp active stative or transitive parsāku construction plus 1cs accusative suffix. Line 6 
is subordinate to the ša in line 5; thus, upšāšê leʾbūʾinni is in apposition to kišpī ṣubbutūʾinni. 

upšāšê leʾbūʾinni 

   
Line  7:  BÚR  =  paṭāru,  “to  release,  to  loosen.”  Puṭrī  is  a  G  fs  impv.  Puššuru  (D  of 
pašāru), “to dispel, to disperse, to release.” Pušširī is a D fs impv.  Ruḫû,  “sorcery, witch-
craft.” The petition proper begins in this line. Note also that alongside the petition itself is 
a  renewed  invocation  of  salt.  The  verbs  paṭāru  and  pašāru  are  common  in  incantations 
against sorcery and their accompanying rituals. As attested in the accompanying ritual to 
this  text,  release  is attempted in this  case  through  the  recitation  of  the salt incantation-
prayer  as  a  part  of  a  fumigation  rite  that  features  a  lump  of  salt.  In  other  instances  in 
Maqlû, the afflicted patient burns an effigy of the witch and warlock responsible for their 
torment (e.g., I 135–143). In some cases, the incantation texts portray witchcraft as physi-
cally binding the patient, and various metaphors for release dramatize the victim’s libera-
tion. See, e.g., Maqlû V 51ff., 95–97, which characterize witchcraft as a binding to be bro-
ken, peeled like garlic, and released like a string. 

puṭrī kišpīya ṭābtu pušširī ruḫêya 

   
Line 8: Maḫāru, “to receive, take upon oneself.” Muḫrīnnī-ma is a G fs impv. plus 1cs 
accusative suffix and enclitic –ma. GIM = kīma, “like, as.” Banû, “to build, make.” Bānīya is 
a G ms participle (genitive case) with a 1cs possessive suffix. It is functioning attributively 
in relation to ili, “god.” “The god who made me” is an epithet for the personal god. Other 
similar epithets for the personal god include “the god who guards you” (ilu nāṣirka), “the 
god who provides good health” (ilu  mušallimu), and “the god at my side” (ila aḫīya). For 
references to these different epithets, see CAD I/J, 100. For discussion of the personal god, 
see page 431 in this book. Note that kīma ili bānīya should be read syntactically with the 
verb in line 9.  

upšāšê muḫrīnnī-ma kīma ili bānīya 

 
Line 9:  Šamāru,  “to  praise.”  Lultammarki  is a  Gtn 1cs  precative  plus  2fs  suffix  (–št– 
often becomes –lt– in SB Akkadian texts). Across literary genres, šamāru appears primarily 
in the Gt stem, which has led to some debate over the productivity of the iterative stem for 
this verb. Mayer, however, does take šamāru as Gtn here (UFBG, 323). It should also be 
noted that the promise of praise that closes the shuilla-type incantation-prayer is at times 
accompanied by modifiers such as  ana dārâti “forever,” which is conceptually parallel to 
the iterative aspect of the Akkadian –tan– stems. For examples of the uses of šamāru in the

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

Though there are no prayers addressed to cultic agents in the Hebrew Bible, 
there are still important resonances between this prayer and religious phenome-
na from ancient  Israel and Judah. The various uses for salt attested across the 
ancient Near East correspond closely with those described in the Hebrew Bible. 
For  example,  biblical  texts  reference  salt  as  a  flavor  enhancer  (Job  6:6,  Ezra 
4:14, 6:9) and medicine (Ezek 16:4). Priestly sacrificial rules require the applica-
tion of salt to food offerings presented to the deity (Lev 2:13, Num 18:19, Ezek 
43:24). Salt is also added to biblical incense offerings (Exod 30:35), employed as 
a  healing  agent  in  prophetic  magic  (2  Kgs  2:20–22),  and  dispersed  as  part  of 
cursing rituals (Deut 29:20–26).1 

The conceptualization of sacrifice as the food meant to solicit divine favor is 
especially prominent in the opening address of this prayer. Within the Hebrew 
Bible, a similar view obtains (see, e.g., Lev 3:11, 16; 21:6, 8, 17, 21, 22; 22:25; 
Num 28:2, 24; Ezek 44:7, 16; Mal 1:6–12), although there is also some attempt 
to rebut this conception of sacrifice (e.g., Ps 50:12–13). In the case of Ps 50, by 
offering  a  polemic  against  sacrifice  as  divine  food,  the  psalmist  reinforces  the 
normative status of this understanding.2  
 
1  The relation between salt and curse—and by extension, salt and covenant—has been explored 
extensively within biblical studies. See, e.g., F. Charles Fensham, “Salt as Curse in the Old Tes-
tament and the Ancient Near East,” BA 25 (1962), 48–50; H. Eising, “
,” TDOT 8:331–33 (at 
333). For broader connections between salt and covenant and especially sacrificial aspects, see 
Baruch A. Levine, Leviticus (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of 
America, 1989), 13; Idem, Numbers 1–20 (AB 4; New York: Doubleday, 1993), 449;  and Jacob 
Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16 (AB 3; New York: Doubleday, 1991), 191–92.

The conception of the personal god as the individual’s creator finds a close

,  “the  LORD, 
your maker and creator, who has helped you from the womb”), Prov 14:31 ( ק ֵשֹׁע

also  noteworthy  because  it  applies  the  intimate  epithets  of  the  personal  god, 
with singular possessives, to the collective exilic community (see also Isa 45:9,

As  for  the  promise  of  praise,  texts  such  as  Ps  44:9,  115:18,  119:64,  and 
145:2 emphasize iterative praise of the deity akin to the promise in this prayer.

A Ritual and Incantation-Prayer  

against Ghost-Induced Illness: Shamash 73 

DUANE SMITH 

SHAMASH:  

For the ancient Mesopotamians, Shamash (Akk.) or Utu (Sum.) was the dei-
fied sun.1 He brought light and warmth to the world and its inhabitants during 
the  day.  It  was  in  this  capacity  that  Shamash  brought  life  to  the  world  and 
caused plants to grow.  At night, he surveyed the underworld. While the serrated 
blade, sometimes called a saw, commonly appears in depictions of Shamash, the 
winged  solar  disk  is  his  most  common  iconographic  symbol.2  His  anthropo-
morphic image is that of a bearded old man, sometimes seated, often with solar 
rays  emanating  from  his  shoulders  and  holding  a  scepter  and/or  his  serrated 
blade.3 His divine number is 20. Shamash, the twin brother of the goddess Ishtar 
(Inana), was the son of Sin (Nanna). His mother is Ningal and his consort is Aya. 
 
1  It is often difficult to conceptualize the relationship between the nature of the astrological gods 
as divine beings and their nature as the celestial bodies with which the ancients identified them. 
For  many  of  them,  including  Shamash,  this  conceptual  difficulty  extends  to  them  having  an 
anthropomorphic representation while at the same time being associated with a celestial body.  
On these difficulties see JoAnn Scurlock, Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-induced Illnesses 
in Ancient Mesopotamia (Ancient Magic and Divination 3; Leiden: Brill, 2006), 77 and her several 
references. The prayer discussed here well illustrates this point in lines 21–25 as does line 3 of 
Shamash 1 (see page 370).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Archaeologists have uncovered temples for Shamash at Sippar and at Larsa, both 
named  É-babbar,  “shining  house.”  He  also  shared  a  temple  with  Sin  at  Ashur.  
While the importance of Utu/Shamash waxed and waned over time,4 Sumerian 
and Akkadian texts give witness to his worship from the earliest times until late 
in the history of Mesopotamia.  

Because  Shamash  could  survey  the  earth  by  day  and  the  underworld  by 
night—and therefore nothing could remain hidden from him, he was revered as 
the god of truth and justice, who corrected injustice and mitigated the portents 
of evil omens.5 In the epilogue of the Code of Hammurabi, for example, Shamash 
is  called  dayyānim  rabîm  ša  šamê  u  erṣetim  (xxiv  85–86),  “the  great  judge  of 
heaven and earth.” The bas-relief on the upper part of the Code’s stele depicts 
Hammurabi before Shamash. The attribution of law and justice to Shamash ap-
peared long before Hammurabi. The epilogue to the Laws of Lipit-Ishtar, c. 1939 
BCE, reads in part, “in accordance with the true word of the god Utu, I made the 
lands of Sumer and Akkad hold fair judicial procedure.”6 

Ancient  texts  compare  the  kings  Ur-Nammu,  Amar-Sin,  Lipit-Ishtar,  Ham-
murabi, and Zimri-Lim to Utu/Shamash.7 He was the protector of several heroes 
including  Gilgamesh.8  More  than  many  other  gods,  Shamash  involved  himself 
positively  in  the  affairs  of  humans,  in  which  he  seemed  to  have  considerable 
interest.  

THE PRAYER:  

 
The most complete witness  to Shamash 73 includes the incantation-prayer 
as part of a ritual (Scurlock’s MS A [BAM 323: 1–38]). This textual witness will 
anchor our treatment here.9 The purpose of the ritual is to cure diseases induced

Similar  passages  may  have  been  part  of  the  even  earlier “Law  of  Ur-Namma”  (A  i  1–30;  A  iii

by  an  eṭemmu  (“ghost”),  an  evil  alû-demon,  or  a  mukīl  rēš  lemutti-demon.  The 
text, at the highest level, has the structure of a conditional instruction. The ritual 
functions as an extended apodosis addressing the condition in the brief protasis. 
The ritual includes various ritual preparations and a performance of two incan-
tation-prayers,  one  by  an  āšipu,  “exorcist,”  and  the  other,  Shamash  73,  by  the 
marṣu, “diseased person, patient.” Although the second prayer is our focus, the 
full ritual instructions are included here. 
 
The conditional instruction structure is a common feature of most Mesopo-
tamian  “magico-medical”  texts.10  As  with  many  other  ancient  Mesopotamian 
rituals designed to treat ghost-induced diseases, this ritual seeks to transfer the 
offending  ghost  from  the  infected  person  to  a  specially  prepared  figurine  and 
then to bury that figurine along with the ghost it now embodies in an appropri-
ate place.  
The ritual begins by providing rather specific instructions to the practitioner 
 
who is addressed in the second person: “you gather. . . .” Nowhere does the text 
clearly provide a title for this second person practitioner. Line 11 introduces an 
āšipu in the third person: “He places. . . .” This āšipu performs a short but poign-
ant incantation. In line 17, the text returns to the second person, “you set up,” 
and provides further instructions, presumably to the practitioner of the first six-
teen lines. Is the practitioner that the text  addresses in the second person  also 
the  third  person  āšipu  of  lines  11–16?  It  is  not  possible  to  be  certain.  JoAnn 
Scurlock  argues  that  they  are  the  same  person.  Texts  of  this  broad  type  that 
specify the participants generally mention only an āšipu and a marṣu.11 However, 
three  related  texts  indicate  the  participation  of  āšipu  and  asû,  “physician,”  as 
practitioners in rituals intended to cure a person  of a ghost-induced disease. If 
there is only one practitioner in our text, the shift from second person to third 
person and back to second person may indicate that the text is composite. As we 
will see, there are other possible indications that this ritual was stitched together 
from various loosely-related or previously-unrelated sources.  
 
The conditional instruction begins with a protasis listing illness sources for 
which  the  following  ritual,  the  apodosis  or  the  instruction,  is  prescribed.  The 
practitioner is to construct a figurine and outfit it with various attire and provi-
sions. This figurine is placed on the roof of the patient’s house and libated with a 
mixture of grain flour mixed into water and beer. Slivers of cedar and a magic 
 
new tablet provides an important duplicate to the ritual instructions. Reference to these witness-
es will be noted occasionally as seems necessary. 
10  “Magico-medical” is adopted from Scurlock’s Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-Induced 
Illnesses in Ancient Mesopotamia, in which she studies over three hundred texts dealing with vari-
ous ghost-induced illnesses.

and Karel van der Toorn; Ancient Magic and Divination 1; Groningen: Styx, 1999), 69–79, here 
more specifically 70–71 and 75.

circle  are  placed  around  it.  The  practitioner  then  covers  the  figurine  with  an 
unfired fermenting vat. For three days and nights, the covered figurine is to be 
left outdoors while an exorcist (āšipu) places loaves and juniper censers by day 
(ana pāni Šamaš) and pours out emmer flour by night (ana pāni kakkabī mūšītim). 
Day and night, the exorcist recites a short incantation directed at the ghost. In 
the evening of the third day, the practitioner must prepare a ritual before Sha-
mash. The patient then raises the figurine and recites the incantation that is the 
principle  subject  of  this  treatment.  Following  this  incantation,  the  practitioner 
must place the figurine in a pot and bind it by an oath. The ritual ends with the 
instructions to “bury it in abandoned wastelands.” 
 
Under  the  guidance  and  instruction  of  the  practitioner  (kīam  tušadbabšu, 
“you shall make him recite as follows”), the patient recites the longest incanta-
tion-prayer of the ritual, Shamash 73. One of the textual witnesses to the prayer 
lacks any associated ritual (Scurlock’s MS C). The existence of this tablet suggests 
that the prayer circulated independently of the ghost ritual. For this reason, it is 
possible that a compiler simply plugged the prayer into the ritual. This may ac-
count for the apparent differences between the description of the disease in the 
protasis of the ritual (“ghost,” “an evil alû-demon or a mukīl rēš lemutti-demon”) 
and the description in lines 29 and 30 of the prayer (“an utukku-demon, a rābiṣu 
demon, a ghost, a lilû-demon, paralysis, dizziness, numbness of the flesh, vertigo, 
stiffness, [and] confusion”). Only eṭemmu, “ghost,” is common between them.  
 

The structure of the prayer is as follows: 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

A) The god’s name and honorific titles (19–22) 
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (23–27a) 

I) Invocation 
 
 
II) Petition 
 
 
 
 
III) Conditional call for agreement and rejoicing (34b–35) 

A) Self-introduction (27b) 
B) Acknowledgement of reverential stance vis-a-vis the god (27c) 
C) Lament (28–30) 
D) Plea (31–34a) 

The invocation first calls on Shamash by name and by several of his honorif-
ic  titles.  These  highlight  his  role  among  the  gods  and  among  people.  It  then 
praises  his  various  talents.  He  is  judge,  bringer  of light  and  warmth  to  all  hu-
mankind and even to the animals. The invocation takes up the important theme 
of  judge  a  second  time.  Here  the  supplicant  reminds  Shamash  that  he  makes 
right the verdicts of the wronged man and woman. The invocation thus sets the 
stage for the petition. The petition itself begins with a common formulaic self-
introduction  that  leads  directly  to  a  lament  in  which  the  supplicant  recounts 
their condition: exhausted and bound (iʾiltu iʾʾilanni, “a binding has bound me”) 
by an angry god or goddess. Here, with reference to ritual behavior, the suppli-
cant  indicates  that  they  are  standing  before  Shamash.  The  prayer  unfolds  the 
details of how they are bound. At this point, the plea, returning to the theme of 
Shamash as judge, calls on Shamash to render a verdict in the supplicant’s case

201

and to do it without delay. Referring back to binding, the prayer asks that Sha-
mash not take up any other case until the supplicant’s binding (iʾiltī, “my bind-
ing”) is released. With the repetition of similar language, the prayer closely ties 
the lament and plea together. The prayer ends by calling on the gods to agree 
with Shamash’s verdict and for both the heavens and the earth to celebrate his 
granting of the supplicant’s plea.

Line 1:  DIŠ = šumma, “if.” NA = amīlu (awīlum), “man.” Magico-medical texts often 
open with the words šumma amīlu. Amīlu is the antecedent to the pronominal suffix on the 
verb (–šu). GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost.” See JoAnn Scurlock and Burton R. Andersen, Diagno-
ses in Assyrian and Babylonian Medicine: Ancient Sources, Translations, and Modern Medical 
Analyses (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2005), 436–37, 441, 455–56 on eṭemmu as a 
disease symptom. DAB = ṣabātu, “seize, take hold.” Note that –tš– (the last radical of the 
root and the first letter of the pronominal suffix) becomes –ss–. The –ma serves here as a 
conjunctive particle. UŠ = redû, “to accompany, pursue” In this case the MEŠ indicates an 
iterative  form  of  the  verb,  the  Gtn:  riteddû,  “to  pursue,  to  chase  constantly.”  Lū  .  .  .  lū, 
“either . . . or.” A.LÁ = alû, a kind of demon. ḪUL = lemnu, “evil,” is an adj. that modifies 
alû.  The  reconstruction  of  the  last  three  words  of  the  line  follows  the  new  duplicate 
Sm.1118.

Line 2: SAG.<ḪUL>.ḪA.ZA = sagḫulḫazû-demon or mukīl rēš lemutti-demon. Scurlock, 
based on syllabic spellings, prefers the latter reading (533). Mimma, “anything, something, 
everything.” SU = zumru, “body.” ZI= nasāḫu, “to remove, to expel.” The last four words 
again  follow  Sm.1118.  The  infinitive  at  the  end  of  the  line  provides  the  purpose  of  the 
ritual: to remove (all the evil) from his body. See lines 14 and 16 below. 
lū mukīl rēš lemutti iṣbassu lū mimma lemnu iṣbassu ina zumrīšu nasāḫi 

Line 3: SAḪAR = eperu, “dust, earth, soil.” URU = ālu, “city.” ŠUB = nadû, “abandoned, 
deserted.” Note the phonetic complement –i indicating the adj., nadî; therefore, the phrase 
āli nadî is in the genitive and eper, from eperu, must be a bound form. This structure con-
tinues throughout this line and the beginning of the next. É = bītu, “house.” É DINGIR = bīt 
ili, “house of a god, temple.” KI.MAḪ = kima(ḫ)ḫu (kimāḫu), “tomb,” a Sumerian loanword. 
KIŠI8 = kulbābu, “ant.” “Dust of an ant” is probably to be rendered “dust from anthill” (see 
CAD K, 502). The last word is attested clearly on Sm.1118. 

eper āli nadî eper bīti nadî eper bīt ili nadî eper kimaḫi nadî eper kulbābi 

Line 4: ÍD = nāru, “river, canal.” “Canal” is preferable here because the other sources 
of dust from abandoned places are man-made.  KASKAL = ḫarrānu, “road.”  1-niš = ištēniš, 
“together.” TI = leqû, “to gather, to obtain, to take something in hand.” KI = itti, “with.” 
ÚŠ = dāmu, “blood.” GU4 = alpu, “bull, ox.” ḪE.ḪE = bullulu (D of balālu), “to mix (up).” NU 
= ṣalmu, “figurine, image.” DÙ = epēšu, “to make, to build.” Were it not for the phonetic 
complement, one might be tempted to read DÙ as banû, perhaps the more common verb in 
these contexts. See CAD B, 86–87. 

eper nāri nadīti eper ḫarrāni ištēniš teleqqe itti dām alpi tuballal ṣalam mimma lemnu tep-
puš 

Line 5: KUŠ = mašku, “skin.” UR.MAḪ = nēšu, “lion.” A variant reads alpu, “bull,” here 
instead. MU4.MU4 = lubbušu (D of labāšu), “to provide with clothing.” Note that –šš– (the 
last  radical  of  the  root  and  the  first  letter  of  the  3ms  pronominal  suffix)  becomes  –ss–. 
NA4.GUG = sāmtu, “carnelian, (red stone).” È = šakāku, “to string, to thread.” The context 
requires  that  ina  be  understood  as  “around,”  within  the  semantic  range  of  “on” in  such 
contexts.  GÚ  =  kišādu,  “neck.”  GAR  =  šakānu,  “to  put,  to  place.”  KUŠ.A.GÁ.LÁ  =  narūqu, 
“bag,”  perhaps  “leather  bag”  (see  CAD  N/1,  379,  AHW,  749).  The  typical  contents  of  a 
narūqu  are  dry  goods,  flour,  barley,  bread,  textiles,  hides,  or  the  like.  A  variant  reads 
KUŠ.A.EDIN.LÁ  =  nādu,  “waterskin,”  here.  While  nādu  often  denotes  a  “waterskin,”  it  too 
means leather bag in some contexts (see CAD N/1, 100, AHW, 702). ZÌ.KASKAL = ṣidītu, “(tra-

the image with water and food. 

 mašak nēši tulabbassu sāmta tašakkak ina kišādīšu tašakkan narūqa ṣidīssu 

Line 6: Ṣudû, “rations, provisions.” SUM = nadānu, “to give.” UD = ūmu, “day.” As a 
determiniative, KÁM, generally follows an ordinal number. Therefore,  UD.N.KÁM, generally 
means “the Nth day.” But here, as in some other cases, it surely means “for N days.” Per-
haps we should read  UD.3.KÁM here as šalāš umī. Notice that  UD.3.KÁM is not preceded by 
ina nor is there an indication of the plural (compare the expression in lines 11 and 17). ŠUK 
= kurummatu, “food ration,” was often barley or flour. ÚTUL = diqāru, “serving bowl.” On 
ṣerpētu (ṣirpētu), see CAD Ṣ, 208: “a dish made with barley and milk or fat.”  IGI = pānu 
“front, face (pl).” Ana pānīšu means “before/in front of him (or it).” 

u ṣudê taddaššu UD.3.KÁM 9 kurummassu diqār ṣerpēti ana pānīšu tašakkan 

Line 7: ÙR = ūru, “roof.” LÚ.GIG = marṣu, “sick person, patient.” GUB= šuzuzzu (Š of 
i/uzuzzu), “to make stand, to set up.” Tušazzassu is a 2ms Š durative (tušazzaz) plus a 3ms 
pronominal suffix (–šu). The –zš– cluster becomes –ss–. The –ma, both here and later in this 
line,  is  conjunctive,  “and  then.”  ZÌ  =  qēmu,  “flour.”  ŠE.SA.A  =  qalītu  or  labtu,  “parched 
grain”  (on  labtu,  see  CDA,  175).  The  use  of  flour  from  parched  grain  is  part  of  various 
rituals; see CAD Q, 59 for other examples. A = mû, “water.” KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” SÌG = 
maḫāṣu, “to beat, to weave” here “to stir.” BAL = naqû, “to pour as a libation.”  

ina ūr bīt marṣi tušazzassū-ma qēm qalīti ina mê u šikari tamaḫḫaṣ-ma tanaqqīšu 

Line 8:  GIŠ.EREN.NA = erēnu, “cedar.” Siltu, “sliver, chip (of wood).” Itû, “boundary.” 
Itâtīšu  is  the  fp  with  a  3ms  pronominal  suffix;  it  literally  means  “its  boundaries”  but  is 
being used here as a preposition (see CDA, 137), “all around it.” Zuqqupu (D of zaqāpu), 
“to plant, to erect.”

Line  9:  Zisurrû,  “magic  circle;”  such  magic  circles  were  often  made  with  (barley) 
flour. See CAD Z, 138.  NIGIN =  lamû (lawûm), “to encircle.”  DUG.NÍG.DÚR.BÙR = namzītu, 
“fermenting vat.” NU = lā, “not.” AL.ŠEG6.GÁ should be read ṣarpu when used with earthen-
ware,  “refined,  fired,”  as does  CAD  Ṣ,  113.  It  is  not as  likely  to be  read  bašlu,  “cooked, 
heat-treated,” which tends not to be used with earthenware.

Line 10: UGU = eli, “over.” Kuttumu (D of katāmu), “to cover (with).” UD.BI is probably 
a Sumerogram complex for “his day,” Akk., ūmīšu. The pronoun likely refers to Shamash. 
dUTU = Šamaš. Amāru, “to see.” GE6 = mūšu, “night.” MUL.MEŠ = kakkabū, “stars.” 

elīšu tukattam ina ūmīšu namzīta Šamaš līmuršu ina mūši kakkabū līmurūšu 

Line 11: MAŠ.MAŠ = āšipu, “exorcist.” NINDA.ḪI.A = akalu, “loaf, bread.” NÍG.NA = nig-
nakku, “censer.” The reading of 23 loaves and one censer follows Sm.1118. Scurlock’s MS A 
does  not  mention  loaves,  as  she  reads  it,  but  requires  22  censers  to  be  set  up  (22 
NÍG.NA.NÍG.NA = 22 nignakkū; note that the duplication of the logogram must be taken as an 
indication  of  the  plural).  ŠIM.LI  =  burāšu,  “juniper  tree.”  Note  the  change  in  subject  to 
third person; the āšipu introduced in this line performs the action. What, if anything, does 
this change in person indicate?  

UD.3.KÁM āšipu ūmi mūši 23 akalī nignak burāši ana pāni Šamaš išakkan 

Line  12:  ÁŠ.A.AN  or  ZÍZ.ÀM  (as  Scurlock  reads  it)  =  kunāšu,  “emmer.”  GE6-tim  = 

mūšītim, gen. “of night-time.” DUB = sarāqu, “to strew, to sprinkle.” 

ina mūši qēm kunāši ana pāni kakkabī mūšītim isarraq 

Line 13: Here ana pāni Šamaš u kakkabī means “day and night” but divine connota-
tions should not be discounted. Ana muḫḫi here means “over (it),” with the “it,” referring 
to the figurine’s ritual arrangement, implied. Mitannû (Gtn of manû), “to count repeatedly, 
to recite repeatedly.” On the reading of the verb as imtanannu (3cs Gtn durative), see Scur-
lock, 533. 

ana pāni Šamaš u kakkabī UD.3.KÁM ana muḫḫi imtanannu 

Line 14: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, spell, ritual wording.” This indicates to the user of 
the tablet that the instructions turn now to what he should recite. This first incantation is 
very brief, making it easy to recite repeatedly as prescribed in line 13. Ištu, “from.” Annî, 
“this”  (gen.).  NENNI  A  NENNI  =  annanna  mar  annanna,  “so-and-so,  son  of  so-and-so,” is a 
common placeholder for the actual name of the supplicant in prayers. Sometimes an even 
longer identification formula including the name  of a  personal god and goddess is used. 
See also lines 27 below.  ZI= nasāḫu, see line 2; the form is a 2ms predicative (as is the 
next three verbs). Šūṣû (Š of [w]aṣû), “to make go out, to dismiss, to expel.”

Line  15:  Ṭarādu,  “to  send  away,  to  drive  away.”  Kuššudu  (D  of  kašādu),  “to  drive 
away, to chase off.” Šākikka is a ms participle (šākin) with a 2ms pronominal object suffix 
(–ka).  The  n  of  the  root  assimilates to  the  following  consonant.  The  same is  true  in  the 
fem. participle in the following line. 
ṭardāta u kuššudāta ilu šākikka 

Line 16:  d15 = ištaru, “goddess.”  d15 is often used in parallel with ilu (see CAD I/J, 
272). GIG = marṣu, “sick person, patient.” Issuḫūka is a 3mp G preterite (with 2ms pronom-
inal suffix) from nasāḫu (see line 2 and 14). This is the last line of the first incantation. 

ištaru šākittaka ina zumur annanna mar annanna marṣa issuḫūka 

Line  17:  The  ritual  instructions  resume.  On  ina  UD.3.KÁM,  see  the  note  on  line  6. 
UD.GURUM.MA  =  qiddat  ūmi,  “late afternoon, evening.” In  the first  instance,  KEŠDA  repre-
sents a noun in the accusative, riksa, “ritual arrangement.” On contextual and syntactical 
grounds, the second instance of KEŠDA must be the verb tarakkas from rakāsu, “to bind, to 
prepare,  to  set  up.”  The  noun  and  the  verb  have  the  same  root  and  appear  together  in 
similar phrases. See CAD R, 351. Notice the return to the second person, indicated more 
explicitly in line 18. 

ina UD.3.KÁM qiddat ūmi riksa ana pāni Šamaš tarakkas 

Line 18:  ÍL  =  našû,  “to  raise.” Šudbubu  (Š  of  dabābu),  “to  make  someone  speak,  to 
make someone recite aloud.” Expressions like this are common ritual instructions for pray-
ers.  See,  e.g.,  ṣalma šuātu  tanaššī-ma  kīam  taqabbi, “you lift up  that  image and say this,” 
cited in CAD N/2, 83. 

marṣu ṣalma inaššī-ma ana pāni Šamaš kīam tušadbabšu 

Line 19: The second incantation, Shamash 73, begins here. As is expected, the suppli-
cant’s prayer begins with an invocation and hymnic praise. Muttallu (muttellu), “princely, 
noble.” Anunnakkū is a collective name from Sumerian that likely originally specified all 
the gods of the pantheon but later, and particularly in Akkadian contexts, may only refer 
to gods of earth and the underworld (See Black and Green, 34). Etellu, “pre-eminent, lord.” 
On the connotation of etellu as applied to the younger gods, see CAD E, 383. Igigî refers to 
the  lesser  gods  of  the  pantheon.  Massû,  “leader,  expert.”  Ṣīru,  “first  rank,  supreme,  out-
standing.” Muttarrû, “leader, guide,” has  the form of a Gtn participle from  arû (see CAD 
A/2, 314). Despite the nom. case ending, the word is bound to the following noun in the 
gen. Tenēšētu (pl), “people, humankind.”

Line 20: Dayyānu, “judge.” AN = šamû, “heaven.” KI = erṣetu, “earth.” Dayyān šamê u 
erṣetim is a very common and old epithet for Shamash. This epithet is particularly poignant 
as part of this prayer. It is echoed in line 31, part of the petition, Šamaš dayyānu attā. In 
lines 31–33 the supplicant prays for an immediate “verdict” in his case. Enû, “to change, to 
shift,  to  revoke.”  The  negated  infinitive  describes a  quality  of  Shamash.  Qibītu,  “speech, 
command.” Qibītuššu includes the locative-adverbial ending –um plus the 3ms pronominal 
suffix (–šu). The m assimilates to the š of the suffix. Although we may expect qibīssu here 
(as a variant suggests), the locative-adverbial ending does stand sometimes in place of the 
accusative (see GAG §66f). 

dayyān šamê u erṣeti lā enû qibītuššu 

Line 21: Muštēšir is a Št lex. participle (ms) from ešēru, “to cause to straighten, to put 
in order.” Ekletu, “darkness.” The idea here is that Shamash puts the darkness in order. See 
CAD N/2, 349. Šākin from šakānu is a G participle. Nūru, “light.” Nišū, “people.” 

Šamaš muštēšir ekleti šākin nūri ana nišī 

Line 22: Erēbu, “to enter,” but with reference to the sun, “to set.” The pronominal suf-
fix becomes the subject of the infinitive’s action: “in your setting.” ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.” 
Uteṭṭû (Dt of eṭû), “to be darkened.” Aṣû (waṣûm), “to go out,” but with reference to the 
sun, “to rise.” Namāru (nawārum),  “to  be(come) bright, to shine.” Kibrātu, “the regions,” 
specifically the four regions of the earth, the four edges or shores, that is, the whole world.  

Šamaš ina erēbīka nūr nišī ūtaṭṭi Šamaš ina aṣîka inammirā kibrāti 

Line 23:  Ekû  (m),  ekūtu  (f),  “impoverished,  orphaned.”  Almattu,  “widow.”  Here and 
elsewhere in this text, the mimation is archaic and almost certainly aphonemic and likely 
aphonetic  in  which  case  the  signs  should  perhaps  be  read  tu4  or  tì,  as  appropriate.  The 
reason for reading these signs tum and tim is that elsewhere in the text the signs TU and TI 
are  used  for  tu  and  ti.  On  kigullatu,  “waif(?),”  see  AHw,  474  and  CAD  K,  349–50.  Ruttu 
(rūtu), “female associate, companion.” This line serves to indicate that the kala abrātu in 
the next line includes even the most disenfranchised elements of humanity. 

ekūtu almattu kigullatu u ruttu  

Line 24:  Ṣītu, “exit,” but with regard to the sun, “rising.” Šutaḫḫunu (Dt of šaḫānu), 
“to be warmed up.” The form is a 3fp durative. Kala, “all.” Abrātu, “humankind” appears 
only in the pl. See CAD A/1, 62.

Line 25: Būlu, “beasts,” and ašû, “animals,” are common synonyms. See CAD Ṣ, 114. 
ZI = napištu. Šiknat napišti are “living creatures,” an idiom based on šakānu, “to place, to 
put,” and napištu, “life, vitality.” See CAD Š/2, 436. Ṣēru, “steppe, open country.”  

būlu šiknat napišti ašû ṣēri  

Line  26:  Ittabbulu  (Gtn  of  [w]abālu),  “to  carry  constantly,  to  bring  constantly.”  The 
form is a 3fp durative plus a 2ms pronominal suffix. Napšāssina is the fp of napištu with a 
3fp  pronominal suffix. But the  word could  be read differently. For example, Seux (426), 
following AHw, 698, reads nablāṭsina from nablāṭu, “healing, life giving.” The final word, 
meš-re-ta, is also ambiguous. Is it a variant of mašrītu, “riches” (AHw, 629), as adopted by 
Seux  (427) and  Foster  (731),  or is  it  mešrêtu,  “limbs,” as Scurlock  (535) and  von  Soden 
(323) suggest? Should we understand this as a reference to sacrifice? 

ittanabbalāka napšassina mešrêta 

Line 27: The two halves of this double line straddle the hymnic introduction and the 
petition section of the prayer, thereby providing a transition between the sections. The line 
begins by calling on Shamash in his role as judge, a role that is directly applicable to the 
petition. It recalls Shamash’s epithet as dayyān šamê u erṣetim in line 20. The first part of 
this line summarizes the previous lines of the petition. It then identifies the petitioner via a 
standard  self-introduction  formula.  Dīnu,  “case,  judgment.”  Ḫablu  (m),  ḫabiltu  (f), 
“wronged  person.”  While  it  is  possible  to  understand  ḫablu  as  “oppressed,”  “wronged” 
seems  to work  better in the  context of  this prayer. Dânu (diānum), “to  judge.”  EŠ.BAR  = 
purussû, “verdict, decision.” Purussû is commonly used in the context of verdicts from the 
gods. Given the medical context of this prayer, we might call the god’s verdict a prognosis; 
but for the Mesopotamian, a god’s decision, even with regard to an illness, is ultimately 
legal in nature. Šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to put in order, to clear up, to provide justice.” 
The form is 2ms durative. Šūnuḫu, “exhausted, troubled.” The adjective is used substanti-
vally here, “the exhausted one.” This is the first hint of a complaint in the prayer. A string 
of complaints follows in lines 28–30. Kamāsu, “to kneel.” The form is 1cs predicative.  

dīn ḫablim u ḫabilti tadân purussêšina tušteššir 
anāku annanna mar annanna šūnuḫu kamsāku 

Line 28: Šibšātu, “anger, angry rejection.” Ina must mean something like “on account 
of” or “by.” Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, obligation, liability, sin.” Eʾēlu, “to bind.” Iʾʾilanni is a G 
3cs durative with a 1cs pronominal object suffix. The ša introduces a relative clause that 
describes the condition of the supplicant. They are bound due to divine anger, which may 
be the result of some ritual failure but it need not be. Notice the alliteration in this line.

Line 29: UDUG = utukku, “demon, ghost.” MAŠKIM = rābiṣu, “demonic guardian,” see 
CAD R, 23. GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost.” (As a symptom of one or more diseases, see Scurlock 
and Andersen, Diagnoses, 436–37, 441, 455–56; eṭemmu can also be the cause of disease, 
see CAD E, 397.) LÍL.LÁ = lilû, a kind of demon (see CAD L, 190 and Scurlock and Ander-
sen,  Diagnoses,  434–36).  Concerning  ḫimītu  (ḫimittu),  dimītu,  šimmat  šīri  (=  UZU),  and 
ṣīdānu:  the  several  differing  attempts  listed  here  to  provide  definitions  for  these  words

translation will be tentative. 

 utukku rābiṣu eṭemmu lilû ḫimītu dimītu šimmat šīri ṣīdānu 

Line  30:  Šaššaṭu,  “stiff  joints.”  Following  CAD  Ṣ,  171,  Seux  translates  šaššaṭu  as 
“L’arthrite” (427); Scurlock does not translate it at all (535). Scurlock and Andersen sug-
gest that this symptom is  best understood by  the modern  term “tetanus” (Diagnoses, 66–
68).  See  also CAD  Š/2,  175:  [šumma  kišāssu?]  qablāšu  ašṭa  šaššaṭa  MU.NI,  “[If  his  neck?] 
(and) hips are stiff, it is called šaššaṭu” (citing BAM 129 iv 3). Miqittu, “attack.” Ṭēmu here 
means “reason” or the like. Miqit ṭēmi is “an attack on reason.” Šaqālu, “to weigh, to bal-
ance.” Išqulūnim-ma is a G 3mp preterite with a 1cs dative pronominal suffix and an enclit-
ic –ma. In this line we see two different uses of the enclitic –ma. On the verb (išqulūnim-
ma), the –ma functions as a conjunction, binding this sentence with the next. UD = ūmu, 
“day.”  Ūmišam-ma,  “daily,”  from  ūmi  plus  –išam  and  the  enclitic  –ma.  The  –išam  suffix 
often forms distributive adverbs from nouns (see GAG §67g): “day” becomes “daily.” Here 
the  –ma  brings  special  emphasis  to  the  adverb  ūmišam.  The  reading  of  the  final  verb  is 
uncertain  (Scurlock’s  MS  B  has  ú-dam-ma-mu-[.  .  .).  Attempts  to  derive  the  verb  from 
damāmu,  damû,  or  ṭamû  all  flounder  on  morphological  and/or  contextual  grounds.  (The 
capital D’s in the transliteration indicate uncertainty about the value of the dental conso-
nant. Should we read uṭ-ṭam- or ud-dam-?) A scribal error cannot be ruled out.

Line 31: The line comprises three clauses. The first clause is verbless and conveys the 
supplicant’s  confidence  in  Shamash’s  judicial  role.  DI.KUD  =  dayyānu.  Note  that  line  20 
spells  dayyānu  syllabically,  da-a-a-an,  while  here  the  text  uses  a  logogram.  Attā,  “you” 
(ms). The  second clause illustrates the supplicant’s confidence through action.  (W)abālu, 
“to carry, to bring.” Ublakka is the G 1cs preterite (ubil) with a ventive (–am) and a 2ms 
pronominal suffix (–ka). The m of the ventive has assimilated to the k of the pronominal 
suffix (–mk– becomes –kk–). The verb is performative. By speaking it the supplicant per-
forms the implied action (i.e., saying that he brings his life to Shamash actually brings his 
life to Shamash). The final clause is more complex. The first dīnu in the line must mean 
“case, issue” or the like; the second means “judgment, verdict, prognosis.”  GIG = murṣu, 
“sickness, disease.” (This reading follows MS C, see also Seux, 427, n.22; MS A reads LÚ.GIG 
=  marṣu, “patient, sick person.”) The relative clause that follows murṣu defines the sick-
ness further via the verb iṣbatanni. The supplicant is kneeling submissively, the line says, 
waiting for the deity to render a verdict about the case of disease that has seized him. 

Šamaš dayyānu attā-ma napištī ublakka dīnu murṣi ša iṣbatanni ana dīni kamsāku 

Line 32: Dīn is a ms impv. from dânu (see line 27) with a cognate accusative (dīnu). 
The phonetic compliment on EŠ.BAR (-a-a) indicates that purussû ends in a long a. KUD = 
parāsu, “to cut,” but with purussû it means “to render a decision or verdict.” Adi, “until,” 
begins  a  temporal  clause.  Šuršû  (Š  of  rašû),  “to  cause  someone  or  something  to  acquire 
something.” Tušaršû is a 2ms preterite with subjunctive (–u). 

dīnu dīn purussâ purus adi dīnī purussâ tušaršû 
 
Line 33: The text follows Seux in the reading of the first lacuna (see 427, n.23). The 
restoration of the second lacuna follows Scurlock (532). Šanû, “another.” SUM = nadānu, 
“to give, to deliver.” The construction lā tanaddin is a prohibitive, a negative impv. (“do 
not”). The object of the verb follows it. A temporal clause, parallel to the one in line 32, 
begins  with  the  word  ištu  and  introduces  the  prayer’s  concluding  section  of  praise.  The 
basic meanings of the preposition ištu are “from, since;” here it means “after.” (Note that 
MS A reads the earlier form, ištu, while  MS C reads ultu, the later form.) The verb in the 
clause, tušteršû (for tuštaršû), is a 2ms perfect with subjunctive from šuršû (see line 32). 

ana dīni šanîm-ma lā tanaddin purussâšu ištu dīnī purussâ tušteršû 

Line 34:  On  eʾiltu  (iʾiltu), see line 28. This word is the subject  of the following two 
verbs. (W)uššuru (D of [w]ašāru), “to release, to set free.” Although no subjunctive marker 
is present  (due to the  object suffix), this verb is part of the  subordinate  clause from  the 
previous line (beginning with ištu). SU.MU = zumrī, zumru plus 1cs pronominal suffix (Sum. 
MU = –ia5). Naprušu (N, no G stem), “to fly”; in a simile “to flee.” The form is a 3cs perfect

with  subjunctive, indicating  that this  verb also  continues  the subordinate  clause.  Ēm(a), 
“wherever.” Takālu, “to trust.” Mitguru (Gt of magāru), “to agree with one another, to come 
to  an  agreement.”  Pūka,  “your  mouth,  your  word.”  We  expect  pī–  before  a  pronominal 
suffix,  but  pū–  does  occur  in  literature  (see  Scurlock,  533,  citing  AHw,  872).  The  Gt  of 
magāru is reciprocal and thus does not take an object. Pūka therefore must be taken adver-
bially, “(with regard to) your word.” Many translators suspect an error at the end of this 
line, emending it to read likrubūka, “may they bless you” (see Foster, 731, Seux, 427, n.26, 
and implied by von Soden, 324).

Line 35: Ḫadû, “to be joyful.” Râšu (riāšum), “to rejoice.” TU6 ÉN is a common Sumeri-
an formula that marks the end of the incantation, closing out what ÉN in line 19 began. 
Notice  the  reprise  “heaven  and  earth”  thematically  reflecting  the  divine  epithet  of  Sha-
mash as judge of heaven and earth in the invocations to the prayer.

Line 36: Mirroring the language at the end of line 20, kīam tušadbabšu brackets the 
supplicant’s  prayer.  DUG  =  karpatu,  “pot.”  GAR-an  =  tašakkan.  Tummû  (D  of  tamû),  “to 
bind by oath, to make someone swear.” Tutammāšu is a 2ms durative with a 3ms pronomi-
nal  suffix.  The  3ms  pronouns  on  the  verbs  refer  to  the  figurine.  Tutammāšu  introduces 
what  Scurlock  calls  a  “ritual  oath  formula”  (533).  Such  formulae  occur  in  several  ghost 
prescriptions but are far from exclusive to such texts.  

kīam tušadbabšu ana karpati tašakkaššū-ma tutammāšu 

Line 37: Nīšu, “(oath on the) life.” The ritual formula literally reads, “(by) the life of 
the  earth/heaven.”  Lū  expresses  a  wish.  Tamāta  is  a  G  2ms  predicative  from  tamû,  “to 
swear, to adjure.” DU11.GA = qabû, “to say.” We expect a 2ms durative form here.  KÁ = 
bābu, “gate, door;” but since it refers to the jar, it means “opening.” ÚŠ = peḫû, “to block, 
to close, to seal.” 

nīš šamê lū tamāta nīš erṣeti lū tamāta nīš Šamaš lū tamāta taqabbī-ma bābšu tepeḫḫi 

Line 38: Ḫarbu, “desert, wasteland.” Nadûti, from nadû, see line 3. Qebēru, “to bury.” 
Note how the ritual instructions come full circle with the mention of nadû: the abandoned 
dust used to create the figurine is returned to an abandoned place.

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS: 

Tawil demonstrated that Akkadian ṣalmu, “figurine, image” and Hebrew ם ֶל ֶצ

ALCBH, 323). However, in all cases save two, the creation of man (Gen 1:26–27) 
and  the  birth  of  Seth  (Gen  5:3),  the  Hebrew  Bible  views  having,  making,  or 
being a ם ֶל ֶצ negatively. The expression ם ָתֹב ֲוֹת י ֵמ ְל ַצ ְו, “and images of their abomi-
nations,” in Ezek 7:20, and ם ֶכי ֵמ ְל ַצ, “your images,” in Amos 5:26 are examples of 
the negative evaluations of figurines or images. Nowhere does the Hebrew Bible 
clearly refer to a ם ֶל ֶצ as having the same or similar function as the ṣalmu in this 
Akkadian ritual.1

The semantic equivalent of the complete epithet dayyān šamê u erṣeti, “judge

א ֵשׂ ָנּ ִה
ץ ֶר ָא ָה, “judge of the earth rise up,” in Ps 94:2 may reflect the first part of the epi-
thet here applied to Yahweh. The phrase

Gen 18:25 may reflect the same traditional usage.2 On “judge” as a divine epi-
thet in the Hebrew Bible, see Shamash 1 in the comparative suggestions (page 
379).

ANU:  

ӎ⼯⼯ 

A Shuilla: Anu 1 

KYLE GREENWOOD 

Anu is known throughout Mesopotamian mythology as the sky god. The dei-
ty is represented in cuneiform with the AN sign. When this sign is read in Sume-
rian,  it  is pronounced  /an/  and  means  “heaven,”  which  is  the  Sumerian  name 
for the deity (Sum. An; Akk. Anu). The sign is also commonly read in Sumerian 
as  dingir,  which may  refer to  the  generic  word for  “deity,”  Akk.  ilu,  or  as  the 
determinative for any deified being (dDN). In the earliest cuneiform writing, AN 
resembled a star or rosette. 

In  classic  Mesopotamian  mythology  Anu  was  one  of  the  three  highest 
ranked deities, along with Enlil and Ishtar. However, in the Great Hymn of the 
Queen  of  Nippur,  Anu  shares  paternity  with  Enlil  and  Sin.  Anu  possessed  the 
authority to decree and elevate fates. Along with Enlil, Anu was responsible for 
conferring kingship and granting royal authority. Some epithets of Anu include 
šar ilī, “king of the gods”; šar šamê, “king of heaven”; and šar matāti, “king of the 
lands.” 

As is the case with the other celestial deities, Anu is not only the god whose 
dominion is heaven; Anu also represents the heavens themselves. Anu is the an-
tithesis of erṣetu, “earth.” In Atram-ḫasīs, Anu is known as abu, “father,” and the 
aforementioned šar ilī, “king of the gods.” While Anu ascended to heaven, Enlil 
assumed  control  of  the  earth.  The  Sumerian  myth  Gilgamesh,  Enkidu  and  the 
Netherworld  intimates  that  heaven  and  earth  were  once  a  single  entity,  until 
Anu carried off and occupied heaven, and Enlil carried off and occupied earth. 

In the Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, Anu is associated with military action. In this 
epic Anu is said to press miṭṭa lā pādâ elu targīgi “the relentless mace upon the 
wicked.” However, Anu is not typically associated with warfare. Rather, the dei-
ty is  summoned  amid  dire  circumstances  so the  Kassite  king  Kashtiliash might 
feel the full brunt of Assyria’s pantheon. 

Based on the textual and archaeological record, the cult of Anu had limited 
official  geographical  distribution.  Apparently,  Anu  received  limited  homage  in 
Dilbat, Kesh and Ur. However, the deity also appears to have had a dais at É-sag-
íl in Babylon. In Ashur, Anu and Adad shared a long-standing temple that con-
sisted of a pair of ziggurats, one for each deity. Of primary significance, howev-
er, was the Anu cult in Uruk. Anu’s temple, named Bīt Rēš in Akkadian, was one 

 

217

218

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

of two major temple structures, the other one being the temple of Inana. Both 
temples were extensively rebuilt during the Seleucid and Parthian periods. 

In  Mesopotamian  astronomical  tradition,  “the  path  of  Anu”  (ḫarrān  šūt 
Anim) lay  between the “paths” of Enlil and Ea (see page 411 for more on the 
celestial  “paths”).  With  respect  to  iconography,  Anu’s  divine  symbol  is  the 
horned cap. His divine number was 60, the highest among the gods.  

THE PRAYER:  

This prayer to Anu follows the standard tripartite construction of a shuilla. 
The hymnic introduction (lines 1–8a) consists of four parts. The first three parts 
are  organized  in  sets  of  parallel  lines,  following  Sumerian  hymnic  style  (see 
Mayer,  UFBG,  40).  In  each  case,  the  second  line  begins  with  the  vocative  “O 
Anu”  then  repeats  the first  line  verbatim. The  first  of  the four parts  impresses 
upon  the  deity  his  worthiness  to  be  called  upon.  Anu  is  “magnificent”  and  is 
associated with holy purification rites. The second part appeals to Anu’s status in 
the  cosmic  realm.  The  third  and  fourth  parts  of  the  hymnic  introduction  shift 
from appealing to the deity’s generic value as the hearer of prayers to the deity’s 
specific merit for hearing this particular prayer. Not only is Anu the magnificent 
god  of  the  heavens,  but,  more  importantly  to  the  supplicant,  Anu  is  the  deity 
who can remove the afflictions from this persecuted human.  
 
The petition  section  (lines  8b–13)  consists  of  a  series  of five  requests, fol-
lowed by the imperative “have mercy!” There is a sort of rhythmic cadence in 
this section as the prayer moves from the beneficence of the deity to the trans-
gressions  of  the person;  from  the  ferocity  of  the  supplicant’s  personal gods,  to 
the compassion of the magnificent Anu. The petition demonstrates the precari-
ous  nature  in  which  anguished  people  of  the  ancient  world  found  themselves 
with respect to their health and the whims of the gods.  
 
The  prayer  concludes  (lines  14–16)  with  a  section  of  promissory  praise. 
Should Anu  successfully intervene on behalf of the  supplicant, this person will 
reward the deity with riches and honor.  
 
Aside from the use of parallelism in the first section, the prayer employs a 
number of recurring words. For example, bēlu occurs once in each of the first six 
lines  and  once  in  line  15.  Pašāru  occurs  in  participial  form  three  times  in  the 
hymnic  introduction  and  twice  as  a  precative  in  the  petition  section.  In  that 
same section, lemnētu and Ḫaṭâtu appear three times each. These recurring words 
are significant in that they not only influence the themes of their respective sec-
tions, but they also serve to unify the prayer as a cohesive composition. 
 
In the Bīt salāʾ mê purification ritual series this prayer to Anu initiates the 
ninth section (pirsu) of the series, which consists of prayers to multiple deities, 
including  Nusku,  Sin,  Gula  and  Shamash.  The  ritual  itself  was  named  for  the 
location  in  which  it  was  performed,  the  Bīt  salāʾ  mê,  “House  of  Water  Sprin-

 

ӎ⼯⼯ A SHUILLA: ANU 1 

219

kling.” It involved the transfer of evil from the king to its suspected source by 
means of a purification bath.1  

There are three known MSS of this prayer, BMS 6: 1–16 (referred to here as 
MS A), CT 51 211 (MS B), and LKA 50 (MS C). All of these are incomplete, but the 
latter is the best preserved (at least, after line 6). The treatment presented here 
follows the line numbering  of BMS 6 as  a  matter of convenience  (see likewise 
Foster’s translation). The text at the beginning of the prayer is very fragmentary, 
shows signs of scribal errors (especially in MS C), and varies among the sources. 
The  text  of  lines  1–6  presented  here  is,  therefore,  tentative.  With  line  7,  this 
treatment  follows  MS  C.  Even  here,  due  to  the  fragmentary  nature  of  the  text, 
many  reconstructions  are  conjectural.  The  present  text  cannot  substitute  for 
studying the original manuscripts or consulting a new modern edition, which is 
unfortunately still a desideratum.

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of 
the prayer, but is not a part of the  prayer itself.  EN =  bēlu, “master, lord,  ruler.” Šurbû, 
“great, supreme,” is a Š stem verbal adjective from rabû. Note that the superlative form in 
Akkadian, known as the elative, is expressed via the Š verbal adjective. The prayer begins 
appropriately by praising the deity as bēlu šurbû, “most excellent lord.” Ša with a resump-
tive pronoun such as –Šu attached to a noun X is a common grammatical construct mean-
ing “whose X.” Ina šamê (= AN), “in heaven,” reflects Anu’s chief role as god of the heav-
ens. Šuluḫḫu, “purification rite,” usually occurs in the plural, as here (see CAD Š/3, 260). 
Ellū is a G 3mp predicative from elēlu (= KÙ), “to be clean, pure, holy, sacred.”

Line 2: Lines 1–6 consist of three pairs of parallel lines that imitate Sumerian hymnic 
style. Each pair moves from the general to the specific. The first line of each pair addresses 
the deity with a particular epithet. The epithet is repeated verbatim in the second line of 
the  pair,  except  that  the  deity  addressed  is  called  by  name.  Notice  the  retention  of  mi-
mation in the DN Anu, which is otherwise absent in the text. 

Anum bēlu šurbû ša ina šamê šuluḫḫūšu ellū 

   
Line 3: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” MS B begins the line with bēlu instead of ilu. Ṣaddu means 
“sign, signal,” particularly as it pertains to omens. AGA = agû, “crown.” In some texts the 
crown  of  Anu  represents  kingship  in  the  divine  council.  The  title  bēl  agê,  “lord  of  the 
crown,” also underscores Anu’s authority to coronate kings. In the astrological text Astro-
labe B, the crown of Anu is a constellation called is lê, “Jawbone-of-an-Ox.”  

il šamê bēl ṣaddi bēl agê 

   
Line 4: If the connection between Anu and the heavens were not clear from line 1, 
there can be no mistaking the connection in line 4. This relationship is even more striking 
with  the  presence  of  three  DINGIR  signs  in  the  line.  There  is  some  ambiguity—perhaps 
intended—regarding the precise function of the genitive šamê. The options are “heaven’s 
god,” “the heavenly god,” “the god in heaven,” or “the god whose domain is the heavens.” 
MS C seems to have skipped our lines 4 and 5, probably due to parablepsis (homoioarch-
ton). 

Anum il šamê bēl ṣaddi bēl agê 

   
Line 5: Lines 5–8 employ substantive participles to define the attributes of the deity 
that are pertinent to the petitioner’s request. Pašāru, “to release, to loosen.” As is often the 
case with this verb, a deity, in this case Anu, is its agent. Ūmu, “day,” is in the genitive 
case, which is to be expected by the fact that it is preceded by a participle in the bound 
form. The exact meaning of pāšir ūmi, “the one who absolves the day,” is uncertain. One 
suggestion is that it refers to a clearing of the weather (see CAD P, 239). The context of the 
prayer does not warrant such an interpretation here. Rather, the day in question is likely 
the day of suffering, which is the impetus for the prayer. Thus, it likely refers to the re-
moval of that day of suffering from the memory of the supplicant. 

pāšir ūmi bēl ṣaddi bēl agê 

   
Line 6:  MS B attests the start of a fragmentary line between lines 5 and 6 and again 
between lines 6 and 7. In both cases the line reads mukallim ṣaddi, “the one who reveals 
the sign.”

Line 7: MÁŠ.GE6 = šuttu (pl. šunātu), “dream.” ḪUL = lemnu, “bad, evil, wicked.” Ḫaṭû 
(ḫāṭû), “wrong, defective, portending evil.” Pardu, “frightening,” particularly as it pertains 
to  dreams.  Á.MEŠ  =  idātu,  “powers,  signs,  omens.”  GISKIM.MEŠ  =  ittātu,  “marks,  signs, 
omens.” Pāšir is followed by a string of fp genitive nouns and adjectives. The first noun, 
šunāti, is modified by three adjectives, lemnēti, haṭâti, and pardāti. The adjective lemnēti is 
understood  here  as  modifying  both  idāti  and  ittāti,  though  it  is  equally  plausible  that  it 
only modifies the latter. From this line to the end of the prayer, MS C is the textual basis. 
 
   
Line 8: Lines 8 and 9 are problematic from a textual perspective. The present treat-
ment closely follows MS C (cited as an alternate reading in Seux, 271, n.11 and a variant by 
Foster, 640, n.2). Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to cause to pass through, to cross,” thus “to remove, 
to  avert.”  Lumnu,  “evil,  wickedness.”  Ḫiṭītu,  “act  of  negligence,  sin,  offense.”  Gillatu, 
“crime,  misdeed,  sin.”  Maruštu  (maruṣtu,  marṣu,  see  CAD  M/I,  291),  “severe,  grievous.” 
Ḫūṣu, “pain.” GAZ = ḫīpu at its root means “a break,” but this brokenness when applied to 
one’s health connotes “disease, ailment, or affliction.” Ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi is understood idiomati-
cally and may refer to either physical or emotional pain (CAD Ḫ, 260). Originally, ḫūṣ ḫīpi 
libbi was likely a hendiadys, explaining the use of the plural verb (see luptaṭṭirū in line 9). 
The relative ša that follows begins a subordinate clause telling more about this situation in 
terms of the supplicant’s experience. The three verbs in the subordinate clause are plural 
forms. Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be inflicted” (CAD Š/1, 154). The enclitic –ma joins this 
verb with line 9. 

pāšir šunāti lemnēti ḫaṭâti pardāti idāti ittāti lemnēti 

mušēteq lumni ḫiṭīte u gillate marušte ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi ša iššaknū-ma 

 
Line 9:  UŠ.UŠ = riteddû (Gtn of redû), “to guide constantly, to control constantly; to 
persecute continually.” The reduplication of the UŠ sign is an indication of the Gtn. Kussu 
(D of kasû), “to bind.” I take the first two verbs in this line as duratives, showing the ongo-
ing effects of the situation described by iššaknū-ma in line 8. UZU = šīru, “flesh.” TI.LA = 
balāṭu,  “life.”  Tû,  “incantation,  spell.”  Ina  tēka  ša  balāṭi  is  a  formulaic  expression.  Seux 
(271, n.12) suggests ittēka, as preserved in MS C, might be a contraction of ina tēka, which 
is only preserved in MS A. Putaṭṭuru (Dt of paṭāru), “to be loosened, to be released.” The lu– 
prefix usually indicates a 1cs precative but the verb seems to refer back to Ḫūṣ  ḫīpi libbi 
(understood as a plural) and therefore must be a 3cp precative. Therefore, the prefix, only 
attested in MS C from Ashur, is probably an Assyrianism. See GAG §81c on page 132.

Line 10: Mimmû mala, “all that,” introduces a relative clause. Note the 1cs pronomi-
nal suffixes (MU) on ilu and ištaru (=IŠ8.DAR), indicating these are the supplicant’s personal

god  and  goddess.  Ištaru,  rather  than  iltu,  is  used  for  the  personal  goddess  when  parallel 
with ilu (see CAD I/J, 90). Aḫṭû is a G 1cs preterite (aḫṭi) plus subjunctive –u from ḫaṭû, “to 
do  wrong  (ana,  to),  to  sin  (against).”  Lippašra  is  a  3cs  precative  with  the  ventive  from 
napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released.”  

mimmû mala ana ilīya u ištarīya aḫṭû lippašra 

   
Line 11: Zenû, “angry.” The genitive plural form of this adj. indicates it modifies both 
ilu and ištaru. Târu with ašru means, “to return to normal, to subside.” In ancient Mesopo-
tamian  thought,  physical  distress  was  most  often  associated  with  offenses  committed 
against the gods. The only remedy was to appease the gods, confess one’s transgressions, 
and plea for divine  reprieve. Thus, the  request is for freedom from  the physical anguish 
caused by the angry gods. 

libbi ilīya u ištarīya zenūte ana ašrīšu litūr 

   
Line 12: Aggu, “angry.” As is typical in the phrase aggu libbu, aggu assumes the atypi-
cal position of preceding the noun it modifies. Libbu often refers to the heart as the seat of 
the  intellect;  therefore,  “mind,  intent,  choice.”  Note  the  use  of a  2ms  pronominal  suffix 
rather than the 2mp, as we might expect as both god and goddess were previously men-
tioned. Linūḫa is a G 3cs precative with ventive from nâhu, “to be at rest, to relent.”  

aggu libbaka linūḫa 

   
Line 13: Kabattu (kabtatu in poetic texts) is literally a “liver” but it also means “emo-
tions, thoughts, mind, spirit.” It is the subject of lippašra from napšuru, for which see line 
10. Rašû, “to get, to acquire.” The form is a ms impv. with ventive. On the expression rišâ 
rēmu and its variants, see Mayer, UFBG, 225. Having declared Anu as the deity who gener-
ally releases (pašāru) misfortune in line 7, the supplicant now calls upon the deity to make 
those powers effective in this particular case. One should expect rēmu to be in the accusa-
tive case, but the nominative frequently stands for the accusative in SB Akkadian and the 
current form is frequently attested in the idiom, rišâ rēmu, “to show pity; have mercy” (see 
CAD R, 199). 

lippašra kabtatka rišâ rēmu 

   
Line 14: Ṭuḫḫudu (D of ṭaḫādu), “to provide lavishly, to endow richly, to make pros-
perous.” The characteristic doubled second radical in the orthography is missing. However, 
the  a-i vowel  pattern is sufficient to diagnose this form as a D 1 cs precative.  É =  bītu, 
“house.”  The  function  of  both  precatives in  this sentence  is  to  conclude the  petitions  in 
lines 8b–13. The supplicant wishes to lavish the deity with material and verbal offerings 
when the deity honors his request. Šigaru, “door bolt, lock.” Zanānu, “to poor out, to drip.” 
Here the form is a Š 1cs precative. The causative verb takes the double accusative: “I make

Line 15: Dalīlū, “praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlī ludlul is a cognate accusative con-
struction; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomat-
ically, “let me proclaim the praises.”  
 
   
Line 16: Narbû, “greatness,” is a verbal adjective from the N stem of rabû. The singu-
lar bound form is narbi. Kayyāna, “always, constantly.” Note the antecedent for the 2ms 
pronominal  suffix  on  ilūtu  is  Anu.  The  –ūt  ending  on  the  noun  ilu  is  the  abstract  noun 
marker, creating the meaning “the state of being a god” or “divinity.” Šitammuru (Gtn of 
šamāru), “to praise continually.” 
 
   
is written in Sumerian.

Aside from its structural similarity to biblical prayers of lament like Ps 22, 
perhaps  the  most  obvious  point  of  comparison  with  this  text  and  the  Hebrew 
Bible is the association of the deity with the heavens. In this shuilla Anu is twice 
referred to as il šamê, “god of heaven,” a reference to the deity’s cosmic abode, 
or to its very divine nature. The biblical equivalent occurs as 
 in BH 
and as 
 in biblical Aramaic. Most, if not all, of the twenty-three instanc-
es of this phrase seem to appear in late texts.1  Nonetheless,  the authors of the 
Hebrew Bible apply this epithet to their god, Yahweh. 
 
However, this point of contact leads also to a point of strong contrast. It is 
one  thing  to  be  deemed  the  heavenly  god,  or  to  have  the  heavens  declared  a 
god, as is the case with Anu. It is quite another matter simply to state that the 
heavens constitute one of the abodes of the deity, as is the case with Yahweh. In 
fact, the Hebrew Bible is adamant that the heavens are not divine, but are mere-
ly one of Yahweh’s many creations. Genesis 1:1 proclaims that Elohim “created 
 
1  See Gen  24:3, 7; 2  Chr 36:23; Ezra 1:2;  5:11; 7:12,  21,  23 (x2); Neh 1:2,  4,  5;  2:4, 20; Dan 
2:18, 37, 44; Jonah 1:9. Although the dating of Gen 24:3 and 7 is speculative, J. van Seters has 
made the most cogent argument for dating the Yahwist source to the late exilic period (Abraham 
in  History  and  Tradition  [New  Haven:  Yale,  1975],  148–53).  Another  view  is  that  Gen  24:3,  7 
reflect “an older concept” that is revived in the Persian period (Hutter, 389).

the  heavens  and  the  earth.”  In  Isa  42:5,  Yahweh  is  “the  one  who  created  the 
heavens.”  The  phrase  is  not an  action,  but  an  epithet;  it  serves  to  define  Yah-
weh’s  role  and  power.  Ps  102:25  expresses  the  same  idea  in  more  anthropo-
morphic terms, “the heavens are the work of your hands.” This idea of Yahweh 
as creator of the heavens, not simply a resident of the heavens, is conveyed in 
multiple texts in which Yahweh is said to have created the heavenly bodies, such 
as  the  sun,  moon,  stars,  and  constellations.  Thus,  while  Anu  and  Yahweh  are 
both  gods  of  the  heavens,  the  Hebrew  Bible  repeatedly  distinguishes  Yahweh 
from the heavens. One possible exception is Dan  4:23, 
, “You 
will acknowledge that Heaven is mighty.” In this case, “Heaven” is the subject of 
the  predicate  adjective  “mighty,”  and  represents  the  only  instance  in  which 
“Heaven” is synonymous with the god of Israel.2 However, it may well be that 
“Heaven” is no more deified in this verse than “the White House” is considered 
the President of the United States. Each refers to the location from which ulti-
mate authority of its respective precinct resides. 
 
Although the phrase pāšir ūmi does not have a counterpart in BH, the con-
cept is at the forefront of Job’s distress. During the initial response to his calami-
ty, he cried out 
, “may that day (i.e., the day he was born) be as 
darkness”  (3:4).  If  that  day  had  never  happened,  he  would  not  have  lived  his 
tortuous  existence.  While  not  worded  the  same,  Job’s  desire  is  essentially  the 
same as that of this prayer’s supplicant, namely, may the deity remove all traces 
of  this  arduous  day  from  thought  or  memory.  On  a  separate  note,  the  verb 
pašāru has רתפ as its Hebrew cognate and רשׁפ as its Aramaic cognate. This verb 
is found only in the context of the Joseph Narrative (Gen 40–41) and in Dan 5. 
Always with “dream” as its object, it literally means, “to loosen the dream,” im-
plying  that  there  is  a  trapped  meaning  of  the  dream  that  must  be  released  in 
order for the dream to be interpreted. 
Continuing this theme, dreams in the ancient Near East were powerful forc-
 
es. They were considered channels of divine communication.3 Given the fact that 
deities  could  be  either  beneficent  or  malevolent  depending  on  one’s  piety, 
dreams could elicit a frightening experience. Such is the case, once again, with 
Job. He cries out in protest to Yahweh, “If I say, ‘My bed comforts me and my 
couch bears my complaint,’ then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with 
visions; so that my throat chooses suffocation, and my bones, death” (7:13–15). 
In this light, it is no wonder both the supplicant and Job would wish for dreams 
to be absolved. 
Line 14 reflects the ancient Near Eastern notion that the earthly temple was 
 
a scale model  of the deity’s heavenly residence. A stairway connected the two 
abodes,  with  a  gate  situated  at  the  top  of  the  stairway  at  the  entrance  of  the 
 
2  The idea of a  deified heaven is prevalent in the books of 1  Macc (3:18, 19, 50; 4:24) and 2 
Macc (7:11; 8:20).

cosmic  dwelling.  This  concept  is  most  clearly  reflected  in  the  Tower  of  Babel 
narrative of Gen 11:1–9. It is also reflected in Gen 28:17, in which Jacob, after 
having experienced a terrifying theophany, proclaimed,

,  “Is this  none  other  than  the temple  of  the gods?  Is  this  not  the

gate  of  heaven?”  Jacob  not  only  alludes to  the mythological  concept, but  also 
affirms it by equating the temple with the gate of heaven. This notion is likely at 
work in Ezek 43:4, as well, in which Yahweh’s glory enters the temple by way of 
the gate.

A Shuilla: Ea 1a 

ALAN LENZI 

Ea (Akk.; Sum. Enki) was the god of fresh water, wisdom, and magic. Origi-
nally from the southern city of Eridu (modern Abu Shahrain), Ea was venerated 
throughout Mesopotamia from earliest times into the Hellenistic period. Besides 
his temple at Eridu, Ea had cult installations in Borsippa, Drehem, Kish, Lagash, 
Larsa, Mari, Shuruppak, Umma, and Uruk, among others.  In the first millenni-
um, the imperial capitals of Assyria and Babylon both had prominent cult cen-
ters dedicated to the deity. 

Various traditions make Ea the son of Anu or the son of the goddess Nam-
mu.  His  wife  is  Damgalnuna/Damkina.  His  most  prominent  son  is  Marduk, 
though he is also the father of Adapa and Nanshe, among others. His well-known 
grandson  is  Nabu,  god  of  wisdom  and  scribes.  Ea’s  vizier  is  the  two-faced 
Isimud/Usmu. 

Ea was first and foremost the god of fresh water, the basis of life and agri-
cultural abundance. The ancient city of Eridu was the location of his main tem-
ple,  É-abzu,  “Apsu-house”  (also  called  É-engur-ra,  “House  of  Fresh  Waters”), 
which in ancient times was situated in a marshy area near the coast where the 
Euphrates emptied into the Persian Gulf. This ecological locale may explain his 
watery  association  and  almost  certainly  the  large  amounts  of  fish  bones—
remnants of offerings—that archaeologists have recovered in deep soundings of 
his temple.1 

Mythologically, Ea resided in a subterranean watery place called the Apsû, 
the source of all fresh waters. According to Enūma eliš Tablet I, Apsu (male) and 
Tiamat (female) were originally two primordial bodies of water that mingled to 
create all of the gods. When Ea learned of Apsu’s plot to kill his noisy offspring, 
Ea immobilized Apsu with an incantation,  killed him, and turned him into  his 
divine  abode.  This  mythological  narrative  reflects  what  is  widely  known  from 
other religious and ritual texts: Ea’s incantatory word was powerful and effective 
(see our lines 13, 24, and 26).

Ea  was  widely  known  in  Mesopotamian  tradition  as  a  protective,  benevo-
lent, and caring god to humans. According to several myths, Ea had a hand in 
creating humanity and was always ready to help preserve his creation in the face 
of danger, even when this meant, as in Gilgamesh XI and Atram-ḫasīs, subverting 
the plan of the other gods who had decreed humanity’s destruction. As seen in 
the myths Inana and Enki and Enki and the World Order, Ea was also the origi-
nal holder of the divine powers (Sum. me) that gave shape to the world and or-
ganized  human  civilization.  According  to  another  sparsely  preserved  tradition, 
Ea sent seven antediluvian sages (apkallū) to bring the arts of civilization to hu-
manity;  the most  prominent  of  these  is  Adapa.  These  seven  sages  occasionally 
appear in incantations.2 
 
As god of wisdom and magic, Ea played a prominent role as patron of vari-
ous crafts, including those of everyday artisans as well as those especially asso-
ciated  with intermediation  between  humans  and gods  (i.e.,  exorcism, lamenta-
tion,  divination,  astrology,  and  medicine  in  the  first  millennium).3  A  common 
incantatory phrase used in namburbi-rites, “Ea has done, Ea has undone” (īpuš 
Ea ipšur Ea), reflects Ea’s protective and benevolent character as well as the mag-
ical power of his word.4 

In keeping with his role as god of water, Ea was identified in iconography 
by  streams  of  water  pouring  out  of  his  shoulders.  Sometimes  he  appears  in  a 
structure that is surrounded by water, probably representing the Apsu. In post-
Kassite times, Ea was symbolized by the goat-fish, a turtle, or a curved staff with 
a ram’s head on the end. 

Like  Anu  and  Enlil,  Ea  was  associated  with  one  of  the  three  regions  (or 
“paths,” ḫarrānū) of the sky and the stars therein. Ea’s region was the southern 
most (see page 411 for more on the celestial “paths”). Ea was closely associated 
with the constellation Nūnu, “The Fish” (our Piscis Austrinus). Ea’s divine num-
ber was 40. 

THE PRAYER:  

 
Ea 1a follows the typical tri-partite structure found in many other incanta-
tion-prayers. The prayer begins with a fairly long introductory hymn in lines 1–
13, continues with the supplication section in lines 14–28, and concludes with 
three lines of praise (lines 29–31).

The  long  opening  hymn  may  be  analyzed  as  consisting  of  four  parts  (or 
stanzas)  of  unequal  size.  Lines  1–6  form  the  first  part.  In  each  of  these  lines 
there  are two epithets for  Ea,  each  of  which  celebrates  his  authority,  wisdom, 
and/or  role  as  creator  and  sustainer.  These  latter  two  roles  are  expressed  by 
means  of  participles  in  lines  1a  and  6,  which  grammatically  distinguish  them 
from the other epithets in this first part of the hymn. The very general epithets 
in line 1 are complemented in lines 2–5 by several that localize Ea in his home 
town of Eridu and the cult centers dedicated to him there (É-abzu, É-engur-ra, 
and  É-unir).  Finally,  line  6,  with  its  reference  to  waterways,  prepares  for  the 
second section of the hymn in lines 7–8. This second part utilizes tight grammat-
ical parallelism (see the comments to line 8) and second person verbs to bestow 
praise  upon  the  deity.  Ea’s  natural  sphere  of  influence  (i.e.,  water  and  abun-
dance) comes into  clear focus here. In the third part of the hymn (lines 9–11) 
the hymn  shifts to describe what others think of Ea. Third person verbs domi-
nate  these  lines.  Foreshadowing  the  concluding  praise  of  the  prayer  (see  lines 
29–31), lines 9–10 depict the gods of heaven and the netherworld praising Ea. In 
line 11, the people, sandwiched between the two divine realms, praise Ea for his 
authority  (zikirka  kabta)  and  thereby  prepare  both  for  the  final  section  of  the 
hymn and lines 14–16 in the petitions.5 Lines 12–13 close the hymn with a ref-
erence to Ea’s role as sagacious councilor to the gods (line 12), recalling line 1 
generally, and an affirmation of the life giving power of his authoritative, incan-
tatory word (line 13). This last line of the hymn is the first to associate Ea ex-
plicitly  with  magic.  The  power  here  attributed  to  Ea’s  “incantation  of  life,” 
namely, that it keeps the moribund from death, anticipates the phrase’s appear-
ance later in the petitions (lines 24 and 26) and segues nicely into the supplica-
tion  section  of  the  prayer,  which  is  centered  on  the  supplicant’s  desire  for  a 
healthy, long life (line 17). 
The supplication section of the prayer is dominated by two motifs, effective 
 
speech  (lines  14–20)  and  release  from  witchcraft  (lines  21–28),  each  of  which 
provide a perspective on the over-arching theme of the prayer: life. In lines 14–
20 effective speech is first requested from Ea (14–16). The supplicant wants Ea 
to give the order so that they may be restored, their speech be heard, and they 
achieve favorable things. Line 17 follows with a strong expression of the suppli-
cant’s desire for life. Note the imperative, the last one in the prayer, followed by 
the precative. This line announces the prayer’s central theme at its most general 
level  and  anticipates the  specific requests  of  line  28  (at  the  end  of the  second 
half of the supplication section). Lines 18–19 then turn to the issue of the sup-
plicant’s speech and desire for it to be acceptable to their personal deities and to 
influence the actions of both god and king. The juxtaposition of lines 17 and 18–
19 suggest that “life” is inextricably united to the issue of social acceptance and

standing. The final petition of this first half of the supplication section mentions 
the instruments of speech, mouth and tongue, and requests their intercession. 
 
 The second half of the supplication section is dominated by the supplicant’s 
concern for release from witchcraft. In lines 21–23 the supplicant begins with a 
request  that  any  evil  machinations  not  approach.  In  lines  24–25,  using  similar 
language  as  in  lines  21–23  (lines  22  and  24b  are  identical),  the  supplicant re-
quests that the machinations (that apparently have arrived) depart. Then in lines 
26–27 the supplicant requests the release of the bonds of witchcraft, which im-
plies they actually have the supplicant in their grip. Just as the evil intensifies in 
lines  21–27  so  too  do  the  supplicant’s  appeals  to  authorities  that  can  counter 
them: Ea’s incantation is cited in lines 24 and 26 and Ea’s recruitment of Mar-
duk,  his  son  and  traditional  assistant  in  some  forms  of  incantations  (see  the 
comments), is requested in line 27. The end result for all of these requests comes 
out only in line 28: that the supplicant’s body be free of illness. 
 
The prayer does not conclude with the typical line or two in which the sup-
plicant promises to praise the deity. Rather, it ends with three lines that present 
a unique arrangement of several traditional phrases of praise in which the gods 
are the actors.6  
 
Despite  the  fact  that  there  is  only  a  single  line  of  ritual  instructions  pre-
served  on  one manuscript, Mayer’s  MS  A,  we  know  that  Ea  1a,  as  with  several 
other  shuilla-prayers,  was  incorporated  into  various  ritual complexes  as  a  pre-
scribed  prayer.  For  example, its  incipit  is  cited  in  a  royal investiture ritual,7  a 
universal namburbi handbook (SpBTU II, no. 18, rev. 27),8 and part of Bīt rimki 
(see Zimmern, BBR 26 iii 45).9 
 
6  See Mayer, UFBG, 327–40 for this form of ending generally  and 337  for the unique arrange-
ment of the various elements in Ea 1a specifically. Mayer’s MS F expands the praise to four lines 
by incorporating another traditional phrase (see 446, n.21[1]).

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of 
the prayer on the tablet. It is not a part of the prayer itself. LUGAL = šarru, “king.” Nēmequ, 
“wisdom.” Banû, “to create, to build.” Tašīmtu, “prudence, practical intelligence, discern-
ment.”  One  might  choose  to  translate  the  genitives  in  this  line  adjectivally.  Thus,  e.g., 
“king of wisdom” may be rendered “wise king.” The hymnic introduction begins with epi-
thets befitting the Mesopotamian god of wisdom. 
 
   
Line 2: Massû, “leader, expert,” like many other terms in the hymnic introduction, is 
commonly used to describe rulers and deities (see CAD M/1, 327–28). Ṣīru, “exalted, su-
preme, august.” (W)usmu, “someone or something worthy, suitable,” is another term used 
to describe both gods and kings (see AHw, 1497). Usum is the bound form of the noun. É-
zu-ab,  “House  of  the  Abzu,”  is  the  Sumerian  name  of  Ea’s  temple  in  Eridu,  his  original 
home  town.  The  Abzu  (Sum.;  Akk.  Apsû),  is  Ea’s  residence,  located  in  the  subterranean 
fresh waters (see, e.g., Enūma eliš I 71). 
 
   
Line  3:  dEN.LÍL.BÀN.DA  =  Enlilbanda,  “little  Enlil,”  a  common  epithet  for  Ea.  Hunt, 
after noting three texts that equate Sum. bàn-da with Akk. tašīmtu, translates the epithet as 
“Enlil of expertise,” that is, Ea is the ultimate authority within the sphere of wisdom (30–
32, and n.39). He sees this epithet as connecting line 3 back to the use of tašīmtu in line 1 
(24–25). Itpēšu, “wise, expert,” is an adjective used to describe kings and deities (see CAD 
I/J, 299). Karūbu, “honored one, reverently greeted one.” This word is only attested with 
deities.  
 
   
Line 4:  Uršānu, “hero, warrior” (see AHw, 1434 for other references with kings and 
gods). ERI.DU10 = Eridu, Ea’s home town. The case vowel on uršānu indicates that it is not

bound to Eridu; thus, the toponym is functioning adverbially, indicating the hero’s place of 
origin.  ABGAL (NUN-ME) = apkallu, “sage.” This term is often used of gods (e.g., Ea and 
Marduk) as well as special humans, such as Adapa and the other antediluvian sages (see J. 
C. Greenfield, “Apkallu,” DDD, 72–74). Igigû is a general name for the gods of heaven, in 
contrast to  Anunnakkū, who  are the gods of  the netherworld (see Black and Green, 106; 
Enūma eliš VI 69 gives the Igigû as three hundred in number and the Anunnakkū six hun-
dred; contradicting this, VI 39–44 number both groups as three hundred). 
 
   
Line 5:  EN = bēlu, “lord.” É-engur-ra, “House of Fresh Waters,” is another Sumerian 
name for Ea’s temple in Eridu. Ṣulūlu, “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor of divine 
or  royal  protection  (see  CAD  Ṣ,  243).  É-u6-nir,  the  Sumerian  name  of  Ea’s  ziggurrat  at 
Eridu (U6.NIR is the logogram for Akk. ziqqurratu, “temple tower”). The parallelism between 
bēlu and ṣulūlu in this line mutually illuminates the meanings of these two terms. The epi-
thets here and in the next few lines reflect Ea’s status as the Mesopotamian god of water. 
 
   
Line  6:  Babālu,  “to  carry,  to  bring,”  is a  by-form  of  (w)abālu.  ILLU  (A-KAL)  =  mīlu, 
“high water, flood.” Bringing high waters is a positive thing here, as the next word in the 
genitive chain, ḪÉ.GÁL = ḫegallu, “prosperity, abundance,” and the second half of the line 
explain. Ruššu (D of râšu), “to make rejoice.”  ÍD = nāru, “river.” DIDLI is a plural marker 
like MEŠ. Notice the parallel participles. Does “rejoicing rivers” refer to the sound of faster 
moving water in the river beds (see likewise, Hunt, 36)? 
 
   
Line 7: Tâmtu, “sea, lake, large body of water.” The noun appears here as a fp abso-
lute form (without case ending). Whether there is a grammatical (rather than, e.g., met-
rical) purpose for the absolute form is unclear. Ṣuṣû, “reed thicket.” Reed thickets, espe-
cially  prominent  in  the  marshlands  of  the  south,  teemed  with  animals  and  plants  that 
humans in ancient Mesopotamia could use to their advantage for both food and raw mate-
rials.  Eridu  was  located  near  the  marshes.  Dešû,  “to  let  prosper,  to  provide  someone  or 
something  bountifully  with  something.”  ḪÉ.NUN  =  nuḫšu,  “plenty,  abundance.”  The  text 
continues to praise Ea’s watery beneficence in this line. 
 
   
Line 8: Note the tight grammatical parallelism with line 7: prepositional phrase be-
ginning  with  ina,  a  second  person  verb,  then  the  direct  object.  The  longer  prepositional 
phrase in line 7 is balanced here by a genitive chain for the direct object. Qerbetu, “envi-
rons, meadowland.” Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to create, to produce.” ZI = napištu, “life, subsist-
ence, livelihood.” UN.MEŠ = nišū, “people.” Ea’s beneficial creative activity extends beyond 
the watery areas to include the meadows. Mayer’s MS D identifies the “life” of the people

Line 9: Anu, the sky god, was the high god of the Mesopotamian pantheon but was a 
deus otiosus.  dEN.LÍL = Ellil, god of the wind and another of the high gods, was the active 
head of the pantheon until he was replaced by Marduk, probably in the late second mil-
lennium. Ḫadiš, “joyfully.” Râšu, “to rejoice, to exult.” Rīšū is a 3mp predicative. The ob-
ject of the verb is the cause for rejoicing. 
 
   
Line 10: For the Anunnakkī, see line 4 above. Māḫāzu, “shrine, cult center.” Karābu, 
“to bless, greet (with a blessing).” The Anunnakkī are mentioned, whose place in the neth-
erworld was the extreme opposite of the heavenly abodes of Anu and Ellil. 
 
   
Line 11: KUR = mātu, “land, earth.” Šitmuru (Gt of šamāru), “to praise.” Zikru, “utter-
ance, command.” Kabtu,  “heavy, weighty,  important, honored.” Between heaven (line  9) 
and the netherworld (line 10) are the people. Gods and humans both laud Ea. 
 
   
Line 12: DINGIR.MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” GAL.MEŠ = rabûtu (mp), “great.” Nadānu, “to give.” 
The –md– in the middle of the verb is the result of nasalization (–dd– changes to –md–). 
Milku, “counsel, advice.” As a god of wisdom, Ea is especially suited to counsel the gods. 
(But see the similar line in the prayer to Sin, page 392.) 
 
   
Line 13: In the last line of the opening hymn the prayer invokes the deity’s primary 
name for the first time (see also line 24).  Tû, “incantation, spell.”  TI(.LA) =  balāṭu, “life, 
health” (see also line 17). Lā, “not,” is used here with the durative verb to form a prohibi-
tion (“he shall not die”). Mâtu, “to die.” LÚ.ÚŠ = mītu, literally means “dead,” but it seems 
the  word  sometimes  means  someone  who  is  as  good  as  dead  but has  not  ceased  bodily 
function. Foster  (643)  translates the word with “moribund,” which captures its meaning 
nicely. The effectiveness of Ea’s incantatory word is well-known. See, e.g., Enūma eliš I 62–
63.

Line 14: The prayer turns now to petition, as the two imperatives indicate. Ullû (D of 
elû), “to raise up.” Rēšu, “head.” When a social superior raised a person’s head, it meant 
taking notice of the person’s lowly condition and restoring them to their former status or 
position. Nabû, “to name, to call,” with šumu, “name,” as its object (the nominative case 
ending often occurs where the accusative is expected in SB Akkadian) means “to summon, 
to call a person (to exercise a function), to appoint a person to an office” (see CAD N/1, 
35–37). The supplicant is asking Ea to change their lowly situation, whatever it was. May-
er’s  MS E inserts a two line self-presentation formula, naming a certain Balāṭa-ēreš, and a 
standardized lament at this point in the prayer (see Mayer, UFBG, 50–52, 102–3, and 444, 
n.6[1]).  
 
   
Line 15: Qibītu, “speech, command.” The ending of the first word bears the locative-
adverbial –um, which is the equivalent of ina (see line 16), and a 2ms pronominal suffix. 
(The m of the locative assimilates into the k of the suffix; –mk– becomes –kk–.) Nešmû (N 
of šemû), “to be heard.” Zikru, see line 11. Whether the supplicant is asking that the words 
of  the  prayer  specifically  or  their  words  in  broader  society  generally  be  heard,  the  line 
demonstrates  how  effective  human  speech  is  founded  on  divine  decree  (divine  effective 
speech). As if to underline this point, the verbs in this and the next line have changed from 
imperatives (as in lines 14 and 16) to precatives. 
 
   
Line 16: Qību, “command, pronouncement.” SIG5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f), “favora-
ble, good.” Kašādu, “to accomplish, to reach, to achieve.” Ana often accompanies kašādu, 
indicating what or where one is reaching or achieving. The results of effective speech are 
also requested: favorable things. 
 
ina qībīka ana damiqti lukšud 
   
Line 17: Šarāku, “to give, to grant, to bestow.” TI.LA, see line 13. Bâru, “to stay firm, 
to remain in good health.” A variant, lul-bur, in MS E may derive the verb from labāru, “to 
be(come) old.” But we would expect lul-bir, if that were the case. Perhaps we should read 
MS E as lu!-bur or lu5
?-bur here (see Seux, 277, n.20). Ana dāri, “forever and ever,” should 
not be taken too literally. The supplicant is not asking for immortality; rather, they want to 
live a very, very long time. With this petition, the supplicant reaches the very root of their 
desire: life.

Line 18: Atmû, “speech, manner of speaking.” UGU = eli. d15 = ištaru, “goddess.” Ṭâbu 
eli X, “to be  pleasing, to be good to someone.” If Ebeling’s copy of  MS A [= KAR 59] is 
accurate, the above suggested restoration is better than Mayer’s LUGAL; see likewise Foster, 
643 and Seux, 277, n.22. Mayer’s MS E contains a variant: ilū u šarru, “gods and king,” for 
which see line 19. The prayer returns to the theme of effective speech (see line 15), but 
now lays emphasis on the supplicant’s personal deities. They wish the deities to be pleased 
with what they say. 
 
    
Line  19:  Qabêya  is  a  G  inf.  with  a  1cs  pronominal  suffix.  Epēšu,  “to  do,  to  make.” 
Again the text brings up effective speech but now in terms of action rather than just recep-
tion (as in line 18). The supplicant explicitly requests that both god and king do whatever 
they say.  
 
   
Line  20:  Pû,  “mouth.”  Lišānu,  “tongue.”  Pû  u  lišānu  are  metonyms  for  intercessory 
speech or prayer (see CAD L, 211). Šutēmuqu (Št of emēqu), “to pray, to supplicate” (see 
CAD Š/3, 400–401). The dative 1cs suffix on the verb indicates the beneficiary of the in-
tercession: the supplicant.  
 
pû u lišānu lištēmiqūni 
   
Line 21: What I have arranged as a single line here is actually composed of parts of 
the previous and following lines (according to  MS A) in Mayer’s edition. The first half of 
our line is uncertain, though a vetitive, paralleling the second half, seems quite likely and 
a  verb  from  qerēbu  plausible  (see  Seux,  277,  n.25).  KUR=  kašādu,  see  line  16.  The  line 
supplies the verbs for the following two lines that describe what the supplicant wants to 
stay away. 
 
   
Line 22: Mimma, “anything, everything.” Lemnu, “evil, bad, unfavorable.” NU  DÙG.GA 
= lā ṭābu, “not good, hostile, unfavorable.” The supplicant first makes a broad statement 
concerning undesirable things generally before turning to a more specific problem in line 
23.

Line 23: Šunu, means “them,” but is probably best taken as emphasizing the following 
word. Upīšu, “magical procedure,” usually occurs in the plural (just as šunu would lead us 
to expect). But here it lacks the mp ending –ū; thus, it is a singular bound form. The word 
governs the following two paired genitives. Kaššāpu, “warlock.” Kaššaptu, “witch.” As hap-
pens frequently in prayers, the machinations of the anti-social (black) magic of the witch 
and warlock are introduced. In this case, they seem to be the main reason for the suppli-
cant’s  problems.  Mayer’s  MS  F  further  defines  the  upīšū  of  the  witch  and  warlock  as 
kišpīšunu  ruḫêšunu  rusêšunu,  “their witchcraft,  black  magic,  and sorcery.” These three se-
mantically-related terms occur together rather frequently in witchcraft contexts. 
 
   
Line 24: Tû, see line 13. TIN = balāṭu, “life, health.” The line reprises the invocation 
used in line 13 (absent in Mayer’s MS F). This line reiterates its concern for the general evil 
mentioned in line 22. The main verb of the sentence occurs in the next line of the text.  
 
   
Line 25: Nêʾu, means “to turn back.” Irtu (pl. irātu), “breast, chest,” bears a 3mp pro-
nominal  suffix  (lacking  the  final  vowel).  The  consonant  cluster  –tš–  becomes  –ss–.  The 
idiom irta nêʾu means “to turn back, to depart, to withdraw.” Although the supplicant has 
already requested that nothing unfavorable reach them, they request now that Ea use his 
incantatory speech to deflect the evil. 
 
   
Line 26: Riksu, “binding, knot, bond,” here refers to the evil actions of the warlock 
and  witch.  Puṭṭuru  (D  of  paṭāru),  “to  loosen,  to  undo  a  knot.”  Šiptu,  “incantation,  ritual 
wording.”  The  “incantation  of  Eridu”  stands  for  Ea.  Again  the  supplicant appeals  to  the 
effective word of Ea. The power of the supplicant’s enemies seems to be growing stronger. 
First the supplicant wished that nothing evil would approach (21–23). Then the supplicant 
requested that any and all evil be turned back (lines 24–25). Now it seems the evil powers 
of the warlock and witch have a hold on the supplicant and they need to be undone. 
 
   
Line  27:  ḪUL.MEŠ  =  lemnūtu,  “evil  things”  (mp).  For  ABGAL,  see  line  4.  Drawing  on 
previous lines, the supplicant now requests that Ea use Marduk, his son, to help the suppli-
cant get free of the magical machinations of the witch and warlock. This may allude to a 
common motif in Sumerian incantations in which Ea and Marduk cooperate explicitly to 
fight the problem addressed in the incantation (see Adam Falkenstein, Die Haupttypen der

Line 28: Ebēbu, “to be(come) pure, bright,” but here “to be(come) clear (of illness).” 
Minâtu, the plural of minītu, “limbs, body,” is often used in parallel to mešrêtu, “limbs” (see 
CAD M/2, 88). Ṭâbu eli X here (as opposed to its meaning in line 18) means “to be in good 
condition, to be sound, to be healthy.” A first person reference is finally mentioned explic-
itly again, absent in the prayer since line 21. 
 
   
Line  29:  AN  =  šamû,  “the  heavens.”  Ḫadû,  “to  be  joyful.”  The  object  supplies  the 
cause for joy. Râšu, “to rejoice.” See line 9 where Anu rejoices, using very similar words. 
The parallel use of the heavens and the Apsû creates a merism: the entire universe is en-
couraged to give praise to Ea for his beneficence to the supplicant. This line begins a cre-
scendo  of  cosmic  praise  that  concludes  the  prayer,  replacing  the  otherwise  ubiquitous 
personal promise of praise: dalīlīka ludlul, “let me resound your praises.” 
 
   
Line 30: Etelliš, “as a lord, in a lordly fashion.” The first sign of the word is uncertain. 
Šūlulu (Š of alālu), “to celebrate, to laud.” The population of the heavens and the nether-
world (see line 29) are now drawn in to praise Ea. How etelliš functions in the sentence is 
unclear.  Does it  describe the  great  gods  (“in a  lordly fashion  they  laud  you”)  or does  it 
further define the praise the great gods offer to Ea (“they laud you as a lord”)? The word is 
almost always attested with verbs that deal with the body in motion or repose (standing, 
going, entering, or sitting) and is most often attested with alāku (see CAD E, 380–81). Our 
instance would seem to be the exception. The adjectival use of the cognate etellu as a de-
scription of speech (CAD E, 382), however, suggests a basis for understanding the use of 
the adverb here with a speech-related verb. Moreover, in every instance of etelliš the word 
modifies the subject’s action, designated  by the  verb. It seems  most likely therefore that 
the adverb is to be attached to the great gods’ activity of praise here. Mayer’s  MS E con-
cludes the line with ilū rabûti libbaka liṭibbū, “may the great gods please your heart,” and 
his MS F offers ilū ša kiššat likrubū-KI! (for –ka) ilū rabûti libbaka liṭib-ŠU! (for –bū), “may the 
gods of the totality bless you, may the great gods please your heart.” 
 
   
Line 31: Dumqu, “good fortune.” The crescendo of praise grows more specific, naming 
here the Igigî gods, for which see line 4 above, as representatives of the great gods in line 
30.

Line 32: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the 
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is 
directed. As is  typical, the rubric is written in  Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the 
wording of a lifted-hand to Enlilbanda,” i.e., Ea. One MS of the text indicates the prayer is 
directed  at  den-ki,  the  Sumerian  name  for  Ea.  Another  MS  shows  that  it  was  directed  to 
damar-utu,  Marduk.  Unfortunately,  this  latter  MS  does  not  preserve  anything  before  our 
line 25, so we cannot ascertain how the text was adjusted to fit Marduk.  
   
Line 33: The ritual instructions comprise a single line, preserved in only one MS. The 
instructions begin without any indicator (such as DÙ.DÙ.BI = epuštašu, “its ritual,” which is 
used very frequently). The phrase we have here in line 33 is quite stereotypical and com-
monly  attached  to  shuillas.  It  probably  serves  only  as  the  catchphrase  to  a  fuller  ritual, 
which  the  exorcist  would  recall and  perform  probably  from memory  (see  Mayer,  UFBG, 
119, n.3). Lū  .  .  .  lū, “either . .  . or.”  KEŠDA  = riksu, “ritual arrangement, assemblage  of 
offerings” (compare the usage here to those in lines 26 and 27 above). NÍG.NA =  nignakku, 
“incense burner.” DÙ = epēšu, “to do, to make.”

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

Although our prayer  offers several interesting possibilities for comparative 
purposes,  we  focus  here  on  two:  the  “hand-lifting”  gesture  accompanied  by  a 
formal address found in all shuilla-prayers and the BH equivalents to the suppli-
cant’s first petitions in line 14. 

Lines  1–12  of  our  prayer  to  Ea  comprise  a  lengthy  hymnic  introduction, 
which is of course a typical feature of shuilla-prayers. As discussed in the gen-
eral  introduction,  the  hand-lifting  gesture  along  with  its  verbal  component  of 
honored address was a complex formal gesture of greeting in ancient Mesopota-
mia based on a master-servant relationship. When used with prayer, the complex 
of gesture and formal address (i.e., hymnic introduction) “emphasized the com-
municative  gesture  .  .  .  ,  a  salutation  signaling  recognition  of  a  reciprocal but 
asymmetrical relationship between client and deity” (see page 35 of the general 
introduction). Do we find a similar adaptation of such a greeting in the prayers 
of  the  Hebrew  Bible?  Although  the  Bible  does  not  show  evidence  of  a  special 
kind of “lifted-hand” ritual-prayer, the Hebrew Bible does preserve attestations 
in  its  prayers  of  the  hand  raising  gesture  and  the  formal  mode  of  address  (of 
varying  lengths)  similar  to  the  shuilla’s  hymnic  introduction.  In  light  of  the 
comparative evidence, these texts display another facet of ancient Israel’s mas-
ter-servant model of divine-human relations. 

Formal  address  dominated  by  praise  is  found  at  the  beginning  of  several 
biblical prayers in which individuals or a representative group pray on behalf of 
the community. Note, for example, the brief hymnic introduction to a penitential 

 

ӎ⼯⼯⼯ A SHUILLA: EA 1A 

239

prayer in Dan 9:4 and the longer ones to communal laments in Pss 44:2–9 and 
89:2–19.  Nehemiah  9,  a  penitential  prayer  like  Dan  9,  in  which  Levites  stand 
before the community and petition Yahweh to forgive the people’s sin, is a par-
ticularly interesting example. The prayer begins in v. 5b and ends in v. 37; the 
introductory  hymn  occupies vv.  5b–32a!  At  the  start  of the  prayer the  Levites 
address  Yahweh  in  a  manner  that  recalls  the  significance  of  Akkadian  karābu 
(BH cognate:  כרב)1 to the hand-raising greeting (see page 35 of the general in-
troduction): וּני ֵה ֱא ה ָוֹהְי  ָתּ ַא וּר ָבּ, “You are blessed, O Yahweh, our god” (v. 5b).2 
The hymn then goes on to praise Yahweh’s name, uniqueness, creative and sus-
taining power, and especially his historical dealings with Israel, from the exodus 
to the speaker’s present day. This long account of the history between Yahweh 
and  Israel  also  brings  out  Yahweh’s  character:  his  compassion,  long-suffering, 
forgiveness, and willingness to discipline his people rather than to forsake them. 
The entire hymn is prelude to the relatively brief petition in vv. 32b–37.  

Although we see the formal address in this long opening hymn, we of course 
do  not  see  the  hand  raising  gesture.  The  opening  statement  about  Yahweh’s 
blessedness,  however,  may  be  enough  to  suggest  hand-raising  lies  in  the  pre-
sumed background for both the author and their early readers. This is a plausi-
ble  presumption  in light  of passages like  Ps  134:1–2,  “Bless  Yahweh,  all  (you) 
servants  of  Yahweh  .  .  .  lift  up  your  hands  .  .  .  bless  Yahweh!”  (ה ָוֹה ְי־ת ֶא  וּכ ֲר ָבּ 
ה ָוֹהְי־ת ֶא וּכ ֲר ָבוּ . . . ם ֶכ ֵד ְי־וּא ְשׂ . . . ה ָוֹהְי י ֵד ְב ַ־ל ָכּ), and Ps 63:5, “I bless you . . . I lift up 
my hands” (י ָפּ ַכ א ָשּׂ ֶא . . .  ְכ ֶר ֲב ַא).3 As these texts suggest, the hand-raising gesture 
is closely aligned with offering blessing (or praise) to the deity. It is also associ-
ated with petitionary prayer in other passages. Note, for example, how Ezra lifts 
his  hands  in prayer (י ַפּ ַכ  ה ָשׂ ְר ְפ ֶא) in Ezra 9:5, a third penitential prayer (though 
this prayer lacks a hymnic introduction). Solomon does the same in 1 Kgs 8:22 
(
), where introductory praise accompanies the gesture (vv. 23–24) and 
 
וי ָפּ ַכּ
precedes the petition (vv. 25ff. ).4 

שֹׂר ְפ ִיּ ַו

If our comparative material is at all instructive, we should look at each of 
these biblical contexts in similar terms as the audience model described for the 
Mesopotamian  shuilla-prayer:  a  supplicant  reaches  out  to  a  social  superior  for 
 
1  Tawil, ALCBH, 58. 
2  This reading, which assumes continuity between vv. 5 and 6, requires a slight emendation to 
the  MT, which  reads:  ם ֶכי ֵה ֱא  ה ָוֹה ְי־ת ֶא  וּכ ֲר ָב, “Bless Yahweh, your god.” See H.  G. M. Williamson, 
Ezra, Nehemiah (WBC 16; Waco: Word, 1985), 303–4. For a different understanding, see Joseph 
Blenkinsopp, Ezra-Nehemiah: A Commentary (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1988), 296, 
301. 
3  Note the related issue of lifting hands as part of conferring a blessing on people in, e.g., 1 Kgs 
8:54 and Lev 9:22. 
4  See also, e.g., Exod 9:29, 33, 1 Kgs 8:38, and Ps 28:2 (י ַדָי י ִא ְשׂ ָנ ְבּ) for the gesture in a context of 
supplication. The hand-raising gesture is also reflected farther afield in 1 Tim 2:8. For a fuller 
discussion  of  the  various  phrases in  Biblical  Hebrew  that  denote the  hand-raising  gesture  and 
reflection about how each relates specifically to praise and/or supplication, see Mayer I. Gruber, 
Aspects  of  Nonverbal  Communication  in  the  Ancient  Near  East  (Studia  Pohl  12/1;  Rome:  Biblical 
Institute Press, 1980), 25–44.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

help, greeting the one petitioned via a conventional gesture and formal address 
that recognizes the superior’s higher position in relation to the supplicant. In this 
manner, the supplicant hopes to establish a favorable relationship with the one 
petitioned and thereby obtain a positive answer to their request. It is interesting 
that we do not see the hand-lifting gesture or lengthy formal address in either 
the dingirshadibba-prayers to personal gods or biblical laments of the individual. 
For reflections on this latter point, see page 442. 
 
In the prayer’s first line of petitions (line 14) the supplicant says, “raise my 
head, call (my) name!” (ulli rēšīya ibi šumu). These two idioms have equivalents 
in BH. Before we make any comparisons, however, we should recognize that “to 
raise the head” and “to call a name” have more than one meaning in both Akka-
dian and BH (see CAD N/2, 107–8 and HALOT, 1164–65 for the former and CAD 
N/1, 33–37 and HALOT, 1129 for the latter). The sense of rēša ullû in our Akka-
dian prayer is something like “to take notice with favorable intention.” The same 
sense  for the BH cognate phrase  שׁאֹ ר  אשׂנ occurs in 2 Kgs 25:27  („ Jer 52:31), 
where  Jehoichan  is  shown  mercy  by  the  Babylonian  king  Evil-merodach,  and 
Gen 40:13, where Joseph informs the Pharaoh’s chief cupbearer that the Phar-
aoh  will  restore  him  to  his  former  position.5  Šuma  nabû  in  our prayer  has  the 
sense of summoning or appointing a person for a particular position or standing. 
The  same  meaning  is  found  in  the  BH  idiom  ם ֵשׁ ְבּ  ארק.  See,  for  example,  Exod 
31:2, 35:30, Josh 21:9 (where it is used as a means to allocate land; see also 1 
Chron 6:50), Isa 40:26, 43:1, 45:3, 4, and Isa 49:1, where the idiom is broken up 
across  the  line’s  poetic  parallelism.  These  idioms  demonstrate  once  again  the 
significant  cultural  (including  religious)  continuity  between  ancient  Israel  and 
ancient Mesopotamia despite their many differences. 
 
5  Note, however, that the idiom “to raise the head” is also used later in the narrative (Gen 40:19, 
31)  in  other  senses,  rather  literally,  as  in  “the  Pharaoh  will  raise  your  head  from  upon  you” 
(י ֶל ָ ֵמ; v. 19), and in the idiomatic sense, “to summon” (v. 31).

GULA:  

ӎӛ 

A Shuilla: Gula 1a 

ALAN LENZI 

Gula was a mother goddess from the Babylonian city of Isin and one of the 
high gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon. According to various traditions Gula 
was  the  daughter  of  An  and  Urash,  the  wife  of  Ninurta  or  Pabilsag,  and  the 
mother of Damu and Ninazu. Gula is attested already in third millennium texts 
(perhaps  as  early  as  the  ED  period  in  Fara)  and  persists  in  the  Mesopotamian 
pantheon until Hellenistic times. By the OB period Gula had already been identi-
fied  with  and  worshipped  as  the  goddesses  Ninisina,  Nintinugga,  Ninkarrak, 
Gunura, and Baba, among others. As the azugallatu, “the chief physician,” Gula 
was closely associated with healing and the patron deity of the asû, “physician.” 
She  was  also  the patron  god of  dogs  and  associated  with the  dog  in  iconogra-
phy.1 Given her power over disease, Gula was sometimes invoked in curse for-
mulae to bring illness upon transgressors (see, e.g., SAA 2, no. 6, §52).  

Gula’s  main  temple,  É-gal-maḫ,  “the  exalted  palace,”  was  in  Isin,  but  she 
had temples and shrines—sometimes more than one—in many other cities (e.g., 
Ashur, Babylon, Borsippa, Nippur, Lagash, Larsa, Umma, Ur, and Uruk). Excava-
tions  at  cultic  sites  in  Isin,  Nippur,  and  Sippar  have  revealed  dog  and  human 
figurines as well as models of body parts.2 Some of the dog figurines seem to be 
apotropaic or petitionary in nature, but others were clearly placed as thanksgiv-
ing votives to Gula for help received.3 The human figurines probably represent 
individuals. The varied hand placement of these figurines upon their body may 
have been intended to indicate the part of the sufferer’s body that was afflicted. 
The temples of Gula were also a center for storing and copying texts associated 
with the healing professions. Tablets have been found in her temple at Isin, and 
colophons mention tablets being  copied from an original stored at a  temple of 
Gula (see, e.g., Hunger, BAK, nos. 199[d], 203[k], 380). 
 
1  Gula’s  temple  is  called  the  É-ur-gi7-ra,  “the  dog  house,”  in  some  texts,  and  thirty-three  dog 
burials were uncovered near Gula’s temple in Isin. See Avalos, 210–12 and references there.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Gula’s  star  was  Lyra  and  her  canine  representation  is  associated  with  our 
constellation Hercules. One of the most important first-millennium texts associ-
ated  with  the  goddess  is  a  two-hundred-line  hymn  that  alternates  between  a 
description of Gula and her spouse, Ninurta.4  

THE PRAYER:  

The  prayer  may  be  divided  into  three  sections:  the  introduction  (lines  1–

10), the petition section (lines 11–24), and the promise of praise (line 25).  

Lines 1–10 form the introductory section of the prayer. An invocation and a 
mere  three  epithets  (line  1)  lead  directly  into  what  Mayer  calls  the  “turning” 
(Hinwendung;  see  UFBG,  122–49)  in  lines  2–3.  Here  the  supplicant  explicitly 
seeks the goddess’s attention with first person verbs and demands (note the im-
peratives) that she be present and listen to the prayer. The supplicant gives rea-
sons for turning to Gula in lines 4–6. Since all of these reasons concern the func-
tional domain of the goddess (and recall hymnic epithets found elsewhere), we 
may also consider these lines a kind of implicit praise of the goddess, continuing 
what the prayer started in line 1. Lines 7–8 reprise the invocation and praise of 
the goddess with three epithets, repeating or paralleling line 1. These lines lead 
into lines 9–10, where the supplicant turns to the deity again, using first person 
verbs,  and  demands  her  attention,  using  imperatives  (compare  lines  2–3).  The 
mixture of invocation, hymnic elements, and explicit requests for the goddess’s 
attention prepares the way for the petition section of the prayer in lines 11–24. 
The petition section can be divided into three parts, lines 11–19, which con-
cern the angry personal and city deities; lines 20–22, which deal with Marduk; 
and lines 23–24, which make a final general plea. The supplicant begins in lines 
11–12 by wishing to send Gula to intervene on their behalf with their angry per-
sonal  and  city  deities  (the  lušpurka  formula;  see  UFBG,  236–39).  Although  the 
problem  of  angry  deities  is  worked  into  this  first  petition  proper  rather  than 
stated as an independent complaint, its ramifications are clearly expressed in the 
complaint that follows in lines 13–14: the supplicant is afraid due to evil oracles 
and dreams. Having expressed a desire to send Gula, the supplicant now spells 
out in lines 15–19 exactly what they want her to do. By the power of her divine 
word,  the  supplicant  requests  that  she  restore  their  troubled  relationship  with 
their protective deities. As if to emphasize its importance, the supplicant prefac-
es this second petition proper with another reprised invocation in line  15  (see 
line 1 and compare line 7). The same invocation is repeated in line 20, the open-
ing of the second part of the prayer’s petition section.  

In a  somewhat surprising turn  of events, the supplicant now  requests  that 
Gula also intercede with Marduk (line 21–22a) and put in a good word on the 
supplicant’s  behalf  (line  22b).  The  precise  reason  for  this  second  intercessory 
 
4  See W. G. Lambert, “The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi,” Or n.s. 36 (1967), 105–32  and plates 
VIII–XXIII.

petition is unclear, but Gula’s role as an intermediary goddess is attested else-
where. One could imagine the cooperation between the human asû, “physician,” 
and āšipu, “exoricist,” suggested the cooperation between Gula, patron of physi-
cians, and Marduk, a god closely associated with magic.5 In any case, the com-
parison of Gula to a personal god in line 3 has foreshadowed her intermediary 
role here.  

The petition section ends with one final, general petition for Gula to protect, 
forgive, and provide well-being  for the  supplicant. This last petition leads  into 
the promise of praise in line 25.  

Two  major  elements  in  the  prayer  give  its  text  a  sense  of  unity.  The  first 
among these is the repeated invocation in structurally significant locations, lines 
1, 15, and 20.6 The latter two instances introduce a part of the prayer in which 
the supplicant asks Gula to intercede with another divine power on their behalf. 
The repetition of the invocation in these places maintains the prayer’s focus on 
Gula,  even  while  Gula’s  attention  is  directed  elsewhere.  Another  unifying  ele-
ment is the thematic prevalence of mercy and intercession. This is most obvious-
ly manifested in the repetition of the word rēmēnītû/rēmēnû, “merciful,” in lines 
1, 7, and 21. But one can also see the theme in the “hem of the garment” image-
ry of line 3, the string of infinitives in lines 5–6 (bulluṭu, šullumu, eṭēru, gamālu, 
and šūzubu),7 and the two-fold use of the idiom abbūta ṣabātu, “to intercede,” in 
lines 20 (as an epithet for the goddess) and 22 (as an imperative).  

Although the prayer is directed to Gula in the majority of MSS, three of May-
er’s MSS (B, E, and H) direct the prayer to a different goddess, Belet-ili (Bēlet-ilī). 
These  same  three  MSS  also  preserve  an  attalû  formula  within  the  prayer’s  text, 
though at different places in each. These variations in addressee and the content 
demonstrate once again how shuilla-prayers could be adapted for various ritual 
purposes. In addition to this, recent work on Bīt salāʾ mê has placed our prayer 
in the ninth section of that ritual series among a number of other shuilla-prayers 
(see Ambos). 
 
5  For the intermediary role of Gula, see Avalos, 187–91, who mentions the parallel between the 
cooperation of human ritual officials and that of the gods. 
6  See also line 7 in Mayer’s MSS A and G. 
7  Note the use in line  24,  near  the  end of the prayer, of nouns  cognate to two  of these verbs 
(gimillu, “requital,” cognate to gamālu and balāṭu, “life,” cognate to bulluṭu).

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” This word marks the beginning of the prayer. It is 
not a part of the prayer itself. Three MSS (Mayer’s B, E, and H) direct this same prayer to 
the  goddess  Belet-ili  simply  by  substituting  her  name  for  Gula’s.  GAŠAN  =    bēltu,  “lady” 
(but  also  šarratu,  “queen”).  Šurbūtu  (fs),  šurbû  (m),  “exalted,  supreme,”  is  often  used  to 
describe deities and their epithets (see CAD Š/3, 341–42). The Š stem verbal adjective is 
used here as an elative (i.e., superlative), “most exalted.” The form is not to be confused 
with the infrequently occurring noun šurbûtu, “greatness, exaltedness.” The TUM sign may 
also be  read as  tu4,  indicating SB Akkadian’s loss of mimation.  AMA  =  ummu,  “mother.” 
Rēmēnītû (f), rēmēnû (m), “merciful,” is also frequently used to describe deities and their 
epithets (see CAD R, 238). Compare this epithet to Marduk’s on page 296. (W)ašābu, “to 
dwell,  to sit.”  The  participle is  functioning  substantively,  in  apposition  to the  other epi-
thets in the line. AN = šamû, “heavens,” is always plural. KÙ = ellu, “pure, clear.”  
 
   
Line  2:  šasû,  “to  call  out  to,  to  shout.”  The  G  preterite  form  of  the  verb,  išsi  (3cs), 
often becomes  ilsi in  later Akkadian.  Alsi is a 1cs preterite.  MU = 1cs  pronominal suffix. 
Izuzzu, “to stand.” The suffixed –m on the verb is the ventive morpheme. Šemû, “to hear, to 
listen to.” Yâti, “to me.” The supplicant interrupts the string of epithets to request Gula’s 
attention  directly  with  performative  verbs,  the  speaking  of  which  executes  their  ritual 
actions (i.e., “I hereby call to you”). The imperatives demand Gula’s presence and atten-
tion.  This  and  the  following  line  illustrate  a  common  rhetorical  move  in  Mesopotamian 
prayers.

Line 3: šeʾû, “to seek out.” Saḫāru, “to turn.” GIM = kīma, “like, as.” TÚG.SÍG = sissik-
tu, “fringe, hem.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.” d15 = ištaru, “goddess.” Ṣabātu, “to seize.” The pray-
er builds on alsīki in line 2 with another three 1cs performative verbs. The last verb must 
be understood metaphorically, unless we are to imagine the supplicant standing before the 
divine image. Seizing the hem of a social superior’s garment was a symbolic gesture, in the 
present case, of supplication (see CAD Ṣ, 18 and the discussion of the gesture on page 426, 
line 15). 
 
   
Line 4: Aššum, “because.” Dīnu, “(legal) case,” is the object of the infinitive (despite 
the written case vowel).  Dânu (diānum), “to  judge.”  EŠ.BAR  = purussû, “(legal) decision.” 
Parāsu, “to cut, to decide.” Both phrases in the line are cognate accusative constructions 
(i.e., the verb and its object derive from the same root), creating a rhythmic and allitera-
tive line. Render both phrases idiomatically. The supplicant lays out in lines 4–6 the spe-
cific reasons for turning to Gula, a god who has the power to judge. Although these lines 
provide  supporting  evidence  for  the  supplicant’s  turning,  they  use  verbs  that  appear  in 
various hymnic epithets. They therefore should also be considered implicit praise for the 
deity. 
 
   
Line  5:  Bulluṭu  (D  of  balāṭu),  “to  heal,  to  revive,  to  spare,  to  provide  support  for.” 
Šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to keep well, to heal.” The infinitives are functioning as gerunds. 
Bašû, “to be, to exist.” Itti, “with.” How would one translate “they are with you” idiomati-
cally? The supplicant has turned to Gula because she also has the power to heal and re-
store people to health. 
 
   
Line 6: Eṭēru, “to save, to take away.” Gamālu, “to do a favor, to spare,” but see also 
page 328. Šūzubu (Š of ezēbu), “to make someone leave, to rescue.” Idû, “to know.” Gula’s 
knowledge described in this line is not abstract or theoretical; rather, it is functional. She 
knows how to deploy actions that save, spare, and rescue people.

Line  7:  The  supplicant  repeats  the  invocation,  nearly  repeating the  first  half  of  the 
opening  line.  Šaqūtu  (fs),  šaqû  (m),  “elevated,  prominent,  sublime,”  is  often  used  to  de-
scribe deities and their qualities (see CAD Š/2, 17–19). It is a near synonym of the adjec-

tive it replaces from line 1, šurbūtu. Note, however, that Mayer’s MSS A and G in this line 
actually read šurbūtu; there is no replacement in these MSS. 
 
   
Line  8:  Maʾdû  (maʾdûti,  mp),  “large  quantity,  abundance.”  MUL.MEŠ  =  kakkabū, 
“stars.” Šamāmū, “heavens,” is a poetical equivalent of šamû. The reprised invocation con-
tinues, providing a semantic parallel to the second half of line 1. “Among the myriad stars 
of heaven” is a way of describing Gula in the heavenly realm as she exists among her di-
vine peers. (Deities were associated with stars.) 
 

Gula bēltu šaqūtu ummu rēmēnītû 

ina maʾdûti kakkabī šamāmī 

bēltu kâši asḫurki ibšâki uznāya 

Line 9: Kâši, “to you,” is redundant (perhaps emphatic) since the verb that follows it 
 
(saḫāru,  see  line  3)  also  has a  2fs  dative  pronominal  suffix.  GEŠTU.II  =  uznā,  “ears”  (d). 
When used with ears or eyes, bašû means “to be fixed on, to be attentive to” (see CDA, 40). 
Mayer’s  MS  H  (from  Sippar)  includes  8  very  formulaic  lines  here  (including  a  self-
presentation  formula,  the  attalû-formula  [see  UFBG,  100],  and  a  formulaic  lament  and 
petition) in which Shamash-shum-ukin laments (as king, with Marduk and Zarpanitu as his 
personal deities) on account of an evil eclipse (see UFBG, 452, n.79(4)). 
 
   
Line  10:  ZÌ.MAD.GÁ  =  maṣḫatu,  “(a  kind  of)  flour.”  Maḫāru,  “to  accept,  to  receive.” 
Leqû, “to take, to accept.” Unnīnu, “prayer, supplication.” The verb muḫrīnni has two ob-
jects, the one marked by the 1cs pronominal suffix and the word maṣḫata, “flour.” The two 
objects should be understood as in apposition (thus, to receive the flour is to receive the 
supplicant)  and  rendered  in  an  idiomatic  manner.  The  line  contains  a  couple  of  stock 
phrases in which the supplicant asks Gula to accept both the offering and the prayer. The 
two imperatives in this line hark back to the two in line 2. The imperatives in line 10 pro-
vide  the  next  step  in  the  logical  progression  begun  with  the  earlier  imperatives:  “stand 
here and listen to me” (line 2) and “receive my flour offering, accept my prayer” (line 10). 
One could even suggest that the actions of each imperative are collated via their position 
in their respective lines, with the first ones showing movement from one to the other and 
likewise the second ones: “stand here, receive my flour offering” (2a, 10a); “listen to me, 
accept my prayer” (2b, 10b). Together these requests form a ritual prelude for the personal 
and therefore more important petitions (from the supplicant’s perspective) that follow in 
the next several lines. 
 
   
Line 11: Šapāru, “to send.” Zenû (m), zenītu (f), “angry.” The supplicant wants to send 
Gula to their personal deities to intercede on their behalf. For a discussion of the personal 
god in Mesopotamia, see page 431.

Line 12: URU = ālu, “city.” The words šabsu and kamlu are predicative constructions  
in a subordinate clause (note the ša). When the subjunctive –u is added to the 3ms predica-
tive forms (šabis and kamil), the short  i-vowels reduce.  Both words mean “is angry.” Be-
sides the personal gods, the supplicant also wishes to send Gula to the city god. Mayer’s MS 
E includes a fragmentary attalû–formula after this line (see UFBG, 453, n.82(5)). 
 
   
Line 13:  Ina here means “as a  result of,  on account of.” Bīru, “the answer  received 
through  divination,  an  oracle.”  Šuttu,  “dream.”  Given  the  following  verb,  both  singular 
nouns  are  probably  to  be  understood  as  collectives.  Itaškunu  (Ntn  of  šakānu),  “to  occur, 
arise  continually”  (said  of  signs);  see  CAD  B,  265  for  a  near  parallel.  The  verb  is  in  an 
unmarked relative clause (i.e., there is no ša) and does not take a subjunctive ending (–u) 
due to the presence of the ventive –am. The text begins a new sentence in line 13, which 
gives the reasons for the states of mind described in line 14. Mayer’s MS E includes a one 
line  self-presentation  formula  and  a  truncated  attalû-formula  here  (see  UFBG,  453, 
n.83(4)); both formulae are similar to what MS H adds after line 9, only they are shorter 
here and use generic name and date “placeholders” (NENNI). 
 
   
Line 14: Palāḫu, “to fear, to be afraid.” There are two homonymic roots in Akkadian 
that  have  closely  related  meanings,  adāru  A  or  I  and  B  or  II  (according  to  the  CAD  or 
CDA). The first means “to be dark, to be worried.” The second means “to be afraid.” De-
termining  which  root  is  used  in  a  specific  context  is  difficult  sometimes  (see  CAD  A/1, 
107–8  and  109).  Despite  the  CAD  listing  our  line  under  adāru  B,  its  own  criteria  (A/1, 
107–8)  would  suggest  adāru  A  for  our  case,  in  which  psychological  trauma  rather  than 
religious awe is paramount. The form of the verb is a Gtn, “to be anxious, worried con-
stantly.”  The  doubled  second  letter  of  the  root  (–dd–)  is  nasalized  in  our  example,  thus 
atanamdaru.  The final  –u is superfluous,  perhaps inserted  under the influence of the  1cs 
predicative ending of the first verb in the line. A subjunctive is not called for. 
 
   
Line 15: The first part of the line recalls the opening of line 1 in another reprise of the 
initial  invocation  (see also line 7). Amātu  (awātum), “word.”  Qibītu, “speech, command.” 
Ṣīru  (m),  ṣīrtu  (f),  “exalted,  august.”  É-kur  was  Enlil’s  temple  in  Nippur.  Šurbât  is  a  3fs 
predicative related to šurbūtu, “exalted, supreme,” earlier in the line (and in line 1). This 
line  and  the  next  comprise  a  long  vocative  address,  directing  the  wishes  (third  person 
precatives) expressed in lines 17–19 to Gula’s attention. The first ina in this line governs a 
rather complex prepositional phrase that includes the rest of line 15 and all of line 16. The 
ša introduces a short relative clause that futher defines Gula’s authoritative word.

Line 16: Annu, “consent, approval.” The relative clause modifies Gula’s consent and 
grammatically parallels the relative clause in line 15. Kīnu, “firm, true.”  NU = lā, “not.” 
BAL = enû, “to change, to alter.” The inf. expresses the permanence or unchangeable quali-
ty of the deity’s word (see CAD E, 175), a common motif in Mesopotamian texts. 
 
   
Line 17: Târu, “to return, to turn back.” Nasḫuru (N of saḫāru), “to turn back, to turn 
again with favor to.” Note the ventive on both verbs. The supplicant, having gotten Gula’s 
attention in the previous lines, now begins expressing desires of reconciliation with their 
angry deities (named earlier in lines 11 and 12).

Line 19:  Ezēzu, “to be(come) angry, to be in a rage.” Nâḫu, “to rest, to relent.” Agāgu, 
“to  be(come)  furious.”  Napšuru  (N  of  pašāru),  “to  be  released,  to  be  reconciled,  to  be 
soothed, to forgive.” Ezēzu and agāgu occur together frequently (see CAD E, 427 for other 
examples).  The  line  consists  of  two  grammatically  and  semantically  parallel  parts.  One 
might even suggest a certain phonological similarity between the two as well. As with the 
personal  gods,  the  supplicant  makes  known  to  Gula  their  desire  for  reconciliation  with 
their angry city god. 
 
    
Line 20: Ṣabātu means “to seize” and abbūtu, “fatherhood, a fatherly attitude.” When 
used together the idiom abbūta ṣabātu means “to intercede for someone, to help someone’s 
cause” (see CAD Ṣ, 24–25). Despite the masculine connotation of the literal meaning of the 
words, the idiom may be applied to gods or, as here, goddesses (see also line 22). Enšu, 
“weak, powerless,” is used substantively. A fourth invocation echoes line 1 in the first part 
of  the  line.  The  second  part  contains  an  epithet,  which  may  be  interpreting  line  1’s 
rēmēnītû. In any case, it illustrates Gula’s mercy and concern for the less fortunate.

Line 21: dAMAR.UTU = Marduk (on whom, see page 291). LUGAL= šarru, “king.” EN = 
bēlu, “lord,” the masculine form of bēltu, used throughout the prayer. Rēmēnû, “merciful,” 
for  which  see  line  1.  Marduk is being described  with  many  of  the  same  words  used  for 
Gula earlier in the prayer. 
 
    
Line 22: Qabû, “to speak.” Damiqtu, “favorable, good,” is used substantively (“some-
thing favorable”). See CAD A/1, 50 for a similar line with 3ms pronominal suffixes on the 
substantives. In the first half of the line the supplicant appeals to Gula’s merciful nature, 
brought out already in line 20 with the same idiom as used here and earlier in lines 1 and 
7, where the supplicant invokes caring parental imagery (“merciful mother”). In the sec-
ond  half  of  the  line  the  supplicant appeals to  Gula’s effective  word  for  a favorable  pro-
nouncement  (see  lines 15 and 16). In  both parts of the line, the supplicant asks Gula  to 
present  the  supplicant  in a  good  light  before  Marduk.  The  assumption  seems  to  be  that 
Marduk will have the power to set things right. 
 
    
Line 23: Ṣulūlu, “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor of divine or royal protec-
tion  (see  CAD  Ṣ,  243).  Rapšu,  “wide.”  Tayyartu,  “forgiveness”  (tajārtu).  Kabtu,  “heavy, 
important, noble, honored.” Bašû, see line 5. The ending –nim is a 1cs dative suffix. This 
line brings to the goddess’s attention that her intercession with Marduk on the supplicant’s 
behalf  would  demonstrate  her  protection  and  forgiveness  for  him.  In  other  words,  the 
requested action in lines 21–22 and the requested relationship in line 23 are two sides of 
the same coin. 
 
    
Line 24: Gimillu, “requital, a return in kind, a friendly deed.” Dumqi, “goodness, pros-
perity.” Balāṭu, “life.” UGU = eli, “on, upon, on to.” Šakānu, “to put, to place, to provide.” 
The supplicant makes one final, summarizing plea to Gula, which recognizes her actions—
her acceptance of their prayer and successful intercession with Marduk on their behalf—as 
the key to future happiness and prosperity.

of foreword looking praise. The phrases used here are very common.

Line 26: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the 
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is 
directed. As is  typical, the rubric is written in  Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the 
wording of a lifted-hand to Gula.”  
   
Line 27: The ritual is fragmentary. The present text is based on Mayer’s MS G, but is 
not in his edition. Other MSS deviate from this one. DÙ.DÙ.BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” These 
words alert the user of the tablet that the ritual instructions follow. Compare the ÉN at the 
beginning of the prayer. IGI = maḫru, “front,” or pānu, “face.” According to Mayer, maḫru 
is the more likely reading for ina/ana IGI (see UFBG, 175–76). In any case, the meaning is 
the same.  KEŠDA = riksu, “ritual arrangement, assemblage of offerings.” Rakāsu, literally, 
“to bind, tie up,” but in ritual instructions the word means “to prepare, to set out (offer-
ings).” The other verbs  in the ritual instructions should be understood as second person 
verbs, too. KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” SAG = rēšu, “top, head, best.” Šikaru rēšu designates first-
rate beer, a very common item to libate. BAL = naqû, “to pour out, to libate, to sacrifice.” 
 
   
Line 28: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” Annītu, “this.” 3-šú = šalāšīšu, “three times.” ŠID = 
manû, “to recite, to count.” Teslītu, “petition, request.” Nešmû (N of šemû), “to be heard.” 
The final phrase indicates to its user that the ritual-prayer will be successful.

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
In  line  8  we learn that  the  goddess  exists  “among  the myriad  stars  of  the 
heavens”  (ina maʾdûti  kakkabī  šamāmī).  The  close  association  of  Mesopotamian 
gods and stars is well-known among contemporary scholars.1 For example, Gu-
la’s star is Lyra and her constellation is the one we call Hercules. This close con-
nection between stars and gods is enshrined in the cuneiform writing system: the 
divine determinative (DINGIR) looks like a star in the earliest pictographic forms 
 
1  The ancient Hebrew scribes were aware of the Mesopotamian connection, too. See, e.g., Amos 
5:26  and  the  comments  on  this  passage  by  Shalom  Paul,  Amos:  A  Commentary  on  the  Book  of 
Amos (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991), 194–97. See also my comments below on the “host of 
heaven.”

of the script.2 Given this, it is worth considering whether or not there is a similar 
relationship between divinity and stars in the Hebrew Bible.3 

Akkadian kakkabu is etymologically related to the BH word ב ָכוֹכּ, pl. םי ִב ְכוֹכּ. 
Like  Akkadian,  this  word  usually  designates  the  innumerable  group  of  small 
celestial objects that  are visibly dimmer  than the sun and  the moon  (see, e.g., 
Gen 37:9, Ecc 12:2). The Hebrew word “host” (א ָב ָצ)—a term closely associated 
with the  military  (both  in terms  of the  army,  e.g.,  Num  2:8,  and  its  activities, 
e.g.,  Num  31:14)—and  the  phrase  “host  of  heaven”  (
ם ִי ַמ ָשּׁ ַה  א ָב )  were  used  as 
collective designations for all the stars in the heavens (see, e.g., Isa 45:12, Deut 
4:19).  

 ְצ

There is some indication in the Hebrew Bible that stars were believed to be 
divine beings that could influence the events on earth. Judges 5:20, where stars 
fight from heaven against Sisera, is perhaps the best example of such an idea.4 
Stars were therefore venerated as deities both individually as, for example, the 
“queen of heaven” (ם ִי ַמ ָשּׁ ַה ת ֶכ ֶל ְמ), identified as Ishtar—our Venus, in Jer 7:18 and 
44:17–19, and collectively as the “host of heaven” (ם ִי ַמ ָשּׁ ַה א ָב ְצ) in, for example, 2 
Kgs 17:16, 21:3, 5, Jer 19:13, and Zeph 1:5. Some scholars have suggested this 
astral worship was a direct result of Assyrian and then Babylonian influence.5 In 
any case, all such worship was illicit and condemned repeatedly by biblical au-
thors  (see  the  previous  references  and,  e.g.,  Deut  17:2–5,  2  Kgs  23:4–5,  Job 
31:26). In fact, Deut 4:19 informs the Israelites that Yahweh gave the worship of 
celestial bodies to other nations, not to Israel. 

Although the Hebrew deity’s dwelling was in the heavenlies (Ps 103:19), as 
high as the stars (Job 22:12, Isa 14:13), it is significant that Yahweh himself is 
never described as a star in the Hebrew Bible. Rather, Yahweh is always consid-
ered  superior  to  anything  in  the  celestial  sphere.  The  stars  and  the  heavenly 
host, for example, are often said to be created or counted or in some way con-
trolled by Yawheh (e.g., Gen 1:16, 2:1, Ps 8:4, 136:9, 147:4, Jer 31:35, Job 9:7 
[see v. 9], Ezek 32:7, Isa 13:10, 40:26, Joel 2:10, 15 [and see Amos 5:8 and Job 
38:31–32,  which  name  particular  stars]).  In  Ps  148:2–4  celestial  bodies  offer 
praise to Yahweh; in Neh 9:6 the host of heaven bow down to him, their creator; 
and in Job 25:5 the stars are said to be impure compared to the Hebrew god. 

Yet Yahweh’s royal retinue, his servants that surround him in the divine as-
sembly,  is  sometimes  identified  as  the  heavenly  host  (1  Kgs  22:19,  2  Chron 
 
2  See Erica Reiner, Astral Magic in Babylonia (TAPS 85/4; Philadelphia: The American Philosoph-
ical Society, 1995), 1–7. 
3  See  F.  Lelli,  “Stars,”  DDD,  809–15  and  H.  Niehr,  “Host  of  Heaven,”  DDD,  428–30  for  useful 
surveys in this matter, with references to other relevant resources. 
4  Another important context for seeing the connection between stars and divinity is Isa 14:12–
15, where a divinized king’s hubris is punished by Yahweh with expulsion from among the stars. 
See Mattias Albani, “The Downfall of Helel, the Son of Dawn: Aspects of Royal Ideology in Isa 
14:12–13,” in The Fall of the Angels (ed. Christoph Auffarth and Loren T. Stuckenbruck; Themes 
in Biblical Narrative; Leiden: Brill, 2004), 62–86.

18:18;  and  note  Ps  103:20–21  and  148:2,  where  וי ָא ָב ְצ,  “his  hosts,”  and  וי ָכ ָא ְל ַמ, 
“his messengers,” are in parallel) or stars (see Job 38:7, where ר ֶקֹב י ֵב ְכוֹכּ, “morn-
ing stars,” and םי ִה ֱא י ֵנ ְבּ־ל ָכּ, “all the sons of god,” are in parallel). Yahweh stands 
over these lesser divine beings (who are apparently not gods) as their king (Ps 
103:19–21).  

Yahweh himself was therefore not closely associated with a particular star 
as was Gula; rather, he was the creator (Isa 40:26, Neh 9:6) and ruler of the ce-
lestial host (see Ps 89:6–9).

ISHTAR:   

 

See page 169. 

THE PRAYER:  

The prayer Ishtar 2 is unique in its form, length, and transmission. Only one 
of its six textual witnesses known in Akkadian preserves a subscription that clas-
sifies  the prayer  as  a  “prayer  of the lifting of the  hand”  (šu-íl-lá).  The present 
treatment of the prayer follows this tablet exclusively, the only copy in which no 
text is missing (MS A in Zgoll’s edition). Its provenance is unknown. The tablet is 
in the British Museum today (BM 26187). The colophon describes it as a votive 
offering  in  the  temple  Esagila  in  Babylon,  being  the  copy  of  an  original  from 
Borsippa. Two copies of the prayer were found in Boğazköy, one of them in Ak-
kadian (MS F in Zgoll), and a very fragmentary second one in Hittite.1 Together 
with a tablet from the Emar region containing Ishtar 10,2 these tablets are the 
only attestations of prayers from the second millennium that are later known as 
shuillas,  though  neither  this  classification  nor  any  other  subscription  is  pre-
served in these early copies.3 Despite the fragmentary state of the Akkadian text 
from Boğazköy, it can be demonstrated that it contained a shorter version of the 
prayer  in  which  the  praise  of  the  deity  was  proportionally  much  more  im-
portant.4 

The structure of the prayer can be established by correlating aspects of form 
(the various uses of first, second, and third person voice, preponderance of nom-
inal clauses and/or predicative constructions versus imperatives and precatives)

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

and content. The beginning and the end of the prayer are formed by (hymnic) 
invocations of the deity (lines 1–41, 103–105), the middle section is character-
ized by two petitions (lines 42–55, 79–102) framing a complaint (lines 56–78).5  
The  first  invocation  (lines  1–41)  contains  epithets  and  sentences  praising 
Ishtar’s astral radiance, her power and prowess, and her  cosmic and cultic im-
portance.  This  long  section  of  praise  culminates  in  the  mentioning  of  Ishtar’s 
function as righteous and pardoning judge (lines 25–26) and her attention to the 
weak and sick (lines 40–41). Ishtar is the subject of inflected verbs only in these 
two passages of the opening invocation. Throughout the invocation, the suppli-
cant  approaches  Ishtar  in  various  ways:  the  address  changes  several  times  be-
tween third person and the more intimate second person voice. 

The beginning of  the first petition (lines 42–55) corresponds to the begin-
ning of the prayer: the supplicant mentions an act of invocation (line 42, com-
pare line 1) and characterizes themselves as weak and in pain, just after having 
praised Ishtar’s saving of the weak and sick in general (lines 40–41). The main 
aim  of  the  first  petition  is  to  gain  Ishtar’s  attention  and  to  pray  for  her  for-
giveness (lines 45–50), as her wrath seems to be the most important reason for 
their suffering (lines 45, 51–52). 

The  complaint  (lines  56–78)  describes  the  suffering  of  the  supplicant  and 
the hostility of enemies and others. The  state of the supplicant  is compared to 
natural  phenomena  (lines  62–64).  The  supplicant  does  not  find  fault  in  their 
behavior, but feels to be treated as if they had neglected the personal protecting 
deities  (lines  67–68).  The  supplicant  is  separated  from  deities  and  humankind 
and is already in the sphere of death (line 74). They are not active: in most cases 
in which they are the subject, the verb is either intransitive or the form is a pre-
dicative construction. 

The second petition (lines 79–102) is dominated by precise requests for Ish-
tar’s action and her care for the supplicant. They hope for an end of the disturb-
ance  in  their  relations  to  both  gods  and  humans.  Only  here  do  they  mention 
their guilt, but the terminology is comprehensive (lines 80–82). The supplicant 
hopes for Ishtar’s intervention against enemies (lines 97–98) so that they them-
selves will be judged as a living demonstration of her might (lines 101–102). 

The final section of invocation and praise (lines 103–105) forms the antici-
pated praise of the supplicant and the witnesses of Ishtar’s saving actions on the 
supplicant’s behalf (compare lines 101–102). Most of the vocabulary is derived 
from the beginning of the prayer (lines 1–5). Thus, the final praise forms an in-
clusio with the very beginning of the prayer. The ritual instruction demands the 
 
5  The  structure  can  also  be  analysed  differently;  compare  Wright,  116;  Reiner  and  Güterbock, 
263; Mayer, UFBG, 28–29, n.60;  Zgoll, 69. The differences  are  caused by transitional passages 
leading from one main part to the next and by differing analyses of the overall structure of the 
prayer (see Zernecke, 99–100). Mayer, UFBG, 28–29, n.60 characterizes Ishtar 2 as an atypical 
shuilla because of its length, its elaborated structure, the repetitions of certain words and phrases 
(“litaneiartig”) and the exceptional and partly literary motifs.

prayer  to  be  recited  three  times  (lines  109–110).  Thereby,  beginning  and  end 
would merge.6 

Ishtar  2  is  a  very  complex prayer with  an  elaborate  structure.  Only  a  few 
aspects of the complex framework of references interlacing all parts can be men-
tioned  here. The first lines of every part establish the mode of speech and the 
main topic of the following lines. Furthermore, several “seams” are highlighted 
by the use of terms for speech and prayer (lines 1, 42, 79–80). Also, the seman-
tic  field  of  sight,  face,  care, and  aversion  pervades  the prayer  in  different  and 
characteristic  nuances.  The  relationship  between  Ishtar  and  the  supplicant 
changes in the course of the prayer. This can be shown best in the way the god-
dess is addressed: in both invocations, a variety of names is used (Ishtar, Irnini, 
and Gushea) and—among others—the title bēlet, “lady.” In both petitions and in 
the complaint, she is almost exclusively addressed as bēltī, “my lady,” thus  ac-
centuating  the personal relation  between  the  supplicant  and  the goddess.7  The 
overall  structure  of  the  prayer  can  be  described  as  approaching  Ishtar  for  the 
request  that  is  reinforced  by  the  complaint,  and  then  withdrawing  out  of  the 
presence of the goddess. The ritual demanding the repeated recitation emphasiz-

No normalization of this text has been published so far. This is possibly not 
without reason, as the written vowels frequently do not correspond to the stand-
ard grammar, especially at the end of the words. So every attempt to transcribe 
the text “normalizes” it “away” from the textual witness. The normalization giv-
en here tries to follow the text.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, the superscription of the prayer, corresponding to the subscription 
in line 106. Both superscription and subscription are not part of the prayer itself, but form 
a frame for the text to be recited. Šiptu, derived from the same root as āšipu, the designa-
tion  for  the  ritual  specialist,  is  usually  translated  as  “incantation”  (CAD  Š/3,  86).  This 
translation suggests a classification of the following text as “magical.” As the opposition of 
“magic” and “religion” is obsolete, šiptu should be understood as a technical term for the 
beginning of the text to be recited in a ritual. Compare Mayer, UFBG, 22–23 and Zernecke, 
326. Sullû, a D preterite  with suffix, “to  implore, to pray  to,” can  be interpreted as per-
formative (Koinzidenzfall), Mayer, UFBG, 181–209. The same form occurs again in line 80 
at the beginning of the second petition. Bēltu, “lady.” Iltu, “goddess.” 

šiptu: usallīki bēlet bēlēti ilat ilāti   

Line 2: Šarratu, “queen.” Šarrat is the expected bound form; the vowel at the end in 
our text is unnecessary, which is not atypical in late Babylonian copies. Kullatu, “whole.” 
Dadmū,  “inhabited  world.”  Šarrati  kullat  dadmē  is  a  construct  chain.  Šutēšuru  (Št  lex.  of 
ešēru), “to guide aright.” Tenēštu, “people, personnel,” pl. tenēšētu, “humankind.” The par-
ticiple, muštēširat, is used here to characterize Ishtar’s action towards humankind. In line 
26 the objects of her guidance are the wronged and afflicted (compare ešēru in the G stem 
in  line  41),  whereas  in  line  84  (imperative  Št  lex.)  the  supplicant  uses it  to ask  her  for 
guidance. 

Ištar šarrati kullat dadmē muštēširat tenēšēti  

Line 3: dIrnini is an alternative name of Ishtar. Muttallu (muttellu), “noble.” The form, 
muttallāti, is a 2fs predicative. This is the first time the goddess is addressed in the second 
person. Rabû (m), rabītu (f), “big, great.” Ra-bat is problematic. As rabāt, the word may be 
an unexpected fem. sg. form of the adj. bound to the following gen. (see CAD R, 37 and 
the analogous leʾāt in line 32). Rabīt Igigî, “greatest of the Igigi,” is one of Ishtar’s epithets 
(see page 112 for an example in an OB hymn). Alternatively, perhaps ra-bat is the 3fs pre-
dicative,  rabât,  “she is  great,”  but  the  change  of  person in  the middle  of  the line  seems 
odd. Igigû is a general name for the gods of heaven, in contrast to Anunnakkū, who are the 
gods of the netherworld (see Black and Green, 106; in Enūma eliš VI 69 the Igigû number 
three hundred and the Anunnakkū six hundred whereas in VI 39–44, contradictorily, the 
two groups both number three hundred).

Line 4: The predicatives continue in this line. Gašru, “powerful, very strong.” Malkatu, 
“ruler (f), queen.” Šumu, “name.” Ṣīru, “exalted.” Ishtar’s name(s) are also praised in lines 
15, 20, 22. 

gašrāti malkāti šumūki ṣīrū 
 Line 5: Attī, “you” (fs). Nannartu, “luminary, light of the sky.” AN = šamû, “heaven”; 
also in lines 20, 27, and 35. Interestingly, in lines 13 and 63, “heaven” is written syllabi-
cally as šá-ma-mi (gen. of šamāmū). But in both lines, this is not in the formula “heaven 
and earth.”  KI.TIM =  erṣetu, “earth,” also in lines 13, 20, 27,  35. Zgoll, 61  classifies this 
writing as pseudologographic or archaizing. Mārtu, “daughter.”  d30 = Sîn, the moon god 
(see page 385). Qardu (m), qarittu (f), “heroic, valiant.” We expect qaritti here to be in the 
nominative (qarittu), as in Zgoll’s  MS C. The epithet mārat Sîn qaritti reappears as the last 
words of the prayer in line 105. 

attī-ma nannarat šamê u erṣeti mārat Sîn qaritti 
 Line 6: Ittabbulu (Gtn of [w]abālu), “to look after, to maintain, to serve; to control, to 
steer.” Muttabbilat is the Gtn participle. GIŠ.TUKUL = kakku, “weapon.” Šakānu, “to put, to 
place, to arrange.” Tuquntu (tuqumtu), “battle.” 

muttabbilat kakkī šākinat tuqunti 
 Line  7:  Ḫamāmu,  “to  gather, to  collect.”  Gimru,  “totality,  all.”  Apāru,  “to  cover  the 
head, to wear on the head.” Agû, “crown.” Bēlūtu, “lordship.” Because of the varied mean-
ings  of  parṣu  (also,  line  15),  “rite,  ritual;  temple  office;  divine  authority,  power,  office; 
symbol, insignia; authoritative decision, command, decree; custom, practice” (see CAD P, 
195), the translations of this line differ widely. See Zgoll, 61.  

ḫāmimat gimir parṣī āpirat agê bēlūti 
 Line 8: GAŠAN = bēltu, here a vocative; compare lines 29 and 104. Interestingly, this 
title in this form is used only in the invocations. In the petitions and the complaint, bēltu is 
always written with a first person pronominal suffix (dGAŠAN.MU = bēltī, lines 43, 56, 59, 
72, 73, 79, 93, 94). Bēltu is only written with a logogram when it is vocative. In all other 
cases (genitive constructions), be-let is found (lines 1, 11, 27, 28, 30). Šūpû, “resplendent, 
manifest.”  Narbû,  “greatness”  (s),  “great  feats”  (pl).  UGU  =  eli,  “on,  over,  above.”  Kalû 
(absolute, kala), “all.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.”

 Line 9: MUL = kakkabu, “star.” Tanūqātu, “battle cry.” Šutamḫuṣu (Št lex. of maḫāṣu), 
“to cause constant enmity” (see CAD M/1, 84). ŠEŠ = aḫu, “brother.” Mitguru, “harmoni-
ous.” 

kakkab tanūqāti muštamḫiṣat aḫḫī mitgurūti 
 Line  10:  Itaddunu  (Gtn  of  nadānu),  “to  give  constantly,  repeatedly.”  Itbāru,  “friend, 
colleague.” Compared to the rest of the text, this line is half as long as a normal line. But 
on the tablet BM 26187, it is written as a whole line. Compare line 92, where the second 
part of the line is erased. 

muttaddinat itbāru 

Line 11:  Itburtu is a hapax legomenon. AHw, 263 (etpuru) derives it from apāru and 
translates  “mit Tiara  geschmückt” (“adorned with a Tiara”), compare  CDA, 136 (itpuru). 
Zgoll, 62 explains the form as a Gt verbal adjective of abāru / ubburu, characterizing Ish-
tar’s strength; see CAD I/J, 295. The same meaning is assumed in the translations of Foster 
(“Strong (?) one,” 601) and Stephens (“O mighty one,” 384). Tūšaru (tūšāru), “battlefield, 
pitched  battle.”  Muttakkipu,  “goring,  knocking  over”  (based  on  the  Gtn  participle  of 
nakāpu).  Zgoll,  62  identifies  šá-di-ia  as  a  late  Babylonian  writing  for  šadî,  “mountains” 
(gen.). 

itburti bēlet tūšari muttakkipat šadî 
 Line 12: Gušea is an alternative name for Ishtar, related to the poem of Agushaya and 
Ishtar’s function as goddess of war (see Zgoll, 62). Ḫalāpu, “to slip into,” but in the predic-
ative  (as  here,  3fs),  “clad  in.”  Labāšu,  “to  clothe  oneself”;  predicative,  “clothed  with.” 
Ḫurbāšu, “terror, frost.”  

Gušea ša tuqunta ḫalpat labišat ḫurbāša 
 Line  13:  Gamāru,  “to  bring  to  conclusion,  to  settle.”  Šipṭu,  “judgment,  verdict,”  is 
mentioned again in line 73 as something the supplicant has witnessed and is a source of 
his complaints.  EŠ.BAR  = purussû, “decision.”  Ûrtu  ([w]uʾʾurtu), “command,  commission.” 
KI.TIM = erṣetu, compare line 5, also concerning the syllabical writing of šamāmū, “heav-
en,” which can be found twice in this text, always at the end of the line (lines 13, 63).  

gamrāti šipṭa u purussâ ûrtī erṣeti u šamāmī 
 Line 14: Sukku, “shrine, chapel.” Ešertu, “shrine, chapel.” Nēmedu, “base,” as a desig-
nation of a sanctury.  BÁRA = parakku, “cult dais, sanctuary.” Line 14 is one of the most

RA.MEŠ  is  an  enumeration,  all  nouns  function  as  subjects  of  upaqqū  and  all  of  them  are 
probably to be analyzed as nom. plural. Kâši, “to you.” The verb puqqu, “to pay attention 
to,” can be found again in  line 79 at the  very  beginning of  the second petition. In  both 
cases, Ishtar is the object. In line 79, the supplicant is the subject. 

sukkū ešrēti nēmeda u parakkū upaqqū kâši 
 Line  15:  Ēkīam,  “where?”  MU  =  šumu,  “name,”  see  also  line  22.  Parṣu,  see  line  7. 
Lines 15–17 all begin with ēkīam lā. This is not the only chain of lines beginning with the 
same word or groups of words; in fact, it is one of the typical features of this prayer (see 
lines 27–30, 46–50, 72–73, and 93–94). Note that only the repetitions in the first invoca-
tion have parallels in the version from Boğazköy (lines 15–16, 27–30). 

ēkīam lā šumki ēkīam lā parṣūki 

Line 16:  GIŠ.ḪUR =  uṣurtu, “drawing, plan,” in the plural, “ordinances” of the gods. 
Note the figura etymologica with uṣṣuru (D of eṣēru), “to draw, to  plan.” ŠUB = nadû, “to 
throw, to lay down,” also of foundations. The translation “set up” follows Foster, 602. BÁRA 
= parakku, see line 14. 

ēkīam lā uṣṣurā uṣurātīki ēkīam lā nadû parakkūki 
 Line 17: The adjectives rabû and ṣīru, in 2fs predicative form here, are used several 
times in correspondence to characterize Ishtar. Rabû can be found in lines 3, 17, 23, and in 
line 100 in an intensified form (rabbû); see also rabû, the verb with the same root, in lines 
18 (Š) and 34 (G). Ṣīru is equally used several times for Ishtar: lines 4, 17, 23, 103, and 
104. Line 17 therefore structures the text by relating to the combination of both adjectives 
in lines 3 and 4 and to line 23. Lines 17 and 23 are especially parallel; they form a frame 
around the passage dealing with Ishtar’s exaltation (lines 18–22). 

ēkīam lā rabâti ēkīam lā ṣīrāti 
 Line 18: Anum, the god of heaven, see page 217. Ellil, the god of wind. Ea, the god of 
water,  wisdom,  and  magic,  see  page  227.  These  three  gods  are  the  highest  gods  in  the 
Mesopotamian pantheon. Ullû (D of elû), “to raise, to elevate.” Ina, “in, among, at.” The 
line consists of two clauses. Ina ilī stands between both and can be understood as part of 
either. Šurbû (Š of rabû), “to make great, to aggrandize, to promote, to magnify.” Lines 18–
19  (in  fact,  through  line  22)  refer  to  Ishtar’s  exaltation  among  the  gods,  which  is  also 
known from a separate text: Blahoslav Hruška, “Das spätbabylonische Lehrgedicht ‘Inannas 
Erhöhung,’” ArOr 37 (1969), 473–522. In this text, Ishtar is made the queen of heaven and 
earth and receives supreme power. In the present context (lines 18–22) the structure of the 
text changes: verbal clauses dominate.

 Line 19: Šašqû (Š of šaqû), “to exalt, to elevate.” Napḫaru, “total, sum, entirety.” As 
with ina ilī in line 18, ina napḫar Igigî can be understood as pertaining to both clauses in 
the  line.  Šūturu  (Š  of  [w]atāru),  “to  make  surpass,  to  make  excel.”  Manzāzu  (mazzāzu), 
“position, rank, abode.” 

ušašqûki ina napḫar Igigî ušātirū manzāzki 
 Line 20: Ḫissatu sometimes means “understanding, wisdom,” but here connotes “men-

tion, thought.” Râbu, “to shake, to tremble.”

 Line 23: See line 17. 
attī-ma rabâti u ṣīrāti 
 Line  24:  Ṣalmāt  qaqqadi,  “black-headed  ones,”  refers  to  humankind.  The  imagery 
comes  from  the  simile  of  people  as  sheep  in  need  of  leadership.  Nammaššû  (nammaštû), 
“moving  things,  animals,  herds;  settlement,  people.”  Qurdu  (s),  “heroism,”  (pl),  “heroic 
acts.”  Dalālu,  “to  praise,  to  glorify,”  is  interpreted  in  the  translations  as  having  two  or 
three subjects, with nam-maš-šu-ú te-né-še-e-ti as either a construct chain or as two nomina-
tives. The vowel ending of nam-maš-šu-ú makes the interpretation as construct chain more 
probable. An interpretation as two nominatives cannot explain the ending vowel of te-né-
še-e-ti. The translation given here follows Zgoll, 50, in analyzing the two words as a con-
struct chain. 

napḫar ṣalmāt qaqqadi nammaššû tenēšēti idallalū qurdīki 
 Line  25:  Dīnu,  “legal  decision,  lawsuit.”  Baḫūlātu  (baʾūlātu),  “subjects,  people, 
troops.” Kittu, “truth.” Mīšaru, “justice.” Dânu (diānum), “to judge.”  Lines  25 and 26 are 
very important for the characterization of Ishtar in the first invocation: only here and in 
line 40 is she the subject of inflected verbs, all of which are in the present (durative) in its

habitual function. Ishtar’s actions are described; her astral dimensions, cosmic importance, 
or prowess in war are set aside: she is a righteous judge. Interestingly, lines 25–26 have no 
parallel in the version from Boğazköy. 

dīn baḫūlāti ina kitti u mīšari tadinnī attī 
 Line 26: This line is central for the connection between the first invocation and the 
rest of the text.  The verb  Naplusu (N of  palāsu),  “to look at, to  look  favorably upon,” is 
used for the first time to characterize Ishtar’s action as regards suffering. In line 40, she is 
again subject of this verb. In the later parts of the prayer, the petition kīniš naplisīnnī-[ma], 
“look faithfully upon me,” is repeated three times (lines 44, 54, 92); it is the most frequent 
petition and is clearly related to the description of Ishtar’s actions in lines 26 and 40. The 
second verb, šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to guide aright,” connects line 26 to the very be-
ginning of the prayer (line 2) and is also used at the end of the invocation (line 41) and in 
a petition (line 84, see the note to line 2). Ishtar is helpful towards the ḫablu, the “wronged 
person,” and the šagšu (verbal adj. of šagāšu “to kill, to slaughter”), here translated as “af-
flicted”—apparently a person in a life-threatening situation. Uddakam, “every day, forev-
er.” 

tapallasī ḫablu u šagšu tušteššerī uddakam 
 Line 27: Lines 27–30 begin with aḫulap, “an exclamation used to express or to seek 
compassion”; the word denotes both the mercy granted by a god or king or the petition for 
such mercy (CAD A/1, 213–14; AHw, 22–23. See Zgoll, 75, n.164). Here aḫulap (with a 2fs 
suffix and always followed by an address to Ishtar) is Ishtar’s answer to prayers, which is 
praised by the supplicant. See the corresponding lines 45–50, which also begin with aḫulap 
but this time with a 1cs suffix or as regens in a construct chain with this suffix. There, in 
the first petition, the supplicant prays for Ishtar’s verbal action that they praise in lines 27–
30. Rēʾâtu (rēʾītu), “shepherd” (f). UN.MEŠ = nišū, “people.” Apâtu, “numerous, teeming.”  

aḫulapki bēlet šamê u erṣeti rēʾât nišī apâti 
 Line 28: E-ana (E-anna) is the name of Ishtar’s temple in Uruk. Quddušu, “holy, con-
secrated.” Šutummu, “storehouse,  treasury.” Ellu, “pure,  clean, holy.”  We expect the gen. 
case ending on the last three words. 

aḫulapki bēlet Eanna quddušu šutummu ellu 
 Line 29: See the notes to line 8. GÌR = šēpu, “foot”; II = the dual sign. Anīḫu (āniḫu), 
“tired.”  Lāsimu, “swift.” Both adjs. are used predicatively (3fp).  Birku, “knee.” Like  šēpu, 
birku is a dual.

Tamḫārī (gen. pl.), “battles, combats”, is a second nomen rectum. Kalîšunu, “all of them,” 
breaks the chain and is probably related to both recta. 

aḫulapki bēlet tāḫāzī kalîšunu tamḫārī 
 Line 31: The MEŠ sign is actually a ME on the tablet; the exclamation point marks 
the correction. Šūpūtu is the fem. sg. form of šūpû, for which see line 8. Labbatu (lābatu), 
“lioness.” Kunnušu (D of kanāšu), “to subject, to force submission.” Sabsu (šabsu), “angry.” 
Mukannišat ilī sabsūti is an important epithet for the course of the prayer because it corre-
sponds to  several  petitions:  compare  the  use  of  sabsu in  line  86 and  the  combination  of 
sabsu and  kanāšu (D stem)  in line  98 (Zgoll, 94; Zernecke,  149).  In lines 31–33,  Ishtar’s 
rule over all humankind is detailed depending on their social rank. 

šūpūtu labbat Igigî mukannišat ilī sabsūti 
 Line 32: Lēʾû (m), lēʾītu (f; also lēʾātu, see CAD L, 160), “powerful, capable.” Malku, 
“prince.”  We  expect  the  oblique  plural  to  be  malkī.  Ṣabātu,  “to  hold,  to  seize.”  Ṣerretu, 
“nose-rope,” was a rope tied to a ring that pierced the nose of an animal in order to con-
trol it. The same method was used on captive humans (see CAD Ṣ, 136–37 for a brief dis-
cussion). LUGAL = šarru, “king.” 

lēʾāt kalîšunu malkū ṣābitat ṣerret šarrī 
 Line 33: Petû, “to open.” Pētât is a fs participle, bound form. Pusummu, “veil.” KI.SIKIL 
=  (w)ardatu,  “girl,  young  woman.”  This  (and  possibly  line  39)  is  the  only  reference  to 
Ishtar’s otherwise prominent function as erotic goddess. 

pētât pusummē ša kalîšina ardāti 
 Line 34: Nanšû (N of našû), “to be raised.” Nandû (N of nadû), “to be laid down.” The 
first two words of the line can be understood as 3fs predicatives, uncontracted nanšeat for 
expected nanšât and uncontracted nandiat for nandât (see GAG §102c). The content is diffi-
cult to understand. Since a reference to defeat is hardly probable in such a hymnic context, 
an astral interpretation, relating to the different positions of the planet Venus, seems to be 
most plausible  (Zgoll, 50,  n.130; Zernecke, 80, n.36). The CAD offers  two other alterna-
tives. On the one hand, CAD N/2, 111 cautiously interprets the words as 2fs predicative 
forms of našû and nadû and translates them with a military interpretation: “whether you 
have been elevated or brought down, heroic Ištar (your warlike deeds are great).” CAD E, 
379, 413, on the other hand, takes the words as forms of ešû and eṭû and translates, “(Ish-
tar) is disturbed, gloomy.”

 Line 36: Ezzu (m), ezzetu (f), “furious,” is used substantively here. Qablu, “battle.” Lā 
maḫār, “not confrontable, not opposeable; irresistible.” Qablu lā maḫār can be understood 
as  a  frozen  construction  that  was  used  as  an  adjective  (see  Burkhart  Kienast,  “qabal  lā 
maḫār,” JCS 29 [1977], 73–77). Alīlu (m), alīltu (f), “powerful,” is also used substantively. 

ezzet qablu lā maḫār alīlat tamḫāri 
 Line  37:  Akukūtu,  “firebrand.”  Ayyābu,  “enemy.”  Napāḫu,  “to  light  up,  to  ignite.” 

Šakānu, see line 6. Šaḫluqtu, “destruction, annihilation.” Ekdu, “furious, wild.”  

akukūtu ša ana ayyābī napḫat šākinat šaḫluqti ekdūti 
 Line 38: Mummiltu is often used for Ishtar, but it is not clear from which root it is de-
rived.  Two  possibilities  are  discussed:  mummillu,  derived  from  mēlulu  (“dancer,  player, 
actor”),  would  lead  to  a  translation  as  “dancing  Ishtar”  (see  CAD  M/2  196  and  Foster, 
603). The alternative is a D participle of (w)amālu, “to veil, to darken, to eclipse,” but also 
used in connection with scintillating stars (AHw, 1459). In this latter case the word can be 
understood as being related to Ishtar’s astral aspect (“scintillating, glimmering”), see Zgoll, 
51;  Zernecke,  81,  n.38.  Puḫḫuru  (D  of  paḫāru),  “to  bring  together,  to  assemble.”  Puḫru, 
“assembly.” 

mummiltu Ištar mupaḫḫirat puḫri 
 Line 39: NITA = zikaru, “male, man.” MUNUS = sinništu, “female, woman.” dIštar is in 
this  case  probably  not  the  name  of  the  goddess  but  the  bound  form  of  the  noun  ištaru, 
“goddess.” Note the unequivocal instances of ištaru, “goddess,” in lines 67, 68, 86 (always 
with  ilu), which are also written with the determinative. Lamādu, “to learn.” Milku, “ad-
vice, counsel, plan.” Mamman, “somebody,” with neg. “nobody.” 
ilat zikarī ištar / Ištar sinnišāti ša lā ilammadu milikšu mamman 
 Line 40: Ašru, “place.” The bound form, ašar, indicates that a subordinate clause fol-
lows (comprising one verb); the word may be translated as “wherever.” Balāṭu, “to live, to 
be  healed.”  ADDA  (LÚ  X  ÚŠ)  =  mītu,  “dead,  dead  person.”  Tebû,  “to  rise  up,  to  get  up.” 
Marṣu, “sick, sick person.” As in lines 25–26, Ishtar here is the subject of an inflected verb, 
the N stem of palāsu, as in line 25 (see the notes to lines 25–26). The designation of the

person who receives help as marṣu is interesting, as the supplicant uses šumruṣu, derived 
from  the same  root and intensified in meaning, as a self-description only  two lines  later 
(line  42;  see also  lines  47 and  66).  In  the  complaint,  they  describe  themselves as  being 
already in the sphere of death (line 74). 

ašar tappallasī iballuṭ mītu itebbi marṣu 
 Line 41: Ešēru, “to be well, to thrive, to prosper.” Lā išaru is a substantive here, mean-
ing “the one who is not right.” Amāru, “to see, to look at.” The form of āmiru is a ms parti-
ciple,  bound  to  pānū,  “face.”  An “overhanging”  u  on a  participle  in  construct is  not  un-
common  in  SB  Akkadian  (see  Brigitte  R.  M.  Groneberg,  Syntax,  Morphologie  und  Stil  der 
jungbabylonischen  „hymnischen“  Literatur,  2  Vols.  [Freiburger  Altorientalische  Studien 
14/1–2; Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 2.41 for numerous examples). In lines 40–
41, at the end of the first invocation, Ishtar’s help for the afflicted is presented as eye con-
tact. The goddess’ gaze gives life (line 40); a look at the goddess puts one in order (line 
41). The motif of eye contact between Ishtar and the supplicant is central throughout the 
whole prayer. 

iššir lā išaru āmiru pānīki 
 Line 42: Anāku, “I.” Šasû, “to call out.” Alsīki is a 1cs preterite and is to be interpret-
ed as  performative  (see  line 1).  Anḫu,  “tired.”  Šūnuḫu,  “wearied.”  Both  adjs.  come  from 
anāḫu. Šumruṣu, “suffering” (adj.). ÌR = (w)ardu, “slave, servant.” Referring back to line 1, 
the supplicant mentions their act of praying at the beginning of the first petition (lines 42–
55; see the introduction to the prayer). There is no self-introduction in Ishtar 2, where the 
supplicant has to mention their or their father’s name (see Mayer, UFBG, 46–58). Instead, 
they introduce  themselves in line 42 with their  relation to  Ishtar as her servant (aradki) 
and as an afflicted  person,  therefore  already identifying  themselves as the  afflicted  who 
receives the help of the goddess (lines 25–26, 40–41). 

anāku alsīki anḫu šūnuḫu šumruṣu aradki 
 Line 43: A.MUR-in-ni-ma: Zgoll interprets this as an alternative (CVC for CC) writing 
for amrīnnī-ma, which is a G fs impv. with a 1cs suffix and enclitic –ma. This is not unique 
in the shuilla-prayers addressed to Ishtar (see Zgoll, 64, 189). dGAŠAN.MU = bēltī, see note 
to line 8. Leqû, “to receive, to accept.” Unnīnu, “supplication, petition.” In correspondence 
to the end of the invocation, the very first petition resumes the subject of eye contact: the 
supplicant asks the goddess to look at them. The second petition mentions the actual pray-
er. It is a typical stock-phrase, repeated in line 82 (see Mayer, UFBG, 217). 

amrīnnī-ma bēltī leqê unnīnīya 
 Line 44: Kīniš, “faithfully, truly.” Both petitions are typical (see Mayer, UFBG, 214, 
216); both deal with the central motifs of the prayer: the eye contact (again: palāsu in the 
N stem, here as an impv.; see the note to line 26) and the praying (teslītu, “prayer,” which

comes from the same root as sullû in lines 1 and 80). The petition kīniš naplisīnnī-[ma] is 
repeated three times in this single prayer (lines 44, 54, 92). Šemû, “to hear.”  

kīniš naplisīnnī-ma šimê teslītī 
 Line 45: See line 27. Both parts of the line are usual stock-phrases in petitions. Kabat-
taki  lippašra  appears  also  in  lines  52,  96.  See  Mayer,  UFBG,  226,  241.  Kabattu,  often  in 
parallel  to  libbu,  “heart”  (see  lines  51–52),  probably  denotes  the  liver,  but  more  often 
“emotions, thoughts, mind, spirit” (CAD K, 11). This reflects the physiological observation 
that the intestines react very strongly to negative situations (compare the use of “guts” in 
English!). Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled, to forgive.” Lippašra is a 
3cs precative with a 1cs dative suffix (–a). 

aḫulapīya qibî-ma kabattaki lippašra 
 Line 46: SU = zumru, “body, person.” Nassu, “groaning, wretched.” Malû, “to be full.” 
Although  it  looks  like  the  infinitive,  malû  is  a  3ms  predicative  with  the  subjunctive  –u, 
which  has  contracted  with  the  i  of  mali.  Ešû,  “confused.”  Dalḫu,  “troubled,  disturbed.” 
Lines 46–50 are part of the first petition, but already they give information about the suf-
fering of the supplicant. It is interesting that most of the vocabulary is not reused in the 
complaint (see Zernecke, 136). 

aḫulap zumrīya nassi ša malû ešâti u dalḫāti 
 Line 47: Šumruṣu modifies libbīya despite the presence of a nom. case ending. Dimtu, 
“tear,” is translated as plural, but it is singular; see also in line 50. Tānēḫu, “sighing, dis-
tress.” 

aḫulap libbīya šumruṣu ša malû dimti u tānēḫi 
 Line 48: Note that the omina (têrtu, “omen,” pl. têrētu) are qualified in the same way 

as the body in line 46 (nassu, ešû, and dalḫu). 

aḫulap têrētīya nassāti ešâti u dalḫāti 

Line 49:  É = bītu, “house.” Šudlupu, “sleepless, troubled.” Nussusu (D of nasāsu), “to 

lament, to wail, to moan.” ÉR = bikītu, “weeping, wailing, mourning.” 

aḫulap bītīya šudlupu ša unassasu bikâti 
 Line 50: See note on line 47. Šutabrû  (Št  lex. of bitrû), “to continue, to persevere.” 
Uštabarrû is a durative with subjunctive –u (see AHw, 123, sub berû/barû II and CAD  B, 
280, sub bitrû). Kabtatu (lines 50, 94) is an alternative form of kabattu (see line 45). The

description  of  the  suffering  of  the  supplicant’s  kabattu  (lines  50,  66)  corresponds  to  the 
petitions concerning Ishtar’s kabattu (lines 45, 52, 94, 96). 

aḫulap kabtatīya ša uštabarrû dimti u tānēḫi 
 Line 51: The interpretation of Irninītu (hapax legomenon) is dubious because of the 
erasure. As the text is very diligently written and corrected (see lines 32, 82, and 92), it is 
most  probably  to  be  considered  as  a  form  of  Ishtar’s  name  Irnini  (see  lines  3  and  105). 
Possibly, it is a mythical allusion (see Zgoll, 279). Labbu, “lion.” Nadru, “wild, aggressive.” 
Nâḫu, “to (be at) rest, to calm down.” Linūḫa is a 3cs precative with a 1cs dative suffix. 
This and the following line contain the first references to the supplicant as the object of 
Ishtar’s wrath. 

Irninītu labbu nadru libbaki linūḫa 
 Line 52: Rīmu, “wild bull.” Šabbasû, “very angry.” See also the notes to line 45. 
rīmu šabbasû kabattaki lippašra 
 Line 53:  SIG5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f; see line 95), “good, kind.” IGI = īnu, “eye”; 
with the dual sign. Bašû, “to be.” Eli, “on, over, upon.” This line and the following two, 
which conclude the first petition, contain yet another reference to the eye contact between 
supplicant and deity. 

damqātu īnāki libšâ elīya 
 Line 54: Būnu, “goodness, outward appearance,” pl. “face.” Namru (nawrum), “bright, 

shining.” See also the note to line 44.  

ina būnīki namrūti kīniš naplisīnni yâši 
 Line 55: Ukkušu (D of akāšu), “to drive away, to expel.” upīšū, “magical procedures,” 
is typically plural. We therefore expect upīšī here as the object of the impv. ḪUL = lemnu, 
“bad, evil.” SU = zumru, see line 46. ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.” Lūmur is a 1cs precative from 
amāru. 

ukkišī upīša lemnūti ša zumrīya nūrki namru lūmur 
 Line  56:  Adi  mati,  “how  long?”  The  complaint  (lines  56–78)  is  introduced  by  two 
questions (lines 56 and 59); in the second petition, another two questions have the same 
interrogative particle (lines 93–94). The seam of the text before line 56 is not stressed by 
references to the act of praying (see lines 1, 42, and 79–80), but the theme of eye contact 
is kept up, though it is now the malevolent regard of the enemies (nekelmû, “to frown at,

 Line  58:  Rēdû,  “pursuer,  persecutor.”  Ḫādû,  “one  who  rejoices,  gloats,” is a  person 
who takes pleasure in another’s misfortune. UGU = eli. We find ištammarū here instead of 
ištammurū, 3mp durative. The verb is the Gt of šamāru, “to be furious, to attack furiously, 
to rage”; see Zgoll, 64. 

rēdûya ḫādûya ištammarū elīya 
 Line  59: Lillu, “idiot.” Akû  can mean “cripple” or “powerless, weak,” depending on

pass, to overtake, to defeat.”

 Line 60: Panû, “to go ahead, to be in front.” Muqqu, “wearied.” Arkû (warkû), “rear,

erite.

 Line 64: Damāmu, “to wail, to moan.” Summatu, “dove, pigeon.” Mūšu, “night.” Urru, 

“day.” The simile is a stock-phrase used in several prayers, see Mayer, UFBG, 83. 

adammum kīma summatu mūši u urra 
 Line 65: The meaning of nangulāku (N 1cs predicative from nagālu) is uncertain; the 
verb  is  used  in  two different  contexts:  with stars as  subject  or  with  expressions  of emo-
tions, especially in complaints. Zgoll, 52, 65 translates as “glühend” (“glowing / burning”), 
because of a possible reference to a symptom of an illness. See Zernecke, 83. n.45. Bakû, 
“to weep, to cry.” Ṣarpiš, “bitterly.” 

nangulākū-ma abakki ṣarpiš 
 Line 66: Ūʾa, “woe! alas!” Â (ai), “alas!” See also line 42. 
ina ūʾa â šumruṣat kabattī 
 Line 67: Mīnâ (mīnu), “what?” Epēšu, “to do, to make.” In this line, the “third party 
involved”  is  introduced,  the  supplicant’s  personal  protective  deities.  Ištaru  with  suffix  is 
here definitely not the principal addressee of the prayer but used as a noun for “goddess.” 
Like Ishtar (see lines 51–52), the personal deities are angry, but the supplicant is not con-
scious of guilt or negligence (line 68). Foster, 604, understands the line as a direct address 
to the personal deities. As they are obviously not addressed in the following line 68, this 
singular change of direction of speech is improbable. 

mīnâ ēpuš ilī u ištarī anāku 
 Line 68: Kī, “as, like.” Palāḫu, “to fear, to revere.” The 1cs predicative elides the final 

vowel (epšēku becomes epšēk). 

kī lā pāliḫ ilī u ištarī anāku epšēk 
 Line 69: Diʾu, “headache.” Ḫuluqqû (ḫuluqqāʾu), “loss.” Šaḫluqtu, see line 37. 
šaknūnim-ma murṣu diʾi ḫuluqqû u šaḫluqti 
 Line 70: Pardāti: Zgoll, 46 reads per-da-a-ti; but as the first sign can also be read as 
par,  the  word  pardāti,  a  fem.  plural.  form  of  pardu,  “afraid,  fearful;  frightening,”  is  also 
possible. The adj. is used as a noun here, “terror, fright.” Suḫḫuru, “to turn away, toward.”

Libbātu, “rage, fury.” The infinitives are bound to the following nouns. 

šaknāni pardāti suḫḫur pānī u malê libbāti 
 Line  71:  Uzzu,  “anger.”  Uggatu,  “rage,  fury.”  Sibsatu  (šibsatu),  “anger,  angry  rejec-
tion.” Amēlūtu (amīlūtu), “humanity.” This enumeration of further pains is also dependent 
on šaknāni in line 70.  

uzzu uggati sibsat ilī u amēlūti 
 Line 72: UD (or U4) = ūmu, “day.” Ukkulu, “very dark.” ITI = (w)arḫu, “month.” Nan-
duru (naʾduru), “darkened, obscured, eclipsed.” MU = šattu, “year.” Niziqtu, “worry, grief.” 
Again, the motif of seeing and eye contact is taken up: the supplicant looks back and be-
holds  (amāru)  their  suffering,  whereas  they  hope  to  see  (amāru)  Ishtar’s  face.  Note  the 
other instances of amāru in lines 41, 43, and 101. 

ātamar bēltī ūmī ukkulūti arḫī nandurūti šanāti ša niziqti 
 Line 73: Šipṭu, see line 13. Išītu (ešītu), “confusion.” Saḫmaštu, “rebellion, uprising.” 
ātamar bēltī šipṭa išīti u saḫmašti 
 Line 74: Mūtu, “death.” Šapšāqu, “constraint, hardship.” Kullu (D), “to hold, to hold 
back.” The supplicant is already in the sphere of death. In line 73, they are the subject of a 
verb for the last time in the complaint section. Here in line 74, they themselves are men-
tioned for the last time. In the following lines, the supplicant has grammatically vanished 
and is present only in nouns that have a 1cs suffix. 

ukallânni mūtu u šapšāqu 
 Line 75: Šuḫarruru,  “to be deathly still.” Sagû (sāgu), “cella, shrine.” Aširtu (ešertu), 

“chapel, shrine.” The verb appears as a predicative in both instances (3ms and 3fs). 

šuḫarrur sagêya šuḫarrurat aširtī 
 Line 76: UGU: see line 8. KÁ = bābu, “gate, door.” Qarbatu (qerbetu), “environs, mead-

owland, field.” Šaqummatu, “deathly silence.” Tabāku, “to pour out.” 

eli bīti bābi qarbātīya šaqummati tabkat 
 Line 77: Ašaršanimma (ašaršani), “anywhere else.” See also lines 67–68 and 70.

 Line 78: Sapāḫu, “to scatter, to disperse.” Illatu, “family, group, clan.” Tabīnu, “shel-
ter.” Purruru  (D of parāru), “to scatter, to smash.” The first complaint in this line is taken 
up as a petition in line 89 (sapiḫtu illatī lipḫur). 

sapḫat illatī tabīnī purrur 
 Line 79: GEŠTU = uznu, “ear, wisdom, understanding.” Both preterites can be under-
stood as performatives (see line 1). With this line, the attention turns back from the suffer-
ing of the supplicant to Ishtar. See the relation to line 14 (puqqu D). At the beginning of 
the first invocation (line 1) and the first petition (line 42), the act of praying is mentioned. 
In line 79, at the beginning of the second petition (lines 79–102), the main stress lies at 
first on the awaiting of Ishtar’s reaction. 
upaqqa ana bēltīya kâši ibšāki uznāya 
 Line 80: Kâši, “to you,” is redundant with the pronominal suffix (–ki) on the verb; it 
probably serves to emphasize the supplicant’s calling out to the deity and it underlines the 
shift of attention from the supplicant back to the deity. Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, liability, sin.” 
Paṭāru , “to release, to absolve.” Now the act of praying is mentioned with direct reference 
to the very beginning of the prayer (line 1: usallīki bēlet bēlēti ilat ilāti). Only here does it 
become evident that the supplicant feels guilty despite the plea to the contrary in line 68. 
In line 81, however, there is a whole catalogue of terms for sin and guilt, which has paral-
lels in other prayers (see Mayer, UFBG, 115, n.93.). 

usallīki kâši eʾiltī puṭrī 
 Line 81: Arnu, “guilt, penalty, fault, sin.” Šērtu, “guilt, offense, punishment.” Gillatu, 

“sin.” Ḫiṭītu, “act of negligence, sin, offense.” 

puṭrī arnī šērtī gillatī u ḫiṭītī 
 Line 82: Mêšu, “to disregard.” Išītu, see line 73. See also line 43. 
mēšī gillātīya [gloss: išītīya] leqê unnīnīya 
 Line 83: Ru-um-mi-ia is to be read as rummî (D impv. from ramû, “to release, to un-
lock”), a late  Babylonian writing, see šadî in line 11 (Zgoll,  65).  Kīsu,  “bonds, binding.” 
Šubarrû, “freedom from service obligations,” with a 1cs suffix.

 Line 84: Kibsu, “step, track, route.” Namriš, “brilliantly, brightly.” Etelliš, “like a lord.” 
Itti, “with.” The verb šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), here as an imperative, is used twice in the 
first invocation to characterize Ishtar’s action towards mankind (see lines 2 and 26). The 
petition in this line refers back to these praises and shows the interconnection between the 
different  parts  of  the  prayer.  LÚ.TI  (or  LÚ.TÌL)  =  balṭu,  an  adj.  meaning  “alive,  safe  and 
sound.” In its substantival use, it means “living person.” Compare mītu in line 40. SILA = 
sūqu, “street.” 

šutēširī kibsī namriš etelliš itti balṭūti lubāʾ sūqa 
 Line  85:  Qibītu,  “command,  order.”  Zenû,  “angry.” Salāmu,  “to  be(come) at  peace.” 
Note  the  repetition  of  the  root  qabû,  which  is  not  translated  concordantly.  A  variant  in 
another textual witness (MS C: ilī ša iznû: “my god who was angry,” see Zgoll, 46) makes 
clear that the personal god is meant. 
qibî-ma ina qibītīki ilu zenû lislim 
 Line 86: In correspondence to the previous line, d15 is best understood as a substan-
tive (ištaru, “goddess”) and not as Ishtar’s name. Unfortunately, MS C, the alternative tex-
tual witness in line 85, is broken here. Târu, “to return, to turn back, to relent.” 

ištaru ša isbusa litūra 
 Line 87: Eṭû, “dark.” Qatru, “smoky.” Namāru (nawārum), “to become bright.” Kinūnu, 
“brazier.”  This and the  following  lines describe a state  of darkness but  petition  for  light 
and warmth. See the praise of Ishtar’s astral aspects in the first invocation (see, e.g., lines 
5, 35, and 37–38). 

eṭû qatru limmir kinūnī 
 Line  88:  Belû  (m),  belītu  (f),  “extinguished.”  Nanpuḫu  (N  of  napāḫu),  “be  ignited.” 

Dipāru, see line 35. 

belīti linnapiḫ dipārī 
 Line 89: Sapḫu (m), sapiḫtu (f), “scattered.” Paḫāru, “gather, assemble” (intransitive). 

See the corresponding complaint in line 78 and Ishtar’s characterization in line 38.

 Line  90:  TÙR  =  tarbaṣu,  “pen,  enclosure,  courtyard.”  Rapāšu,  “to  be(come)  broad, 
wide.” Supūru, “sheepfold.” Šutaddulu (Dt of šadālu), “to be widened, broadened.” Lištamdil 
is a 3cs precative, with reduplication via nasalisation (–dd– becomes –md–); see GAG §96j. 
The final –u, as with other cases in this late Babylonian MS, is superfluous. 

tarbaṣu lirpiš lištamdilu supūrī 
 Line 91: Magāru generally means “to consent, to agree,” but in this context of suppli-
cation  it  means  “to  hear,  to  grant.”  The  expression  lebēn  appa  is  not  usually  translated 
literally (“stroking of the nose”), see CAD L, 11 (sub labānu), “to beg humbly, to exhibit 
utmost humility (in gestures), to pray contritely.” It is usually found in the context of ges-
tures of praying, its function is to praise the gods and to accept their might; see Zgoll, 65; 
Zernecke, 84 n.51. Supû, “prayer, supplication.” 

mugrī lebēn appīya šimê supêya 
 Line 92: See lines 44 and 54. According to the first edition, “the second half of the 
line has been deeply erased  by the scribe”  (King, pl. LXXXIII). Several translations com-
plete the line with “accept my supplication” (see, e.g., King, 1.235; Stephens, 385). 

kīniš naplisīnnī-ma [...] 
 Line 93: See lines 56 and 59 for adi mati and line 85 for zenû, which is used predica-
tively here (2fs). In line 77, the same expression is used for the averted face of the person-
al deity (suḫḫurū pānū). Only here, at the end of the prayer, the supplicant can explicitly 
mention Ishtar’s wrath. It is a distinctive feature of this prayer that her anger is not “cam-
ouflaged” in a subordinate clause (see Zgoll, 65, 93; Mayer, UFBG, 96, n.58). 

adi mati bēltī zenâtī-ma suḫḫurū pānūki 
 Line 94: Raʾbu, “raging.” Uzzuzu (D of ezēzu), “to make furious,” but in the predica-

tive, “be infuriated.” 

adi mati bēltī raʾbātī-ma uzzuzat kabtatki 
 Line 95: SIG5 = damiqtu, “good, kind”; see line 53. Tirrī is a fs impv. from turru (D of 
târu), “to turn, to bend.” Kišādu, “neck.” Ta-ad-di-ia is a late Babylonian writing for taddî 
(see also lines 11 and 83; Zgoll, 65). The form is a G preterite from nadû, “to throw,” but 
in reference to a body part it frequently means “to drop.” Amātu (awātum), “word, matter.” 
Šakānu with pānū as the object, “to set the face,” means “to intend, to decide.”

 Line 96: A.MEŠ = mû, “water.” ÍD = nāru, “river, watercourse, canal.” For the second 
half of the line, see line 45. It is not clear to which act the reconciliation of the feelings is 
compared in the first half of the line. Pa-šìr can be analysed as a G predicative or participle 
of pašāru. Tertium comparationis is the water, but it is not clear if the water is calm, flow-
ing, or cleansing by flowing, or if this is a reference to the “undoing water” (mû pāširūtu) 
from namburbi-rituals. The translation follows Zgoll’s, “wie (durch) Wasser, den ‘Löser’ des 
Flusses,” who also offers a list of previous translations (53, 65–66). CAD P, 252–53 analyz-
es  the word as  pāširu,  an adjective of uncertain  meaning,  and lists this passage  together 
with the namburbi references. 

kīma mê pāšir / pašir nāri kabattaki lippašra 
 Line 97: Ekdu, see line 37. The adj. is used as a substantive here. Qaqqaru, “ground,

 Line 98: This petition clearly refers back to the praise in line 31. Kunnušu, see line

ally means “bottom, underside,” but one might translate the present usage as “under me” 
or even “at my feet.” 

sabsūtīya kunnišīm-ma šupalsiḫī ina šaplīya

 Line  100:  Tayyartu  (see  CAD  T,  58,  tajārtu),  “return,  forgiveness,” is  pl.  with a  2fs

(lines 101–102), which creates a transition to the following (second) invocation.

main clause. TUKU = išû, “to have.” Māḫiru, “opponent, enemy, rival.” 

Irnini mārat Sîn qaritti māḫirī ul īši 

Line 106: This line is the subscription of the prayer, corresponding to the superscrip-
tion at the beginning of line 1. In contrast to the superscription, the subscription is graph-
ically marked on the tablet by two rule lines. The form is typical for shuilla-prayers. 

Line 107: KÌD.KÌD.BI = kik(k)iṭṭûšu, “its ritual.” KI = ašru, see line 40. GÌR, see line 29. 
KU5 = parāsu, “to cut off, to keep away.” The phonetic complement suggests a 3fs predica-
tive, parsat. The first phrase in the line literally means “the place the foot is kept away.” 
One might better render it idiomatically (e.g., “in an inaccessible place”). ÙR = ūru, “roof.” 
SAR = šabāṭu, “to sweep.” We expect a 2ms durative in these kinds of ritual instructions. A 
= mû, see line 96. KÙ = ellu, see line 28. SUD = salāḫu, “to sprinkle.” SIG4 = libittu, “brick.” 
ḪI.A  is  a  plural  marker  like  MEŠ.  Šà-ḫa-a  (perhaps  ŠÀ.ḪA-a)  is  probably  šaḫâ,  a  very  rare 
word meaning “edge to edge” or “at angles” (see CAD Š/1, 75). ŠUB = nadû (see line 16). 

kik(k)iṭṭûšu: ašar šēpi parsat ūra tašabbaṭ mê tasallaḫ 4 libittī šaḫâ tanaddi 

Line 108: Lutû, “twigs.” GIŠ.ÁSAL = ṣarbatu, “Euphrates poplar.” Ṣênu, “to load up, to 
heap.”  IZI  =  išātu,  “fire.”  Nadû  with  fire  as  its  object  means  “to  kindle,  to  set  fire  to.” 
ŠIM.ḪI.A = rīqu (riqqu), an aromatic substance. ZÌ.MAD.GÁ = maṣḫatu, a kind of flour. ŠIM.LI 
= burāšu, “juniper” (pieces of wood or its resin).

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS: 

A  text  of  such  length  and  depth  as  Ishtar  2  comprises  many  aspects  that 
could be compared to biblical texts and their problems. Only two shall be men-
tioned  here: an interesting structural parallel concerning  the end of the prayer 
and the two stages of use of this text.1 

The  “Sudden  Change  of  Mood”—A  Structural  Parallel.2  A  sudden  transition 
from complaints and petitions to praise and promise to praise at the end of the 
text, the so-called sudden change of mood (“Stimmungsumschwung”), is a char-
acteristic feature of certain psalms of lament, though its interpretation is debat-
ed. One hypothesis reconstructs an oracle of salvation, which would have been 
spoken by a priest, between the complaints and the praise.3 The alternative in-
terpretation  explains  the  change  of  mood  within  the  course  of  the  prayer:  de-
spite describing a god-forsaken situation, the supplicant hopes that God is near 
during their time of despair. On this line of interpretation complaints and peti-
tions are enriched by elements of trust; the elements of continuity between com-
plaint and praise are stressed.4 

As there is also a sudden change of mood in the prayers of the lifting of the 
hand, it is strange that they have only rarely been used within this debate in Old 
Testament scholarship. In this point, it is possible to compare the texts, and the 
analogy is significant. The ritual instructions of the Mesopotamian prayers allow 
one to draw conclusions about the ritual context of the recitation. Ishtar 2 hopes 
for Ishtar’s verbal action, her “word of salvation,” in favor of the supplicant. But 
there  is  no  evidence  that  this  word  of  salvation  was  “performed”  in  any  way 
within the ritual procedure.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

In both types of prayer the final praise has two different functions, one for 
the relation between supplicant and deity and the other for the supplicant only. 
The promise and the appeal to praise can be understood as “offer of service” by 
the supplicant to the deity. They do not only promise to praise but to function 
themselves  as  living  examples  of  divine  action.  Such  an  unequivocal  “offer  of 
service” can also be found in biblical texts. Note the appeal to Yahweh to save 
the supplicant from the underworld, since no-one praises him there (see Ps 6:6, 
30:10, 88:11–12, Isa 38:18). Such an offer can be understood within the concep-
tion of the prayer as audience, which is important at least for the prayers of the 
lifting of the hand.5 The gift as greeting in an actual audience (corresponding to 
the offering in the hand-lifting ritual), the proskynesis, and the praise of the ele-
vated person aim at obligating the elevated person to help. The structure of the 
audience—and  the  prayer  respectively—want  to  make  the  counterpart  accept 
the petition. Because of the logic of reciprocity governing audiences in the an-
cient Near East, it is possible that the praying person already gives thanks and 
praise though their situation is still the same. 

The  concluding  praise  has  a  second  but  different  function  for  the  suppli-
cant.6 At the end of the prayer, they envision the power of the deity. They bring 
to mind the deity they experience as turned away, hoping that the god will act 
on their behalf. The certainty of salvation is realized in advance by articulating 
it. In this context, the basic character of the prayers as set forms, not as individ-
ual expression has to be kept in mind: praise and promise to praise that antici-
pate the salvation can strengthen the trust of the supplicant in the saving power 
of the deity. In this way, their function can be compared to the functions of the 
expressions of confidence in the psalms of lament and the hymnic invocation in 
the prayers of the lifting of the  hand. The  form invites the supplicant to leave 
behind the fixation on their own needs and to rest in the saving action by the 
deity. This structure can be compared to “de-reflection” in its psychotherapeutic 
sense. Prayers of the lifting of the hand can lead back from the final praise into 
the initial invocation in repeated recitations; psalms of lament can proceed from 
complaint to praise. The sudden change of mood can be interpreted as an ele-
ment of “pastoral care” in both cases, independent of the different structures of 
the prayers. 

The form of the sudden change of mood in Ishtar 2 is special: there is not 
only a promise to praise (lines 101–102) but the anticipated praise itself in the 
final section of the prayer (lines 103–105). These last three lines could well be 
set  in  quotation  marks.  This  phenomenon  is  attested  in  other  Mesopotamian 
prayers, too,7 but also in biblical laments of the individual. A striking example is

rituale. Mit einer Deutung der Novelle vom Armen Mann von Nippur,” BaghM 34 (2003), 181–203

Ps  22,  a  long  psalm  of  individual  lament,  in  which  the  section  of  complaint, 
mixed with petitions and expressions of confidence (Ps 22:2–22), is followed by 
elements of a thanksgiving psalm: a double promise of praise (Ps 22:23, 26) and 
its fulfillment (Ps 22:24–25, 27).8 This “mixture of genres” has been interpreted 
as indicating that the “true” genres and their Sitze im Leben were not valid any-
more at the time of writing; therefore, Ps 22 was considered “nachkultisch,” not 
as  prayer,  but  as  “Gebetsliteratur”  (prayer  literature).9  The  parallel  of  Ishtar 
2:101–105 makes it possible to understand Ps 22:23–27 as promise to praise and 
anticipated praise without necessitating the use of source criticism.10  

The history of use.11 The tablet BM 26187 (MS A) only contains Ishtar 2. Its 
colophon (lines 112–113 in Zgoll’s edition; line 111 gives the beginning of the 
prayer Ishtar 3) can be translated as follows: “A copy from Borsippa. According 
to its original. Nergal-balassu-iqbi, son of Atamar-KAL.ME, ritual expert (āšipu), 
has written (it) for his life, checked (it) through and permanently deposited (it) 
in Esagila.” 

This colophon contains information about the scribe and the use he made of 
this  particular  copy  of  the  prayer.  Nergal-balassu-iqbi,  the  scribe,  was  a  ritual 
expert (āšipu).12 He deposited the tablet in Esagila, the temple of Marduk in Bab-
ylon,  “for  his  life.”  Thus,  this  tablet  is  a  votive  offering  of  one  of  the  persons 
who  transmitted  and  executed  this  kind  of  ritual  and  was  never  meant  to  be 
used for the execution of the ritual written down on it with all of the practical 
instructions. The Sitz im Leben of the text inscribed on the tablet therefore is not 
identical with its use. The use has changed; in this special case, it is part of the 
“private piety” of a ritual expert. 

In  all  probability,  most  psalms  were  not  written  for  the  collection  of  the 
Book  of  Psalms,  but  independently,  and  were  collected  and  arranged  after-
wards—possibly also for “private piety” in the post-exilic period.13 The two stag-
es of usage of Ishtar 2 are an interesting parallel to the development of the con-
textualization of the Psalms.  
 
8  Ps 22:28–32 seem to be a later addition which enlarges the praising people in time and space;

Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1988), 112.

MARDUK: 

ӎӘ 

A Shuilla: Marduk 4 

ALAN LENZI 

Marduk was the local god of the city of Babylon. He eventually replaced En-
lil  as  the  chief  god  of  the  Mesopotamian  pantheon.  Although  he  had  many 
names,  Bēl,  “lord,”  best  conveys  Marduk’s  ultimate  position  in  Mesopotamian 
religious  thought.  Marduk’s  shrine  in  Babylon  was  called  É-sag-íl,  “the  house 
with uplifted head,” and his ziggurat was É-temen-an-ki, “house of the founda-
tion platform of heaven and the netherworld.” Zarpanitu was Marduk’s consort; 
Nabu was his son. 

There is some dispute about the etymology and meaning of Marduk’s name. 
The common logographic writing  dAMAR.UTU may represent Sumerian amar-utu-
a(k). (Whether this is a genuine Sumerian etymology or a folk etymology, that 
is,  an  indigenous  attempt  to  explain  an  incomprehensible  pre-Sumerian  name 
with  Sumerian,  is  a  matter  of  speculation  and  ultimately  moot.)  Some  have 
translated  amar-utu-a(k)  as  “calf  of  the  Sun  (god)”  (Lambert,  8)  and  others  as 
“calf of the storm” (Abusch, 543). In any case, the Sumerian etymology suggests 
the  early  name  of  the  deity  (i.e.,  in  the  OB  period)  was  Marūtuk  or  Marūtu, 
which  may  have  been  shortened  in  later  periods  to  Martuk  /  Marduk.  But  the 
lack of unambiguous syllabic spellings of the name (e.g.,  dma-ar- instead of the 
typical  dmar(u)-)1  sheds  some  doubt  on  the  existence  of  this  short  form  as  do 
Hebrew and Greek transliterations of the name in the biblical tradition (e.g., Jer 
50:2 MT:  ָדֹר ְמ; Jer 27:2 LXX: µαρωδαχ).2  

Although  Marduk  is  probably  attested  as  early  as  the  third  millennium  in 
texts from  Fara  (ancient  Shuruppak)  and  Abu  Salabikh,3  we  can  only  begin  to 
trace his veneration in the OB period. Originally, Marduk was a rather insignifi-
cant  local  god  from  the  city  of  Babylon,  perhaps  associated  with  justice  (so 
 
1  See Lambert, 7, who notes the increased use of CVCV signs in post-Kassite Akkadian and thus 
the ambiguity of writings with mar.  
2  Note also the spelling of the name in Ashurbanipal’s acrostic hymn to Marduk (ma-ru-du-uk). 
See Alasdair Livingstone, Court Poetry and Literary Miscellanea (SAA 3; Helsinki: Helsinki Univer-
sity Press, 1989), no. 2, rev. 1, 3, 6, and 8.

bert, 8.

Sommerfeld,  364),  thunderstorms  (so  Abusch,  544),  or  canal  digging  (so  Oshi-
ma). With the advent of Hammurabi in the early eighteenth century BCE and the 
meteoric rise of Babylon as a political and cultural power, Marduk was elevated 
to a position among the high gods of the pantheon. This is clearly evidenced by 
the  opening  lines  of  the  Code  of  Hammurabi  as  well  as  by  Marduk’s  growing 
popularity as the theophoric element in personal names.4 Although he was not 
made the head of the pantheon in the OB period, Marduk’s prominence was se-
cured at this time and his cult spread to several other cities. 

Marduk’s rise to the head of the pantheon is probably first officially recog-
nized during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I (1125–1104 BCE), who unified post-
Kassite  Babylonia  and  recovered  Marduk’s  statue  from  the  Elamites,  who  had 
carried  it  off  a  generation  earlier.5  Mythologically  speaking,  Marduk’s  rise  is 
recounted in the Enūma eliš, which may date to this period (though the dating of 
Enūma  eliš  continues  to  elicit  debate).  In  this  well-known  myth  the  gods  send 
Marduk to defeat the raging Tiamat and her minions. As a reward for this heroic 
exploit, the gods crown him king of the gods (see IV 28 and V 110). After Mar-
duk creates the cosmos and forms humanity, the gods build him a temple, Esagil, 
and a ziggurat, Etemenanki, in Babylon. The myth concludes with a long section 
in which the gods pronounce Marduk’s fifty names. The founding of Babylon in 
this myth was clearly intended to replace the former central sanctuary of Meso-
potamia,  Nippur,  the  seat  of  Enlil.  Giving  Marduk  fifty  names  was  a  piece  of 
theological revisionism  to  position  Marduk  as  the replacement  of  Enlil  (whose 
divine number was 50).6  

Throughout the first millennium, Marduk was honored as the chief god of 
the Mesopotamian pantheon, even recognized as such by the Assyrians in their 
royal  inscriptions.  This  prominence  was  celebrated  in  an  unparalleled  manner 
during the Neo-Babylonian empire and later employed politically by the Persians 
to  legitimize  their  conquest  of  Babylon  in  539  BCE  (see  The  Cyrus  Cylinder7). 
Although the cult of Marduk suffered a major set back when Alexander failed to 
rebuild  Marduk’s  destroyed  temple  complex,  Marduk  (Bel)  was  still revered  in 
the Hellenistic and Parthian periods. 
 
4  Sommerfeld has shown that the use of Marduk as a theophoric element in personal names sky-
rocketed between the early and late OB periods, so much so that he thinks it likely that nearly 
every family had a member bearing a name formed on Marduk (“Marduk,” 364). 
5  See W. G. Lambert, “The Reign of Nebuchadnezzar I: A Turning Point in the History of Ancient 
Mesopotamian  Religion,”  in  The  Seed  of  Wisdom:  Essays  in  Honour  of  T.  J.  Meeks  (ed.  Stewart 
McCullough; Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1964), 3–13. 
6  A similar attempt is probably attested in the god list AN = dAnum, where Marduk is given fifty 
names (some of which are different from those in Enūma eliš). See Richard L. Litke, A Reconstruc-
tion  of  the  Assyro-Babylonian  God-Lists,  AN  :  dan-nu-um  and  AN  :  anu  ša  amēli  (Texts  from the 
Babylonian Collection 3; New Haven: Yale Babylonian Collection, 1998), 89–95, esp. 89, note to 
185, and Lambert, 4.

Marduk was associated and then identified with a god named Asalluḫi (As-
arluḫi), a move that started in the early OB period and was completed by Kassite 
times.8 Since Asalluḫi was the son of Ea, god of wisdom and magic, this identifi-
cation  resulted  in  linking  Marduk  (and  therefore  Babylon)  to  the  ancient  and 
prestigious pantheon of Eridu, which gave  Marduk, who was previously an in-
significant deity, a legitimate place in the high levels of the Mesopotamian pan-
theon  and  bolstered  his  authority.9  It  is  no  accident  therefore  to  see  Marduk’s 
birth  to  Ea  (and  Damkina)  depicted  in  Enūma  eliš  I  79–108.10  We  know  that 
Marduk became an important god of magic and exorcism. What is not complete-
ly clear is whether this status suggested his eventual identification with Asalluḫi 
or whether it was the result of his association with Asalluḫi and/or Ea. For more 
about Asalluḫi, see page 403. 

In iconography Marduk was symbolized by a pointed spade and associated 

with a snake-dragon (mušḫuššu). Jupiter was his astrological representation. 

THE PRAYER:  

This prayer shows the three typical structural elements of a shuilla-prayer, 
hymnic introduction, petition, and concluding praise, but it implements these in 
an unusual manner, probably under the influence of ershaḫunga-prayers.  

The prayer opens with an unusually short invocation and hymnic introduc-
tion; in fact, its two lines form one of the shortest hymns attested among shuilla-
prayers.  

The petition section of the prayer is also unusual in size, accounting for all 
but  a  couple  of  the  text’s  remaining  lines  (3–27,  29–39).  This  section  divides 
into several  smaller units that may be characterized  successively as complaint, 
protest, and petition. An introductory complaint in lines 3–6 is followed by the 
supplicant’s  protestation  of  human  fallibility  and  ignorance  in  lines  8–15—an 
unusual theme for a shuilla but attested in ershaḫungas (see page 449).11 A sec-
ond  invocation  in  line  7  bridges  the  two  units.  A  unique  and  very  brief  self-
presentation formula (line 16a) stands at the head of the first section of petitions 
(lines 16b–27).  A second  section  of petitions, whose leitmotif is anticipated by 
line 19b, occurs in lines 29–39. This section consists of a seven-fold, repetitive 
litany in which the supplicant pleads for forgiveness of sin (lines 29–37) and a 
couplet in which the supplicant seeks the restoration of parent-like divine favor

11  See  Mayer’s  edition,  199,  who  notes  parallels  with  ershaḫungas  and  several  other  kinds  of 
prayers, including a “literary prayer” to Marduk, for which, see W. G. Lambert, “Three Literary 
Prayers of the Babylonians,” AfO 19 (1959/1960), 47–66, here 57:105–110. Translations of the 
latter are in Foster, 611–16, Seux, 172–81, von Soden, 270–72, and Hecker, TUAT II/5, 754–58.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

(lines 38–39). Both of these elements reflect  the concluding sections  of the er-
shaḫunga-prayers  (compare the  ending  of  the  prayer  at page  448,  n.5  and  see 
the  general  introduction,  page  46);  they  do  not  normally  occur  in  Akkadian 
shuillas.12  

Lines 28 and 40 bracket this second section of petitions and together form a 
disjointed promise of praise that concludes the prayer. This discontinuous con-
cluding  praise might  suggest that lines  29–39  are  a  secondary  insertion  in  the 
prayer.13  Given  the  manner  in  which  incantation-prayers  were  adjusted  and 
adapted for various purposes, this is not an implausible suggestion, but it is not 
currently supported by the evidence at hand (i.e., we do not have a MS lacking 
the litany). Rather than evidence for literary accretion, it seems more likely that 
the disjointed promise of praise points to the influence of another structural fea-
ture  of  the  ershaḫungas.  As  mentioned  in  the  general  introduction,  the  er-
shaḫunga-prayers may include a transitional statement that leads into the inter-
cessory litany; this transition may include praise to the deity. Given this and the 
affinities mentioned above, it is likely that the text of this prayer was influenced 
by typical features of both the shuilla- and ershaḫungas-prayers.  

Three elements frame the prayer: the invocation qarrādu Marduk, “O warri-
or Marduk,” in line 1 and line 40; the parental imagery in line 2 (abu) and lines 
38–39 (abi ālidīya, ummi ālittīya); and the contrasting imagery of the supplicant 
as an old man (šību) in line 6 and as a youth (ṣeḫērīya) in line 36. Two of these 
framing elements also appear in the middle of the text:  the parental / familial 
terms  appear  in  lines  22–23  and  the  supplicant’s  youth  mentioned  in  line  18. 
Furthermore, the qarrādu Marduk invocation occurs again at line 30. All of these 
features lend literary coherence to the prayer. 

The  three-fold  repetition  of  the  invocation  qarrādu  Marduk,  “O  warrior 
Marduk,” in lines 1, 30, and 40 may help bind this rather complex and atypical 
prayer into a unit. But Hunt (90–91) argues that this epithet may also shed light 
on the prayer’s literary development. Because he believes qarrādu is superfluous 
in the opening hymn (i.e., it has no parallel in line 2) and absent in a (supposed) 
citation of the prayer’s incipit in a letter from an exorcist (ABL 716 = SAA 18, 
no. 181, rev. 25), he suggests the epithet may have been inserted into line 1 to 
give unity to the prayer after the petitionary litany in lines 29–39 had been, in 
his  opinion,  added.  Although  this  is  an  interesting  idea,  the  evidence  is  not 
strong  enough  to  support  it.  First,  Hunt’s  poetic  understanding  of  lines  1–2  is 
open  to  question.  Qarrādu  may  not  have  a  parallel  term  in  line  2  but  neither 
does Marduk’s name; the parallelism between lines 1–2 lies in ša ezissu abūbu „ 
napšuršu abu rēmēnû. Since qarrādu Marduk was a commonly used phrase to de-
scribe Marduk (see CAD Q, 141), it may have been understood as a single epi-
thet here, whose lack of parallel in line 2 was intended to give the deity’s invo-
cation prominence in this first line of the prayer. Second, the assumed absence

of  the  word  qarrādu  in  the  citation  of  the  prayer’s  incipit  may  be  a  mistaken 
assumption.  Perhaps  the  writer  of  the  letter  who  cited  the  incipit  simply  left 
qarrādu out due to a memory lapse or because the word did not fit his rhetorical 
purpose. If one looks at the context of the letter, the writer is alluding to attrib-
utes  of  Marduk  to  flatter the king;  he  is  not  explicitly  citing  an  incipit  to  pre-
scribe a prayer. In fact, it may well be that he was not alluding to this prayer at 
all. Rather, he may have been simply using epithets of Marduk that also occur in 
our prayer to flatter the king. It is clear that our prayer has been influenced by 
features of ershaḫunga-prayers. But the evidence is still too slight and ambigu-
ous  to  posit  this  influence  occurred  after  the  initial  composition  of  the  prayer 
rather than at the time of it. 

The  prayer  turns  thematically  on  a  single  idea,  forgiveness  of  sins,  and 
therefore recalls the themes of the ershaḫunga- and dingirshadibba-prayers, both 
of  which  are  penitential  in  nature.14  Although  the  supplicant  confesses  sin  in 
lines 16–18 and 36, they also present three general reasons for sin—not to ex-
cuse their disobedience but to garner mercy and avert punishment. First, lines 8–
15, the protest section, depict humans as frail and ignorant, living and working 
under a divine economy that makes human sin practically inevitable. The prayer 
seems to ask implicitly, How could the supplicant not sin in such a world? Sec-
ond, the prayer mentions the issue of adolescent sins twice (lines 18 and 36). In 
these cases, the supplicant seems to request forbearance for immature mistakes. 
Finally, inherited sin or collective guilt finds a place in the prayer in lines 22–24. 
The  supplicant  does  not  plead  their  family’s  innocence  in  these  lines.  Rather, 
they wish to avert personal responsibility for the sins and ask that the sins’ ill 
effect go elsewhere. Throughout the long petitionary section of the prayer, one 
sees a supplicant striving to cover the gamut of reasons for culpability, includ-
ing, significantly, the mention of inadvertent sin in line 18b. Such broad cover-
age of possibilities is clearly due to the supplicant’s ignorance of a precise cause 
for the misfortune that has come their way, a common motif in Mesopotamian 
religious texts.15  

But  all  is  not  darkness  and  gloom.  There  is  reason  for  hope,  which  peeks 
through in line 40, in the very existence of the prayer itself: for if there was no 
hope for the supplicant to change the situation, there would be no reason to use 
the divinely-inspired shuilla. 

Two MSS preserve varying ritual instructions. Mayer’s MS A is followed here. 
MS  A also  preserves  a catchline to Marduk  9  (see Mayer, UFBG, 396) after our 
line 45 and before the tablet’s colophon.

is perceived as the effects of sin (i.e., sickness, social problems, etc.), including the human pro-
pensity for sin, adolescent sins, and unknown sins, see van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction, 94–97.

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of 
the prayer but is not a part of the prayer itself. It may have been read as Sumerian rather 
than Akkadian. The prayer opens with a very short hymnic introduction that invokes Mar-
duk with appropriate divine epithets. Qarrādu, “hero, warrior.” Qarrādu is a very common 
epithet for male deities (see CAD Q, 141–42).  dAMAR.UTU = Marduk. Ezēzu, “to be(come) 
angry, furious.” Ezissu is a 3ms predicative plus 3ms (resumptive) pronominal suffix, which 
literally means “his being angry,” that is, Marduk’s present state of rage. It is best rendered 
by “his anger.” The pronominal suffix resumes the relative pronoun ša at the head of the 
phrase (ša ezissu abūbu). Abūbu, “flood,” is often used metaphorically to characterize the 
inexorable power of a deity’s anger, a king’s military actions, or either’s weapons (see CAD 
A/1, 78–79).  
 
   
Line 2: Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled to, to forgive.” Abu, 
“father.”  Rēmēnû,  “merciful.”  (Gula  is  called  “merciful  [rēmēnû]  mother”  on  page  246.) 
Abu,  a  positive  image  here,  plays  on  the  negative  abūbu  in  line  1.  The  use  of  eziz  and 
napšur here at the beginning of the prayer recalls the second line in the opening hymn of 
Ludlul bēl nēmeqi (see page 486): eziz mūši muppašir urri, “he is angry at night but relenting 
at daybreak” (I 2). As mentioned by Hunt (89), it is significant that the merciful aspect of 
Marduk’s character lies closest to the petitionary part of the prayer that follows.  
 
   
Line 3: This line begins the complaint section of the prayer. Qabû, “to speak, to com-
mand, to decree.” Lā, “not,” is the particle used to negate individual substantives. Šemû,

“to  hear.”  The  infinitives  are  being  used  as  nouns  here  (more  specifically,  as  gerunds), 
“speaking and not hearing.” Ineffective speech, to speak an unheeded word, is a common 
Mesopotamian concern. When in the context of other humans, this anxiety may be related 
to a (perceived) loss of communal respect or self-esteem. In a context of divine communi-
cation, the supplicant expresses worries that his petitions are ignored. The heavens have 
become brass.  Dalāpu, “to keep someone awake, to  stir up, to  harrass.” The –dd– in  the 
verb is the result of an assimilation of the perfect’s infixed –t– to the first letter of the root. 
See also the verb in line 4. (One exemplar of the prayer inserts a still very fragmentary line 
between lines 3 and 4. All that is preserved is the word iššaknūni, “they are placed here for 
me.” See Mayer, 201.) 
 
   
Line 4: Šasû, “to shout, to call out.” Apālu, “to answer.” Dâṣu, “to treat with injustice, 
to treat with disrespect.” With perfect grammatical parallelism, line 4 restates line 3; se-
mantically speaking, however, the two lines bear witness to an intensifying of the anxiety. 
The  action  in  the  lines  moves  from  reception  of  the  spoken  word  (“hearing”)  to  active 
response (“answering”), precisely what the supplicant wants but is not getting. Moreover, 
the supplicant’s reaction moves from agitation to a feeling of disrespect. 
 
   
Line 5: Ammatu, literally, “forearm, cubit,” but seems to have a metaphorical mean-
ing  here  (and  only  here),  “strength”  (see  CAD  A/2,  70,  which  says  the  meaning  of  this 
passage is uncertain). Libbu, “heart, mind.” Šūṣû (Š of [w]aṣû), “to cause to go out, to ex-
pel.”  Given  the  odd  use  of  ammatu  and  its  phonological  similarities  to  amātu  (awātum), 
“word, matter,” one might well wonder if there is a double meaning to this line. The pri-
mary one is clear: the supplicant’s strength is sapped; the secondary one, reading the verb 
as a 1cs, is more subtle: the supplicant has revealed the secrets of his heart, presumably to 
the god. For amāta šūṣû, “to reveal a matter (i.e., secret),” see CAD A/2, 372–73. On this 
reading, line 5 is a sort of conceptual pivot point between lines 3–4 and line 6. 
 
   
Line 6: Kīma, “like.” Šību, “elder, old person.” Quddudu (D of qadādu), “to bend down, 
to  bow  low.”  Although  qadādu sometimes describes a  gesture of humility, the preceding 
line and the simile here (kīma šībi) require us to understand the verb in terms of degenera-
tion of the supplicant’s body. The chain of 3cs perfect verb forms continues into this line, 
the last of the complaint section. It is surely significant that three of the four verbs in the 
complaint section end with the –anni pronominal suffix. 
 
   
Line 7:  EN = bēlu, “lord.”  GAL = rabû (m), “great.”  DINGIR = ilu, “god.” Line 7 pro-
vides  a  transition  between  the  complaint  and  protest  sections  of  the  prayer.  This  line’s

vocative,  “O  great  lord  Marduk,”  is  unique  within  the  prayer  (compare lines 1,  30, and 
40); the attached epithet, “merciful god,” recalls line 2. The epithet Bēl(u) would eventual-
ly become Marduk’s primary name in Babylon. 
 
   
Line 8: Lines 8–15 form the supplicant’s protest, not of innocence but of human frail-
ty and the divine economy that makes human sin practically inevitable. Compare the simi-
lar ideas about human sinfulness in lines 132–134 of a dingirshadibba (see W. G. Lambert, 
“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” JNES 33 (1974), 280–83) and other examples cited by 
Hunt, 101–4 and Karel van der Toorn, “Theodicy in Akkadian Literature,” in Theodicy in 
the World of the Bible: The Goodness of God and the Problem of Evil (ed. Antti Laato and Jo-
hannes C. de Moor; Leiden: Brill, 2003), 62, 72–73. Human ignorance and tendency to sin 
is  not  used as an  excuse;  rather,  they  are  a  basis  for  the  supplicant’s  request  for  divine 
mercy  and  forgiveness.  Amēlūtu  (amīlūtu,  awīlūtum),  “humanity,  human  being,  people.” 
Mala, “as much as, as many as.” Šumu, “name.” Nabû, “to name.” Mala / ša šuma nabû, is 
an idiom for “everything, everyone” (see CAD N/1, 35 for other examples with amēlūtu). 
Foster’s  “by  whatever  name”  captures  the  sense  and  style  of  the  Akkadian  idiom  nicely 
(680). Nabât is fem. because amēlūtu is fem. Line 8 introduces by way of anacoluthon the 
referent of mannu, “who?,”  in the next several lines. 
 

amēlūtu mala šuma nabât 

anna ramānīša mannu ilammad 

 
Line 9: Annu (arnu), “guilt, fault, sin.” Ramānīša, “itself, its own”; the fem. pronomi-
nal suffix refers back to amēlūtu. Mannu, “who?” Lamādu, “to learn, to recognize, to under-
stand.” Lines 9–11 use rhetorical questions (note the use of mannu in each) to emphasize 
humanity’s ignorance with regard to their own sins. Prayers often express this idea with 
simple statements such as “I do not know my sin” or “my sin which I do not know but you 
know” (compare line 18 below). The point is clear: Mesopotamians almost always assumed 
some sin was behind the problems they experienced, even when they could not identify it 
(see similarly Mayer, 207). 
 
   
Line  10:  Lā,  “not,”  is  also  the  form  of  negation  used  after  interrogative  pronouns. 
Šêṭu, “to miss, to disdain, to be negligent.” Ayû (ajû, ayyu), “who?, which?, what?” Gullulu, 
“to commit a  sin.” Continuing  the  rhetorical questions, the line offers two  that are  both 
grammatically and semantically  parallel. These raise  the stakes laid out in lines 8–9 be-
cause not only is it difficult to know one’s own sins, everyone does it. Everyone sins. For 
similar statements in prayers, see the references in Seux, 170, n.10. 
 
   
Line 11: Although the second half of this line repeats the second half of line 9, the 
difference  encountered  in  the  first  halves  of  each  significantly  shifts  the  focus  from  the

human realm (line 9) to the divine (line 11). Alaktu, usually means “way, manner, course,” 
but  also  means  “divine  decree” in  some  contexts  (see  I.  Tzvi  Abusch,  “Alaktu  and  Hala-
khah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 [1987], 15–52). If the latter meaning 
is correct here, the supplicant may be complaining that the divine will is inscrutable. See 
similarly, e.g., the statement in Ludlul II 34–36 (see Amar Annus and Alan Lenzi, Ludlul bēl 
nēmeqi:  The  Standard  Babylonian  Poem  of  the  Righteous  Sufferer  (SAACT  7;  Helsinki:  The 
Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2010), xxi, with other references cited in n.35). 
 
   
Line 12: Itʾudu (Gt of naʾādu), “to watch carefully, to observe strictly.” Gullutu, “sin,” 
which is cognate to the verb in line 10. Rašû, “to acquire, to gain.” The 1cs precative may 
express  an  indirect  command  (“I  ought”)  here  (and  in  line  13)  rather  than  a  wish  (“let 
me”). One’s understanding of the context will determine one’s decision between the two. 
In the second half of the line, the  lā plus durative indicates a prohibitive (“I may not”). 
After painting the big picture of human ignorance, the prayer now focuses in on the indi-
vidual supplicant. The second half of the line presents the result of the supplicant’s actions 
in the first half. 
 
   
Line 13:  Ašru, “place,  location”; ašrātu (pl). Balāṭu,  “life, health, well-being.”  Šiteʾʾû 
(Gtn of šeʾû) means “to look all over, to search everywhere” but also “to be assiduous (in 
reverence) toward,” especially when used with something like  ašrāt  ili,  “sanctuaries of a 
god” (see CAD Š/2, 358–62).  
 
   
Line  14:  Arratu,  “curse.”  Ittabbulu  (Gtn  of  [w]abālu),  “to  look  after,  to  manage,  to 
direct, to be active.” The form is an inf. DINGIR.MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Qabât is a 3fs predicative 
from qabû, which here seems to mean something like “to command, to decree.” The fem. 
subject may go back to amēlūtu in line 8 or may simply refer to the general situation de-
scribed in the line (an impersonal “it”); in either case, the focus is pulled away from the 
supplicant and back onto a general, rather pessimistic view of humanity’s situation (lines 
8–11), as is clear from line 15, which shows why the sentiments of lines 12–13 are so diffi-
cult to implement in real life (see Mayer, 207).

Line  15:  Qātu,  “hand.”  LÚ  =  amēlu  (amīlu,  awīlum),  “human  being,  man.”  Qāt  DN, 
“the hand of [a god’s name],” is often used to denote illnesses and diseases (e.g., qāt Ištar). 
Here  the  word  may  explain  arratu  in  the  previous  line,  meaning  something  like  divine 
weight or affliction (see Foster, 681 for the latter option). Babālu, “to carry, to bring,” is a 
by-form of (w)abālu, the inf. of which was also used in the previous line (in the Gtn stem). 
 
   
Line  16:  The  self-presentation  formula  is  minimal.  ÌR  =  ardu  (wardum),  “servant.” 
Servant language is very common in Mesopotamian religious texts. The gods are conceived 
as divine kings. Humans are therefore their subjects. Anāku, “I.” This is the only instance 
of aradka preceding anāku in a self-presentation formula (see Mayer, UFBG, 49, n.8). Some 
MSS preserve the opposite, more typical order (see UFBG, 203, n.16(1)). There are at least 
three possible understandings of aradka anāku. The phrase may be understood as a nomi-
nal sentence, “I am your servant.” The two words may be in apposition to one another and 
rendered as an introduction to the line, “as for your servant, me.” (More idiomatic English 
requires rephrasing: “as for me, your servant.”) Finally, aradka may introduce the line, “as 
for your servant,” and anāku may emphasize the first person verb, “I myself, I actually.” 
One’s interpretive decision here and in the rest of the line will be based on one’s under-
standing  of  the  larger  context.  Šettūtu,  “sin.”  Lū  plus  preterite  may  express  concession, 
“even if, even though,” or affirmation, “indeed, verily” (see also line 17). Epēšu, “to do.” 
The prayer returns to focus on the supplicant, who confesses that they have in fact sinned.  

qāta ša ili ana amēli babālu 

aradka anāku šettūtu lū ēpuš 

itâ ša ili lū ētiq 

   
Line 17: Itû, “boundary, border.” Etēqu, “to cross over, to pass through.” Idiomatical-
ly, itâ etēqu means “to trespass, to transgress.” Line 17 provides a second, parallel confes-
sion of sin to that of line 16. 
 
   
Line 18: The restoration here follows Mayer, who also lists and discusses the variants 
in the other textual witnesses (203, n.18(1) and 209–10). The line opens with a subordi-
nate clause in which the ša functions substantively, “that which.” We expect the verb to 
conclude the clause, but in this poetic context the word order does not follow the norm. 
Meṣḫēriš, “in / during childhood, youth.” The supplicant refers back to possible sins com-
mitted earlier in his life. ZU = edû (idû), “to know.” NU = lā, “not.” Here the supplicant 
covers both known sins and those unknown to them—a common motif in Mesopotamian 
religious texts. The entire subordinate clause forms the object of the main verb, an impera-
tive. Mêšu,  “to  disregard, to  forgive.” We  expect the imperative of  mêšu  (mēš)  to appear 
without a final vowel. For other instances of the imperative with various final vowels, see 
CAD M/2, 42. This line forms the beginning of a long litany of petitions.

Line 19: Libbu, see line 5. Nakādu, literally, “to throb, to pound.” Ina libbīka nakādu 
may be understood metaphorically to mean “to worry, to be concerned about.” Paṭāru, “to 
loosen, to undo, to release.” Šērtu, “guilt, offence, punishment.” Pašāru, “to loosen, to un-
do, to release.” Both pašāru and paṭāru occur in contexts dealing with the forgiveness of 
sins/guilt or the release from sickness/demonic oppression (CAD P, 237–39 and 290–92). 
The second half of line 19 anticipates lines 29–35. Volitional forms, here a vetitive (a neg-
ative precative) and two imperatives, continue to dominate the text and will continue to 
do so for a number of lines  hence. Notice,  finally, the consonance and assonance in the 
second half of the line. 
 
    
Line 20: Lines 20 and 21 seem rather short and probably belong together in one poet-
ic  line.  Ešû,  “unclear,  confused,  uncertain.”  Ešâtīya  is  a  mp  verbal  adjective  with  a  1cs 
pronominal  suffix,  “my  confused  states  (of  mind)”  (similarly  dalḫâtīya  in  line  21).  Num-
muru  (D  of  namāru),  “to  brighten,  to  illuminate,  to  clarify,  to  clear  up.”  The  imperative 
requests a reversal of the supplicant’s state of mind (likewise in line 21). 
 
    
Line  21:  Dalḫu,  “troubled,  disturbed”  (when  used  of  water  the  word  means,  “mud-
died,” and of eyes, “blurred”). Zukkû (D of zakû), “to cleanse, to purify, to free.”  Lines 20 
and 21 show close grammatical and semantic parallelism. Significantly, ešâtu and dalḫâtu 
are also both used to describe ambiguous results of divination (“omens are confused”); see, 
e.g., CAD E, 378. 
 
    
Line  22:  AD  =  abu,  “father.”  MU  =  1cs  pronominal  suffix,  “my.”  AMA  =  ummu, 
“mother.” It is not uncommon for a prayer to add a reference to one’s brother and sister in 
such a list of relatives (see line 2 on page 136 for an example in this volume). In fact, three 
MSS  of  the  present  prayer  preserve  a  longer  list  that  includes  them  (see  Mayer,  203, 
n.22(5)). This line and the next form the compound subject of the vetitive in line 24, ayy-
iṭḫâ. The supplicant turns now to deal with sin that may have been inherited from family 
members.

Line  23:  Kimtu,  “family.”  Nišūtu,  “kin,  relatives.”  Salātu,  “family,  clan.”  The  list  of 
relatives continues from line 22 but now with collective terms rather than terms for indi-

vidual members. Notice how the 1cs pronominal suffixes on each noun in lines 22 and 23 
affect the phonological rhythm of the lines. 
 
    
Line 24:  Ana  ramānīya,  literally, “to my person, self.”  TE =  ṭeḫû, “to draw near,  to 
approach.”  The  phonetic  complement  on  the  logogram  (–a)  must  indicate  the  ventive. 
Aḫītam, “aside, elsewhere,” is an adverb of place. Alāku, “to go.” The two halves of the line 
are generally parallel in terms of grammar and semantics. Rather than the supplicant wish-
ing guilt (or its consequences) to be turned toward some other person (e.g., a foreigner or 
enemy, aḫû), the supplicant simply wishes it to go away, to go elsewhere (aḫītam alāku). 
 
    
Line 25: Mayer has collated the witnesses to this line and determined that the reading 
previous translators have used (iq-ṭa-ba-an-ni, deriving from King’s copy, BMS 11) is mis-
taken. He takes the first verb as a Š durative of ṭâbu, “to make good, to make favorable,” 
with the š changing to l before the dental, rather than taking it as a G perfect of qabû (see 
Mayer, 210–11). Due to the non-volitional form of the verb at its head (a durative), previ-
ous translators have usually understood the first half of the line as a subordinate clause, 
either conditional (assuming an understood šumma, “if”) or temporal (enūma, “when”). GIM 
=  kīma,  “like.”  Ú.KI.KAL  =  sassatu,  “grass.”  The  supplicant  wants  to  become  as  pure  as 
grass. Ubbubu (D of ebēbu), “to cleanse, to purify.” The form is a D impv. with a 1cs object 
suffix. Since the other volitional forms in the immediate context are directed to Marduk, it 
seems likely that the final verb in this line is, too. One might identify the god mentioned in 
the first half of the line as either Marduk or the supplicant’s personal god. The latter may 
seem more likely given the generic and personal manner of reference: ilī, “my god” (thus 
Mayer, 206). But one does not expect Marduk to wait on a personal god’s actions to act 
upon  the  supplicant’s  petition  (ubbibanni,  “purify  me”).  Moreover,  the  supplicant  asks 
Marduk to entrust them to the hands of the personal deities in the very next line. The sup-
plicant therefore does not seem to be in any position just yet to place hope in the actions 
of the personal god. Finally, one might wonder if the orthography for ilī, ì-lí = NI-NI, pre-
served in one MS (another reads DINGIR.MU), was intentionally used to differentiate between 
Marduk and the personal god,  who  is  referred to in the  next line with the more typical 
logogram  DINGIR.  (For  different  understandings  of  the  line,  see,  e.g.,  Hunt,  122–24  and 
Seux, 171, n.27.) 
 
    
Line 26: ŠU, see line 15. SIG5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f), “favorable, good.” IŠ8.DAR.MU 
=  ištarī,  “my  goddess.”  Šalmu,  “peace,  well-being.”  TI.LA  =  balāṭu,  “life,  health,  well-
being.”  Paqādu + ana, “to entrust, to hand over something to someone.” The supplicant 
continues to petition the deity for favor. In this case, he requests the deity to entrust them 
into  the  hands  of their  personal god  and  goddess.  It is  significant  that  the text  specifies 
“the favorable hands”  of the deities. The working assumption in the  prayer may  be that

the supplicant was not on the best of terms with the personal deities. They now ask Mar-
duk to set that relationship aright. The imagery of the “hand of a god” here and in line 15 
presents a significant contrast. 
 
    
Line  27:  Ikribū,  “prayers,  votive  offerings”  (for  a  discussion  of  the  nuances  of  this 
term, see CAD I/J, 66). Teslītū, “petitions, requests.” Tēmēqū (tēmīqū), “deep prayers, well-
conceived presentations of a case” (see CAD T, 335). Dāriš, “forever.” Izuzzu, “to stand, to 
serve,”  has  here  a  dative  2ms  pronominal  suffix,  “to,  for  you.”  Having  addressed  their 
position with regard to their personal deities, the supplicant now attends to their relation-
ship to Marduk. They wish to stand before him in perpetual supplication. Standing before 
another is a sign of one’s subservience. This fits the relationship between deity and suppli-
cant perfectly (see line 16, aradka). Perpetual supplication may seem obsequious, but one 
might also consider this wish from another standpoint: uninterrupted access. To have con-
stant  communicative  access  with  the  deity  would  be  a  great  privilege  and  a  means  for 
insuring one’s security. Contrast this desire with the problem mentioned in line 3. 
 
    
Line 28: Nišū (f), “people, populace.” Dešû, “abundant, numerous.” The precise syn-
tactical function of KUR = mātu, “country, land,” and the relative clause that it governs is 
unclear. It may be in apposition to nišū dešâtu, “abundant people,” at the head of the line. 
It may modify nišū dešâtu somehow: “the abundant people (living in, of, from) the land. . .” 
(see CAD D, 129  and Š/1, 148).  Or,  it may  functional adverbially, specifying where  the 
people offer their praise: “let the abundant people praise you (in) the land. . . .” Ašru, see 
line  13.  Šakānu,  “to  put,  to  establish,  to  set  up.”  The  nuanced  meaning  of  the  relative 
phrase ša ina ašri šaknat, literally, “which is set in (its) place,” is also unclear (see Mayer, 
211). The CAD suggests “which is well organized” (D, 129 and N/1, 102) or “which is well 
established” (Š/1, 148). AHw suggests “which lies on the earth” (83, see likewise, Hunt, 
127–28), but understanding ašru as “earth” is unique. Nâdu, “to praise.” The final verb is 
actually the first word in line 29, but it only makes sense if it is considered a part of line 
28. The supplicant now broadens their view and wishes that a large body of people will 
also honor Marduk with their praise. The implication is that the people will see what Mar-
duk has done for the supplicant and join in their thanksgiving. The same idea is presented 
explicitly and more fully in Ludlul IV 69–82 (according to the line numbers of SAACT 7). 
This line seems to lead naturally into line 40, the final line of the prayer.  
 
    
Line 29: This line begins a seven-fold petition for forgiveness of sin. The supplicant 
begins  here  with  a  general  request,  presumably  directed  to  Marduk.  All  of  the  ones  to 
follow will be directed to a specifically invoked deity. It may be surprising to see the issue

of forgiveness resurface after the wish for widespread praise of the deity in line 28. But the 
prayer seems to be under the influence of the ershaḫunga’s form (see the introduction to 
this prayer). For annu, paṭāru, and pašāru, see lines 9 and 19. Annu is  consistently written 
with the 1cs pronominal suffix in the following lines. 
 
    
Line 30: UR.SAG = qarrādu. See line 1 for this epithet. Although the prayer is already 
directed to Marduk, the supplicant re-invokes Marduk, echoing the opening words of the 
prayer, and asks him to forgive their sins. This line seems redundant after line 29.

Line 33: Tašmētum, consort of Nabu. The litany appeals to the first god of the panthe-
on and his spouse in lines 30–31 and then the next ranking divine pair, Nabu and Tash-
metu, in lines 32–33.   
 
    
Line 34: dU.GUR = Nergal (one MS writes Nergal’s name dGÌR.UNU.GAL), an underworld 
deity associated  with plague and  disaster (see page 339).  He  is  probably used here as a 
contrast to the heavenly gods invoked in the next line (Hunt, 133). 
 
    
Line 35: Ašābu (wašābum), “to sit, to dwell.” dAnum is literally “(the god) Anu,” who 
stands for the cosmic realm of “heaven” here. The litany broadens its view to all the celes-
tial deities.

Line 36: Ša introduces a relative clause that modifies anna rabâ. Ultu, often for ištu, 
“from, out of; since, after, when.” Ūmu, “day.” Ṣeḫēru, “to be(come) small, little,” but as an 
infinitive,  “to  be  young,  to  be  a  minor”  (see  CAD  Ṣ,  122).  The  pronominal  suffix  is  the 
subject of the infinitive, literally, “my being a minor.” A substantive would provide a bet-
ter  idiomatic  rendering.  Epēšu,  “to  do,  to  make.”  Here  īpušu  stands  for  ēpušu  (1cs).  The 
final –u is the subjunctive marker, indicating that the verb only functions within the rela-
tive clause; it is not the main verb of the sentence. The entire line forms the object of the 
verbs in line 37. The supplicant now treats the accumulation of all of their sins since their 
youth as one large, collective sin. In so doing, it recalls line 18. 
 
    
Line 37: Suppuḫu (D of sapāḫu), “scatter, disperse.” EN = adi, “up to, until, as far as.” 
7-šu = sebîšu, “seven times, sevenfold.” A seven-fold dispersal, paralleling the seven-fold 
call for forgiveness in lines 29–35, indicates the desire for total forgiveness of all accumu-
lated sin. The supplicant wants a fresh start, a clean slate. 
 
    
Line 38: Alādu (walādum), “to give birth to” (female subject), “to engender, to beget” 
(male subject). The pronominal suffix on the participle (here and in the next line, accord-
ing to Mayer’s  MS  A) is the object  of the verbal action. Libbaka  is  the object  of the sen-
tence’s main verb at the end of line 39. The parental simile here and in the next line re-
calls the use of abu in line 2.  
 
libbaka kīma abi ālidīya 
    
Line 39: Ālittu is a fs participle from alādu. The third root letter d, a dental, has assim-
ilated to the t of the feminine marker. Ašrīšu is ašru plus a 3ms pronominal suffix. Târu, “to 
return, to turn back”; but târu with ašru means “to return to normal” (see CAD T, 255). 
Marduk  has  been  angry;  his  heart  has  been  exercised.  The  supplicant  asks  that  Marduk 
now return to normal (i.e., relent from his anger), which the supplicant defines in terms of 
the affection of human parents. 
 
    
Line 40: The same invocation used in lines 1 and 30 is repeated here in the otherwise 
formulaic  promise  of  praise.  Bulluṭu,  “to  restore  to  health,  to  revive.”  Dalīlū,  “praises.” 
Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and 
its object both  come  from the same root.  Translate idiomatically, “let  me proclaim  your 
praises” or the like.

Line 41: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the 
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the kind of prayer on the tablet and to 
whom it is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, 
“it is the wording of a lifted-hand to Marduk.” 
   
Line 42: KÌD.KÌD.BI = kik(k)iṭṭûšu, “its ritual.” One MS preserves a common alternative: 
DÙ.DÙ.BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” The ritual follows Mayer’s MS A. A variation of this ritual 
exists in his MS d. KÌD.KÌD.BI (or DÙ.DÙ.BI) alerts the user of the tablet that the ritual instruc-
tions follow. Compare the ÉN at the beginning of the prayer. All of the items included in 
the following are common elements of Mesopotamian ritual. IGI = pānu, “face,” or maḫru, 
“front”; both are  possible.  Ana pāni,  maḫri means “to the  face  of, in  front of.”  NÍG.NA  = 
nignakku, “incense  burner.” (GIŠ.)ŠIM.LI = burāšu,  “juniper”  (pieces of wood or  its resin). 
The juniper is the material to be burnt in the incense burner. GAR = šakānu, “to set up, to 
erect.” 
 
   
Line 43: GI.DU8 = paṭīru, “portable altar.” GIN = kunnu (D of kânu), “to set up.” NIN-
DA.Ì.DÉ.A  =  mersu, “mersu-cake”  (made of  dates, sesame, and  oil).  LÀL =  dišpu, “honey.” 
Ì.NUN.NÀ = ḫimētu, “ghee, butter.” 
paṭīra tukān mersa dišpa ḫimēta tašakkan 
 
   
Line 44: KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” SAG = rēštû, “first, pre-eminent.” Šikaru rēštû designates 
first-rate beer, a very common item to libate  (see CAD  Š/2,  426).  BAL =  naqû, “to  pour 
out,  to  libate,  to  sacrifice.”  NUMUN  =  zēru,  “seed.”  Ú.IN.NU.UŠ  =  maštakal,  “(an  alkaline 
plant).” ŠÀ = libbu means “heart” but “into, toward” when preceded by ana. Ì.GIŠ = šamnu, 
“oil.” ŠUB = nadû, “to throw down, to lay down.”  
 
   
manû, “to recite, to count.” ŠÉŠ = pašāšu, “to smear, to anoint.” 
 

Line 45: ŠID = minûtu, “recitation,” a cognate accusative to the following verb: ŠID = 

kik(k)iṭṭûšu: ana pāni Marduk nignakka burāša tašakkan 

šikara rēštâ tanaqqi zēr maštakal ana libbi šamni tanaddi 

ana pāni Marduk tašakkan minûta tamannū-ma šamna tapaššaš

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

There  are  many  items  in  this  prayer  that  we  could  discuss  comparatively 

 
with the Hebrew Bible, but space only permits a few suggestions.1 

Lines  2  and  38  of  our  prayer  compare  Marduk  to  a  father  (abu).2  Several 
texts in the Hebrew Bible also imagine Yahweh  as a father (ב ָא): to Israel as a 
people (e.g., Deut 32:6, Isa 63:16, 64:7, Jer 3:19, 31:9, Mal 2:10, and 3:17), to 
their king (e.g., 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 89:7, and compare Ps 2:7, in which Yahweh 
says, “you are my son, today I have fathered you” [י ִתּ ְד ִל ְי, cognate to Akk. alādu 
in lines  38–39]), and to individuals within Israel  (e.g., Prov 3:12). Although it 
provides  another  example  of  Yahweh  as  father  to  the  individual,  Ps  103:13  is 
particularly striking in its similarities to the sentiments of abu rēmēnû, “merciful 
father,”  in  line  2  of  our  prayer:  וי ָא ֵר ְי־ל ַ  ה ָוֹהְי  ם ַח ִר  םי ִנ ָבּ־ל ַ  ב ָא  ם ֵח ַר ְכּ,  “as  a  father 
shows mercy (ם ֵח ַר, D inf., cognate to Akk. rēmēnû) to (his) children, (so) Yahweh 
shows mercy to those who fear him.” The comparable use of parental or fatherly 
imagery  for  a  deity  in  Israel  and  Mesopotamia  should  not  be  understood  in 
terms of cultural diffusion or borrowing. Rather, the use of parental imagery is 
rooted  in  an  anthropomorphizing  model  of  deity  that  clarifies  certain  divine 
attributes via analogy with a common, basic social reality: loving parents. 

A rhetorical question in lines 8–9 of our prayer broaches the topic of human 
ignorance of sin  (see also line 18), a  common motif in Mesopotian prayer.3 Ps 
19:13 contains a very similar idea in the form of a rhetorical question:  י ִמ תוֹאי ִג ְשׁ
י ִנ ֵקּ ַנ תוֹר ָתּ ְס ִנּ ִמ ןי ִב ָי, “Who can discern (one’s) errors? Acquit me of hidden sins” (con-
trast Ps 51:5, where the supplicant is quite aware of his failing).4 Although the 
question in this verse is almost identical to what we see in line 9 of our prayer, 
the biblical petition does not have the same tone as the petitions of the Akkadi-
an  prayer.  Rather,  in  the  psalm  the  measure  for  understanding  the  depths  of 
one’s failings as well as the means to achieve obedience are revealed in the Torah 
(vv. 8–12). The petition in v. 13 and those in vv. 14–15, therefore, seem to be 
uttered by  a supplicant  confident  about  the  deity’s  will  and  requirements; this 
 
1  Many  broad  thematic  studies  could  be  suggested.  For  example,  Marduk’s  epithet  qarrādu, 
“warrior,” suggests a comparison with the Hebrew Bible’s depiction of Yahweh as divine warrior. 
The  penitential  theme  of  the  entire  prayer  suggests  a  comparison  with  the  Penitential  Psalms 
(Pss 6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143), among others. And the sentiments expressed in lines 11–15 of 
our prayer represent a rather pessimistic view on divine–human relations, bringing to mind for 
different reasons both the primeval curse on the original humans in Gen 3 and the grim outlook 
on everyday life expressed in Qoh 1:13–15. As interesting as they are, these topics are too large 
and involved to consider here. 
2  Contrast line 39, where Marduk is compared to a mother.  
3  Line 10 changes the subject significantly, asking rhetorically if there is anyone without sin. The 
question  and  implied  answer  are  not  so  much  an  excuse  for  sin  as  a  basis  for  mercy.  See  Ps 
130:3, which asks a similar rhetorical question for the same purpose. See also, e.g., 1 Kgs 8:46, 
for the idea that no one is without sin in a context dealing with supplication. 
4  See also Ps 90:8 for another psalm that mentions secret sins. For a brief discussion of secret sin, 
the human propensity for sin, and adolescent sins in the Hebrew Bible, see van der Toorn, Sin 
and Sanction, 97–99.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

stands in contrast to what line 11 in our Akkadian prayer suggests. This interpre-
tation is supported by the epithets the psalmist uses in v. 15 for the deity:  י ִרוּצ
י ִל ֲאֹג ְו, “my rock and my redeemer.” But seeing this confidence in Ps 19 is not to 
suggest that such an attitude was pervasive throughout all of Israel at all times. 
In fact, the stress and anxiety one reads in the biblical laments of the individual 
suggest that supplicants often were uncertain about the reasons for their prob-
lems—much like our Akkadian-speaking supplicant. 

 

רוֹב ֲַי

 אֹ ל ְו  ָתי ִשׂ ָ וי ָקּ ֻח

The phrase itâ etēqu, used in line 17, literally means “to cross a boundary” 
but  may  also  have  a  more  ethically-charged  meaning  in  some  contexts,  “to 
transgress.” A similar semantic range exists  in the use  of the BH root  רבע. For 
example,  in  Job  14:6  רבע  with  קֹח  as its  object means  “to cross  a  boundary  or 
limit”: 
, “you have made his limits that he cannot cross.” But 
other objects may be used with the verb to bring out the ethical idea more ex-
plicitly and to identify what one has transgressed (as is sometimes the case with 
Akkadian etēqu, see CAD  E, 389).  Thus, for example, one may illicitly cross or 
transgress a commandment (ה ָו ְצ ִמ, e.g., Deut 26:13, 2 Chron 24:20, and Esth 3:3 
[of a human king]), a covenant (תי ִר ְבּ, e.g., Deut 17:2, Judg 2:20, Josh 7: 11, 15, 
23:16,  and  Jer  34:18),  divine  instruction(s)  (
,  e.g.,  Dan  9:11,  Isa 
24:5), or the word of Yahweh (ה ָוֹהְי י ִפּ, e.g., Num 14:41, 22:18, 1 Sam 15:24, Prov 
8:29 [וי ִפ]). Given the fact that Israel is often addressed in the Bible as a group, it 
should be no surprise that many of the biblical references talk about collective 
transgression (but see Esth 3:3).

A Shuilla: Marduk 2 

KYLE GREENWOOD 

 

MARDUK:  

See page 291. 

THE PRAYER:1 

 
Like other shuilla-prayers, this prayer to Marduk consists of an introductory 
hymn (lines 1–9), a petition (lines 12–20 [13–21]), and a benediction (lines 21–
25 [25–27]).2 The prayer concludes with a ritual formula. Abusch has outlined 
the structure of the entire prayer as follows: 

 
 
 
 
 

I. Introductory Hymn (1–9)  
  A. Capsule Shuilla (10–11) [10–12] 
II. Prayer for Success (12–20) [13–21] 
  Aʹ. Capsule Shuilla (21–22) [22–24] 
III. Concluding Benediction (23–25) [25–27] 

Unlike other shuilla-prayers, this prayer has two summary statements, one im-
mediately preceding the petition and one immediately following the petition. 
 
 
If the prayer were indeed chiastic in structure, one would expect the central 
literary unit to display some of the characteristics of the entire unit. In fact, this 
is very much the case. One can readily appreciate the prayer’s grammatical so-
phistication.

this prayer. For a more detailed presentation, the reader is directed to that study.

Not only is there balance in the verbal forms, but there is concentric movement 
in the person of the verbal forms: 1–2–3–3–3–3–2–1.3 Furthermore, this balance 
is evident in the themes: success „ acceptance; mouth, mind „ speak, hear, obey; 
courtier and attendant „ protective god; god „ goddess. Within the framework of 
the petition, the supplicant requests success and protection, which come hand-
in-hand. In order to receive protection from his personal deities, the supplicant 
must be successful in his moral and religious obligations. 
 
Two  summary statements  (lines  10–11  [10–12],  21–22  [22–24])  flank  the 
petition section. The inclusion of the summary statements is a deviation from the 
standard  shuilla-prayer  structure.  However,  they  serve  two  important  literary 
functions. First, as  Abusch notes, these summaries or “capsules” consist of two 
parallel sections with shared vocabulary and forms.

Prayer for Life:

In each case, the capsule both introduces and is distinct from the prayer section 
that immediately follows. Moreover, each capsule is constructed along the norms 
of  a  regular  shuilla-prayer:  hymn  (invocation),  petition,  benediction.  Second, 
since they are parallel with each other, these capsules broaden the chiastic struc-
ture displayed in the petition section. 
 
At the outermost edges of the chiasm are the introductory hymn and bene-
diction.  The  hymnic  introduction,  lines  1–9,  consists  of  three  stanzas  of  three 
lines each.  According to Abusch, “the first stanza emphasized city and temple; 
the second, temple and human life; the third stanza serves both to broaden Mar-
duk’s  focus  of  concern  and  action  as  well  as  to  bring  together  again  locality, 
temple,  and human community—but this  time on a higher level of generaliza-
tion” (8). This introduction functions to convey Marduk’s expansion from local 
deity and divine offspring to universal and supreme god. The benediction recalls 
the main theme addressed in the introductory hymn. Marduk is a universal deity 
with historical connections to the great gods of Eridu.  
 
The overall effect of the structure is to create a literary version of a presen-
tation  scene,  a  glyptic  motif  commonly  seen  on  Mesopotamian  cylinder  seals. 
The supplicant prepares to meet Marduk in the center of the petition section. He 
then  meets  Marduk  in  the  two  capsules,  at  which  point  he  would  present  his

offerings. Finally, in the outer bands of the prayer, he praises the deity as one 
worthy of his offerings. 
 
 As  is  the  case  with  other  incantation-prayers  in  this  volume,  this  shuilla 
was utilized in lustration rituals. The king would recite this and other incanta-
tions as part of the royal ceremonies of Bīt mēseri, “House of Detention,” and Bīt 
rimki, “House of Ablution,” in the hope of counteracting the evil effects wrought 
by impurity, thereby restoring his health. 
The  textual  tradition  for  Marduk  2  is  extensive.4  The  benefits  of  such  a 
 
broad  corpus  are  invaluable.  Of  course,  this  leads  to  certain  inconsistencies 
among the  MSS. In addition to the expected textual variants, some  MSS lack the 
formulaic conclusion. Furthermore, there are some discrepancies in line number-
ing. For the purposes of this volume and due to the fact that an up-to-date edi-
tion that utilizes all of the MSS is lacking, this treatment follows Ebeling’s edition, 
which is based on KAR 59. Other MSS will be used only selectively to fill its gaps 
or to provide better readings.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word only marks the point at 
which the prayer begins; it is not part of the prayer itself. The prayer begins with a series 
of  epithets.  Gašru,  “strong,  powerful,  outstanding,”  and  šūpû,  “splendid,  famous,  great, 
brilliant,” are both ms adjectives modifying etellu, “pre-eminent one, prince, lord.” ERI.DU10 
is the Sumerian rendering of Eridu, a city in Southern Babylonia. According to the Sumeri-
an King List and the so-called Eridu Genesis, the office of kingship descended from heaven 
and was first established at Eridu.

Line  2:  NUN  =  rubû,  “prince,”  is  a  common epithet in  royal  inscriptions  (see M.  J. 
Seux, Épithètes royales akkadiennes et sumériennes [Paris: Letouzey et ANÉ, 1967], 251–56). 
Tizqāru (tizqaru), “supreme, exalted, prominent.” Bukru, “son, offspring.” Nudimmud is an 
epithet for the god better known as Enki in Sumerian and Ea in Akkadian (see page 227). 
In the Eridu Genesis (also known as the Ziusudra Epic), Nudimmud was appointed as the 
patron deity of Eridu. The phrase bukur Nudimmud recalls the mythologies in which Mar-
duk is identified as the son of Nudimmud. Thus, lines 1–2 invoke the memory of Marduk’s 
historical significance in the Babylonian pantheon. 
 

rubû tizqāru bukur Nudimmud 

   
Line  3:  dAMAR.UTU,  “bull-calf  of  the  sun/storm,”  is  one  of  several  designations  for 
Marduk  (see  page  291).  The  adjective  šalbābu,  “wise” is a  common  epithet  for  Marduk. 
Ruššu  (D  of  râšu),  “to  give  cause  for  rejoicing,  celebration.”  This  participle  presumably 
refers to the anonymous worshippers of Marduk at É-engur-ra. This temple, whose Sumeri-
an  name  means  “House  of  the  Sweet  Waters,”  is  not  attested  elsewhere  as  a  temple  of 
Marduk. However, it is known to be the name for temples of Inana and Nanshe, as well as 
a dais for Ea at E-sagil (see A. R. George, House Most High: The Temples of Ancient Mesopo-
tamia [Mesopotamian Civilizations  5; Winona Lake:  Eisenbrauns, 1993], #248).  The five 
participles in lines 3–7 are used substantively as epithets of the deity. 
 

Marduk šalbābu murīš E-engura 

bēl E-sagil tukulti Bābili 

   
Line  4:  EN  =  bēlu,  “lord.”  É-sag-íl,  “House  Whose  Top  is  High,”  was  the  Sumerian 
name  of  Marduk’s  temple  in  Babylon  (George,  House  Most  High,  #967).  Tukultu,  “trust, 
object of trust, support.” KÁ.DINGIR.RAki = Bābili, “Babylon.” There are other orthographies 
attested for the name of Babylon in the various MSS, e.g., Eki and báb-ì-lí. 
 
   
Line 5: Râmu, “to love.” É-zi-da, which means “True House” in Sumerian, was known 
primarily as a temple for Nabu, but Marduk was venerated periodically at a temple by this 
name in Borsippa (George, House Most High, #1236). Šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to preserve, 
to keep well.” Napištu and balāṭu (see line 6) are parallel terms meaning “life.” Taking line 
21 into consideration, balāṭu has been translated as “health” in an effort to remain faithful 
to the Akkadian nuances. 
 
   
Line 6:  Ašarēdu  (ašaridu),  “foremost,  prominent.”  TI.LA  =  balāṭu,  “life,  health.”  The 
phrase mudeššû balāṭi does not translate smoothly. The D stem participle of dešû, “to be or

become abundant,” denotes causation of abundance. In terms of one’s life or well-being, 
the English verb “invigorate” provides a close approximation to the original intent. É-maḫ-
ti-la  was  the  Sumerian  name  of  Marduk’s  throne  in  E-sagil  (George,  House  Most  High, 
#735).  Most  MSS  preserve  a  Sumerian  word  play  in  lines  5–6  between  the  name  of  the 
temple in the first stichos and Marduk’s relationship to humanity in the second. Thus, é-zi-
da . . . ZI-ti „ é-mah-ti-la . . . TI.LA (see Abusch, 6).  
 
   
Line 7: Ṣulūlu, “roof, protection.” Gamālu, “to do a favor, to be kind to, to spare, to 
save.” UN = nišū, “people.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “broad, expansive, wide.” Nišī 
rapšāti literally means, “an extensive people,” connoting that the people are vast in num-
ber and widespread in geography. Nišū is a feminine noun, hence the feminine ending on 
the adjective. 
 
   
Line 8: UŠUMGAL (= ušumgallu) is composed of the two signs GAL-UŠUM. Its primary 
definition is “great dragon,” or “great serpent.” This word was a royal and divine epithet, 
meaning “omnipotent, sovereign.” Kališ, “all, everywhere.” BARAG is a Sumerian word that 
comes into Akkadian as parakku, meaning “dais, sanctuary, chapel.”

ṣulūl māti gāmil nišī rapšāti 

ušumgal kališ parakkī 

šumka kališ ina pī nišī ṭāb 

 
Line 9: In the ancient world šumu, “name,” entailed the identity of the one possessing 
the name. The ability to speak the deity’s name gave the supplicant an element of control 
over that deity. The supplicant is confessing to Marduk that those who know the deity’s 
name are properly handling that name. Ina pī literally means “in the mouth of,” but the 
idiom works best in English as “on the lips of.”  Ṭâbu, “to be(come) good, sweet, favora-
ble.” The form here is a G 3ms predicative. 
 
   
Line 10: Rēmēnû, “merciful.” Capsule A of lines 10–11, with its renewed invocation 
(see line 3), forms a transition between the opening hymn and the petition section of the 
prayer.  
 
   
Line  11:  Line  11  contains  three  consecutive  1cs  precatives,  as  indicated  by  the  lu– 
preformative, rather than li– (see also the end of line 12). Kīnu (m), kittu (f), “true, just, 
correct,  steadfast.”  MSS  vary  with  regard  to this adj.  Variants include  kabitti,  “heavy,  se-
vere,  weighty,”  and  ṣīrti,  “exalted,  supreme,  august.”  Luštammar  is  in  the  Gt  stem,  from 
šamāru,  “to  extol,  praise.”  Note  the  abstract  ending  (–ūt)  on  ilu,  rendering  the  noun  as

“divinity” or “god-ness.” Recall that clauses joined by –ma are logically connected. Since 
lušlim-ma is followed by another injunctive form, we should understand luštammar ilūtka as 
a resultative clause. 
 
   
Line 12: The particle ēma, “whatever,” introduces a dependent clause, which is con-
cluded by uṣammaru, a  1cs durative of ṣummuru (D  of  ṣamāru), “to  strive  for, to aim,  to 
plan.” The –u suffix is the subjunctive marker. Kašādu, “to reach, to achieve.” In military 
contexts, the verb implies victory; that is, the army reaches its goal. 
 
   
Line 13: Šakānu, “to put, to place, to establish.” Kittu, “truth, justice, steadfastness,” is 
a noun and should be distinguished semantically from the homonym, a fem. adj., in line 
12. “Place truth” is a common way of speaking about one’s desire for a god to establish the 
right thing  in a  particular situation. Here  the supplicant  wants Marduk to give the right 
words to say so they can find the social success that they presently lack. Having received 
this truth, the supplicant may be better positioned for successful intercession. 
 
   
Line 14: Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to cause to be, to create.” INIM = amātu (awātum), “word, 
matter.”  SIG5 =  damqu (m), damiqtu (f), “good, favorable.” Note the parallel structure of 
lines 13 and 14: imperative, noun, prepositional phrase. 
 
   
Line  15:  Tīru  and  nanzāzu  are  interchangeable  terms  referring  to  people  of  social 
prominence,  “courtier,  attendant.”  Qabû,  “to  speak,  to  utter,  to  pronounce,  to  report.” 
Damiqtu,  “favor,  goodwill,  goodness,”  is  a  noun  and  should  be  distinguished  from  the 
homonym, a fem. adj., in line 14. Damiqta qabû literally means “to speak good will, favor,” 
but  may  be  translated idiomatically  as  “to  intercede”  (see  CAD  D,  64).  The  supplicant’s 
desire  is that the divinely placed  “good word”  will be received by the social elites, who 
will then intercede on his behalf.  
 
   
Line 16: MU is a logogram for the 1cs pronominal suffix. One should read it as –ī in 
lines 16 and 17 since the nouns are in the nominative case. By contrast, note the –ya suffix 
on imnu, “right,” and šumēlu, “left” (see line 17), both of which are in the genitive case. 
Izuzzu/uzuzzu, “to stand.” For a detailed study of this verb, see J. Huehnergard, “Izuzzum 
and  Itūlum,”  in  Riches  Hidden  in  Secret  Places:  Ancient  Near  Eastern  Studies  in  Memory  of 
Thorkild Jacobsen (ed. Tzvi Abusch; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2002), 161–85. Lines 16–

17 introduce a significant feature of ancient Near Eastern religion. The common person did 
not  have  access  to  the  great  royal  temples.  Thus,  individuals  sought  a  personal  god  or 
goddess.  The  term  “to  acquire  a  god”  (Akk.  ila  rašû;  Sum.  lú-dingir  tuk)  is  synonymous 
with what we would call luck or fortune (CAD I/J, 101). Since misfortune, such as illness 
or disease, was thought to have derived from demons, the personal deities, standing on the 
right and left, may have served an apotropaic function, thus ensuring good luck. For more 
on the personal deities, see page 431. 
 

ilī lizziz ina imnīya  

Line 17: The divine number for Ishtar is 15. In this case, 15 = ištaru, used generically 

to refer to the supplicant’s personal goddess. GÙB = šumēlu, “left side.” 
 

ištarī lizziz ina šumēlīya  

Line 18: Šullumu (D of šalāmu), see line 5. The participle mušallimu functions as an at-
tributive adjective modifying ilu. Kayyān, “constantly, regularly.” Lū, “let (it) be.” Á = idu, 
“arm, side, strength.” 
 

ilu mušallimu ina idīya lū kayyān  

Line 19: Šurkam-ma is a G impv. from the root šarāku, “to grant” with ventive (–am) 
and  enclitic  –ma.  The  impv.  precedes  three  infinitives  in  the  accusative  case  serving  as 
direct objects of the finite verb. Šemû, “to hear.” Magāru, “to follow an order, to obey” (see 
CAD  M/I, 34).  There is some discrepancy in the exemplars on the final sign of  the line. 
KAR 59 reads RI, while other MSS read RU or RA. Following King and Meier, the accusative 
reading has been adopted here. 
 

šurkam-ma qabâ šemâ u magāra  

Line 20: Aqabbû is a 1 cs G present with the subjunctive –u. GIM = kīma, “as, like.” 
Because amāt is in the bound form, its syntactical function is to introduce the dependent 
clause. The 3fs form of the predicative, magrat, is used for agreement with its subject, the 
feminine noun amātu. 
 

amāt aqabbû kīma aqabbû lū magrat  

Line 21: Qīša (qâšu, “to give, to bestow”) and qibi are both ms imperatives. When re-
ferring to the gods, qabû often has the meaning, “to give an order, decree.” TI.LA = balāṭu, 
see line 6. Balāṭ napištīya, lit. “good health of my life,” is an objective genitive construc-
tion. That is, balāṭu is not equivalent to napištī, but is manifest in it. Lines 21–22, comprise 
the prayer’s third invocation, capsule Aʹ.

Line 22: Namriš, “brilliantly, splendidly.” Note the terminative-adverbial ending (–iš), 
indicating the manner in which  the action  of the verb is to  be enacted.  As a manner  of 
walking, namriš has the sense of “radiantly” as in “a bright mood” (CAD N/I, 239). Maḫru 
(= IGI), “front, presence.” Atalluka is a Gtn stem infinitive of alāku in the accusative case, 
meaning “to walk about, to roam about.” It is the object of the precative lušbi (šebû, “to be 
satisfied, to be full”). For more on the Akkadian use of maḫar  atalluku, see M. Weinfeld, 
“The  Covenant  of  Grant  in  the  Old  Testament  and  in  the  Ancient  Near  East,”  JAOS  90 
(1970), 185–88. Lines 22–25 utilize a series of precatives to communicate the essence of 
the prayer.  
 

maḫarka namriš atalluka lušbi  

Line 23: The two precatives from hadû and râšu, both meaning “to rejoice (in/over),” 
are synonyms in parallel construction. Enlil (Akk. Ellil) is one of the most significant dei-
ties in Mesopotamia. In Sumerian mythology, he was known as ab-ba-dingir-re-ne, “father 
of the gods.” His consort was Ninlil and together they bore many important deities, such as 
Adad,  Nanna-Suen, Nergal, Nusku, and  Shamash. Given the  long, rich history of  the an-
cient  Near  East,  it is  understandable  that  traditions  regarding its  many  deities  were  not 
uniform.  In  some  texts,  Enlil  was  considered  a  descendent  of  Anu.  Elsewhere,  he  was 
deemed a son of Ea. In either case, both Enlil and Ea are extremely important deities in the 
Babylonian pantheon. That they might rejoice over Marduk would be considered the high-
est of complements to the deity.  
 

Ellil liḫdūka Ea lirīška  

Line 24: The reading kiššatum in KAR 59 is less desirable, since mimation is not at-
tested elsewhere in the text and because one would expect the genitive case ending. There-
fore, the present text follows BMS 9 and KAR 23. Kiššatu is a political, rather than cosmo-
logical term. It refers to the dominion of kings and deities in the inhabited world. Karābu, 
“to greet (with a blessing), to beseech,” is the root of a common Akkadian word for prayer, 
ikribu.  
 

ilū ša kiššati likrubūka  

Line 25: Ilū rabûtu may refer to Enlil and Ea, since they are the nearest antecedents. 
However, this phrase generally refers to the divine council. The great gods seem to serve 
both a generic and a specific purpose, particularly in royal inscriptions. There the divine 
council may represent the entire pantheon available to the king, or it may refer to those 
specific deities relevant to the king for accomplishing a specific purpose. These purposes 
may include military aid or  the protection  of sacred  structures (see Kyle R.  Greenwood, 
“The Hearing Gods of the Assyrian Royal Inscriptions,” JANER 10 (2010), 211–18). Liṭibbū 
is a 3mp precative from ṭubbu (D of ṭâbu), “to do something well, to satisfy.”

Line 26: This line is the prayer’s rubric, which tells about the text’s classification. In 
this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is directed. As is typi-
cal, the rubric is written in Sumerian.  

Line 27:  DÙ.DÙ.BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” KEŠDA = riksu, lit. means “knot, binding,” 
but in ritual contexts it carries the connotation of arranging the show table with food and 
drink, that is, offerings, for the deity. The word is generally translated as “ritual arrange-
ment”  (CAD  R,  351–52).  NÍG.NA  =  nignakku,  “incense  burner.”  DÙ  =  epēšu,  “to  do,  to 
make.”  Šumma  .  .  .  šumma  is a syntactical construction indicating  “either  . . . or.” In its 
present context, it signifies two options for performing the ritual. This line is a variation of 
an  abbreviated  ritual  instruction  commonly  found  in  shuillas.  It  probably  serves  as  the 
catchphrase to a fuller ritual, which the exorcist would recall and perform from memory 
(see Mayer, UFBG, 119, n.3).

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

  Many  comparisons  could  be  made  between  the  epithets  of  Marduk  and 
those of Yahweh. Most are easily recognizable, such as prince (Isa 9:6), protec-
tion (Ps 41:2; 121:7; 146:9), salvation (Gen 49:18; Ps 3:8; Mic 7:7), support (2 
Sam  22:19  „  Ps  18:18;  2  Chr  16:9),  and  wise  (Job  9:4;  28:12–23;  Prov  2:6). 
However, the epithet tukulti Bābili has an interesting parallel with BH, ןוֹיּ ִצ ת ַד ֻצ ְמ, 
“stronghold  of  Zion.”  Tukultu  and  ה ָד ֻצ ְמ  are  not  semantic  equivalents,  but  they 
connote similar concepts. The former literally means, “support, trust, reliance,” 
while  the  latter  means,  “stronghold”  or  “fortress.”  According  to  biblical  tradi-
tion, ןוֹיּ ִצ ת ַד ֻצ ְמ was the original name for Jerusalem (2 Sam 5:7 „ 1 Chr 11:5) pri-
or to its conquest by David. Upon the completion of the temple, Jerusalem be-
came the locus of Israel’s deity. Thus, Zion was recognized as the holy mountain 
(Joel 4:17), Yahweh’s  throne (Ps 9:12) and dwelling place (Ps 76:3), the place 
where Yahweh’s name dwelled (Isa 18:7) and whence his name shined forth (Ps 
50:2).  Although  the  actual  phrase  ןוֹיּ ִצ  ת ַד ֻצ ְמ  only  occurs  in  the  two  aforemen-
tioned verses, the notion that Yahweh was the source of Zion’s strength and sup-
port occurs elsewhere. In Ps 31:3, the psalmist cries out to Yahweh that the deity 
would be י ִנ ֵי ִשֺׁוה ְל תֺודוּצ ְמ תי ֵב ְל “as a fortress to save me.” The same idea is present 
elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, as well (e.g., Ps 9:9; 18:2; Jer 16:19; Joel 4:16; 
Nah 1:7). In the same way, Marduk is the source of support and trust for the city 
of Babylon and for all who worshipped him. 
 
The idea of the personal god is not foreign to the biblical authors, although 
evidence of a personal goddess is not forthright. This is not to say that Yahweh 
or Elohim were only considered personal gods. Such an assertion could not be 
substantiated. However, there are instances where the theology of the personal 
god was, at the very least, in the background. Certainly, the ancestral narratives

were cognizant of the idea. In the Old Akkadian period, one way of referring to 
the  personal  god  was  il  abi,  “the  god  of  the  father,”  or  “ancestral  deity.”  This 
should  immediately  call  to  mind  the  biblical  phrase 
,  “the  god  of  my 
father,” or more specifically 
, “the god of Abraham, Isaac, 
and Jacob” (e.g. Exod 3:16). In fact, Jacob had some uncertainty whether or not 
he  would  claim  Yahweh  as  his  own  personal  god,  placing  stipulations  on  his 
commitment. If  Jacob  would return  safely  on  his  quest  for  a  wife,    י ִל  ה ָוֹהְי  הָי ָה ְו
םי ִהא ֵל,  “then  Yahweh  will  become  my  deity”  (Gen  28:21).  Another  example 
from  the  Pentateuch  is  found  in  the  account  of  Rachel  and  Laban.  As  Rachel 
leaves  her  father’s  home,  she  absconds  his  םי ִפ ָר ְתּ  (Gen  31:19).  While  there  is 
some degree of uncertainty over the precise meaning of this term, the underly-
ing idea inherent in most suggestions is that it refers to the personal or house-
hold god.1 If its etymology is rooted in אפר, “to heal,”2  then the term fits well 
with the ancients’ expectations of a personal god. Finally, Ps 22 may need to be 
considered  in  light  of  the  belief  in  the  personal  god:    קוֹח ָר  י ִנ ָתּ ְב ַז ֲ  ה ָמ ָל  י ִל ֵא  י ִל ֵא
י ִת ָג ֲא ַשׁ י ֵר ְב ִדּ י ִת ָוּשׁי ִמ, “My god, my god, why have you abandoned me? Why are my 
groans so far from my deliverance?” The supplicant cries out to their deity, in 
this case Yahweh, as one who is under attack from disease, i.e., evil spirits, and 
is in desperate need of protection from this affliction.  
 
Additionally, we find in the phrase maḫarka namriš atalluka (line 22) several 
interesting parallels. First,  namriš  derives  from  nawāru  (>  namāru).  In  Biblical 
Hebrew this root appears in noun form as ר ֵנ (from רונ), “lamp.” The u-class me-
dial vowel has been retained in the derivative noun ה ָרֺונ ְמ, “lampstand.” Second, 
the  Gtn  infinitive  atalluku  corresponds  directly  to  the  Hebrew  hitpael  (Gtn) 
ך ֵלּ ַה ְת ִה. Furthermore, maḫarka atalluku is analogous to י ַנ ָפ ְל ך ֵלּ ַה ְת ִה (Gen 17:1). The 
reflexive form of the verbs indicates repetitive, habitual action. Examples of this 
phrase are attested in Gen 24:40 and 48:15. Third, several of the psalms express 
the idea communicated in the phrase. Psalm 16:11 says, “You inform me of the 
way  of  life.  Your  presence is the  fullness  of joy.  Good fortune  is  in  your  right 
hand  forever.”  Even  more  striking  is  Ps  43,  a  psalm  of  lament  with  a  similar 
theme as Capsule Aʹ of our prayer. Verse 4 reads, “Then I will go to the altar of 
God; to God, the source of my joy. I will praise you on the lyre, O God, my god.” 
In  both  of  these  examples  the  psalmists  articulate  the  same  sentiment  as  the 
supplicant in our prayer to Marduk. That is, living in the presence of the deity 
brings immeasurable joy to the life of the worshiper.

NABU:  

ӎӘ 

A Shuilla: Nabu 1 

ALAN LENZI 

A Babylonian scribal god hailing from Borsippa, Nabu was the son of Mar-
duk and a major god in the post-OB Mesopotamian pantheon. His consort was 
Tashmetu.  Although  attested  already  in  the  early  second  millennium,  we  can 
trace Nabu’s rise to prominence only starting in the later second millennium. His 
status  in  the  pantheon  reached  its  zenith  during  the  Neo-Assyrian  and  Neo-
Babylonian periods, as attested by the several temples and shrines dedicated to 
him  in  many  major  Assyrian  and  Babylonian  cities  (e.g.,  Nineveh,  Nimrud, 
Borsippa,  and  Babylon).  Personal  names  are  further  proof  of  his  importance. 
Nabu  was  the  most  common  deity  invoked  in  Neo-Assyrian  theophoric  names 
and  second  only  to  Marduk  in  first  millennium  Babylonia.  Note  especially  the 
Neo-Babylonian  royal  names  Nebuchadnezzar  (Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur,  “O  Nabu, 
guard my firstborn”) and Nabonidus (Nabû-naʾid, “Nabu is praised”).  

Archaeologists have uncovered tablets in several of Nabu’s É-zi-da temples 
(“The  True  House”).  The  Nimrud  finds  are  especially  impressive,  which  have 
yielded  copies  of the  Succession  Treaty  of  Esarhaddon  (see  SAA  2,  no.  6)  in  a 
throne room and about three hundred tablets of literary content in the temple’s 
library (see CTN IV).1 Tablets found in libraries at Ashur, Nineveh, and Huzirina 
(modern Sultan Tepe) bear formulaic colophons that clearly demonstrate scribal 
devotion to Nabu (e.g., Hunger, BAK, nos. 233, 318, and 353, the latter of which 
reads tākilka ul ibâš Nabû, “the one who trusts in you, O Nabu, will not be put to 
shame”).  

In keeping with his function as the scribe of the gods, Nabu was represented 
by a stylus or wedge in iconography. Celestially, he is associated with the planet 
Mercury. He is mentioned by name in the Bible in Isa 46:1. 
 
1  For  a  general  overview  of  the  tablet  finds,  see  Joan  and  David  Oates,  Nimrud:  An  Assyrian 
Imperial City Revealed (London: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2001), 203–10.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

THE PRAYER:  

The prayer adapts the typical three-part structure of shuillas. It starts with 
the customary hymnic introduction in lines 1–11. Line 12 contains the usual self-
identification  formula  and  recognition  of  the  supplicant’s  humble  position  in 
relation  to  the  deity  (“the  servant  who  fears  you”).  Lines  13–20  comprise  the 
prayer’s  petition  section,  thematically-centered  on  the  supplicant’s  old  age.  A 
description of piety (lines 13–14) precedes the complaint (lines 15–18). A reca-
pitulation of the invocation follows in line 19 (compare with line 1) just before 
the prayer’s very brief petition proper in line 20. The prayer concludes with a 
one line formulaic promise of future praise (line 21).  

Joel Hunt has recognized a tri-partite structure to the opening hymn based 
on grammatical and thematic features. In lines 1–5 substantives and participial 
phrases that describe Nabu’s character predominate. These lines present a time-
less  portrait  of  Nabu’s  attributes.  In  Lines  6–8  complete  sentences  using  third 
person verbs describe  Nabu’s word, his relationship to  his father,  Marduk, and 
thus  his  position  within  the  hierarchy  of  the  gods.  Finally,  lines  9–10,  using 
complete sentences and second person verbs (if one follows Mayer’s MS B in line 
9),  characterize  Nabu  as one  willing  and  able to  help  a  supplicant  with  angry 
personal deities. The use of second person verbs in this final part of the hymn 
begins a transition between the hymnic introduction and the petition section. 

Although its structure is fairly typical, the prayer offers a couple of points of 
literary interest. I have already mentioned how line 19 near the end of the pray-
er, positioned between lament and petition, re-invokes the deity with words that 
recall the first line. Notice also that the use of the words “days” and “years” in 
line 17, part of the lament, recalls the vocabulary of line 3, part of the hymnic 
introduction.  The  employment  of  the  verb  ṣabātu,  “to  seize,  hold,”  in  line  20 
harks back to the same verb in line 2, if the restoration is correct: Nabu holds his 
stylus; the supplicant seizes Nabu’s prayer. Finally, just as Nabu is the one who 
opens  the  ear  (line  2)  to  receive  divine  insight,  the  supplicant  is  the  one  who 
opens their hands (line 14) in prayer (for a possible pun, see the notes on line 
14). It seems the prayer re-uses the vocabulary of the first few lines throughout 
the remainder of the prayer, but especially toward its conclusion, thereby giving 
the prayer a certain coherence with regard to language. 

The prayer presents the  supplicant  as an elderly person (lines 14 and  17), 
perhaps  one  who  has  lived  a  life  of  devotion  (line  13).  Despite  their  humility 
before  the gods and humans (?, lines 15–16),  they feel they have not received 
the  favor  and  mercy  due  them  (line  18).  The  precise  nature  and  origin  of  the 
mistreatment—whether  from  the  gods  or  humans  or  both—are  not  entirely 
clear. But one might infer from lines 9–10 that the anger of the supplicant’s per-
sonal gods is involved. One might also consider, in light of the supplicant’s years 
having come to an end (line 17), that the supplicant worries about their impend-
ing death. In any case, the  supplicant wishes to be  set free from that  which is 
troubling them (line 20). There is little more that can be said without indulging 
in speculation.

Two of the three  MSS used in Mayer’s edition (A and B) preserve ritual in-
structions,  though  Mayer  himself  did  not  include  them  in  his  edition  (see 
Ebeling, AGH, 12, who provides several conjectural restorations). Unfortunately, 
both tablets  are  broken  or  abraded  in  the  same  area  of  the  ritual  instructions, 
leaving us with an incomplete picture of the actions prescribed. What does seem 
relatively  clear  is  the  setting  up  of  censors  and  having  the  supplicant  repeat 
some of the words of the prayer. The final act is a prostration, a fitting gesture of 
subordination as one leaves the presence of a superior.  

One final comment: The colophons of MSS A and B indicate that the tablets 
were copied by young scribes (šamallû ṣeḫru), perhaps wishing to make a good 
impression on their patron deity (see Hunger, BAK, nos. 235 and 395).2 
 
2  Mayer’s MS A (KAR 25 +) contains the following shuillas: Nabu 1, Marduk 2, 18, 19, Nabu 2, 
Sin 9, and Enlil 1b, in that order, followed by a fourteen-line colophon, in which a very proud 
young  scribe  traces  his  genealogy  back  several  generations.  MS  B  (STT  55)  contains  Marduk  2 
and Nabu 1, followed by a fragmentary, one line colophon.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” This word marks the beginning of the prayer. It is 
not a part of the prayer itself. dAG = Nabû. There is no question that this prayer is directed 
to Nabu (see lines 7, 19, and 22). There is, however, some question as to whether the text 
actually  indicates  this  by  stating the  deity’s  name  at  its  beginning  (the  sign  read as  AG 
here is partly broken).  Rēštû,  “firstborn, preeminent.” One’s semantic decision should be 
based on the whole line, especially the meaning of IBILA. For confirmation, see the usage in 
CAD R, 275, which cites this lexeme in other contexts alongside māru and aplu.  IBILA = 
aplu,  “heir, son.”  Kēnu (kīnu), “true.” Here, the word denotes legitimacy, as  in the “true 
heir.”

Line  2:  Ṣabātu,  “to  seize,  to  hold.”  GI  =  qanû,  “reed”  (qan  =  bound  form).  Ṭuppu, 
“tablet.”  One  should translate the words “the reed of the tablet” in light of the material 
culture  of  the  Mesopotamian  scribe.  With  what  did  scribes  write?  Note  the  sound  play 
between kēnu and qan in lines 1 and 2, respectively. Is this significant? Note also the use of 
kittu, the feminine form of kēnu, in the following phrase said of Nabu: ṣābit-ma qan ṭuppu 
kittu, “(Nabu), who holds the proper stylus” (cited in CAD K, 393). BAD = pītu, “opening” 
(lit.); or  BAD =  petû, “to open.” Ḫasissu is usually  written ḫasīsu (see  CDA, 109, CAD Ḫ, 
126, and the variant in Mayer’s MS C: ḫa-si-[si]), “aperture of the ear, understanding.” BAD 
may be understood as either the noun pītu or a participle, pētû, “the one who opens.” The 
former  interpretation  yields  pīt  ḫasissi,  literally,  “opening  of  the  ear,”  which denotes  ex-
traordinary  intelligence  (CAD  P,  446).  Here  the  phrase  would  imply  that  extraordinary 
intelligence  is  an  attribute  of  the  deity  and  is  related  to  or  possibly  a  result  of  Nabu’s 
scribal ability. But what is one to do with the phonetic complement –u? The latter inter-
pretation  (BAD  =  pētû)  maintains  the  grammatical  parallel  with  lines  3  and  4  (and  the 
restoration in line 2) and implies that Nabu, as the paradigmatic scribe, imparts knowledge 
to  human  scribes.  The  implication  of  the  phrase  is  revelatory,  as  Ludlul  bēl  nēmeqi  II  8, 
using the near synonym uznu, demonstrates: zaqīqu abāl-ma ul upatti uznī, “I prayed to the 
dream god, but he did not open my ear.” As for the phonetic complement on BAD, in SB 
Akkadian a participle from a III-weak root in construct with a following substantive often 
ends  with  –û  (see  Brigitte  R.  M.  Groneberg,  Syntax,  Morphologie  und  Stil  der  jungbaby-
lonischen  „hymnischen“  Literatur,  2  Vols.  [Freiburger  Altorientalische  Studien  14/1–2; 
Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 1.95). 
 
   
Line 3:  UD.MEŠ =  ūmū (f.  ūmātu), plural(s) of ūmu,  “day.” Barû, “to watch over,  to 
inspect, to observe”; also used technically by scribes in tablet colophons, “to collate.” The 
latter  usage is  not appropriate  here,  but  may  provide  background  information  for  inter-
preting Nabu’s epithet here in line 3b. MU.(AN.NA.)MEŠ = šanātu, plural of šattu, “year” (see 
line 17 also). 
 
   
Line 4: Eṭēru, “to spare (someone).” Possibly read [na-ṣir], from naṣāru, “to protect, to 
guard.”  Napištu,  “life.”  Turru  (D  of  târu)  gimilla,  “to  return  a  kindness,  to  avenge.”  The 
social and literary context in which this phrase is used determines the kind of return one 
will receive, good or bad (see CAD G, 74–75 for examples). Given the positive epithet in 
line 4a, the returning of a kindness may seem most appropriate. But, one may also enter-
tain the idea that line 4a is directed at the speaker of the prayer while 4b against those 
who would threaten the speaker’s life. In this case, avenging may be the best interpreta-
tion. Given the possibilities, one may wish to choose a translation that conveys both posi-

Line  5:  SAG.KAL  =  ašarēdu  (ašaridu),  “leader,  foremost.”  DINGIR.MEŠ  =  ilū,  “gods.”

the second part of the line. Bānû, “progenitor, creator.” This term is commonly found in 
apposition with abu, “father.” See CAD B, 94.  
 
   
Line 7: dTU.TU = Marduk. DUMU = māru, “son.” Notice the grammatical and semantic 
parallel constructions in lines 6 and 7. The verb, ul enni, and the kinship terms, bānû and 
māru, occupy the same place in each line, but there is a chiastic pattern in the positions of 
zikiršu / zikir Nabû and abu / dTU.TU. 
Marduk ul enni zikir Nabû mārīšu 
 
   
Line 8: Māšu, “twin brother,” is the third kinship term in the last few lines. Mayer’s 
MS B has maš-še-šu (normalized maššêšu). Maššû is a by-form of māšu (see CAD M/1, 401). 
How  might  one  understand  the  idea  of  the  gods  as  Nabu’s  twin  brothers?  Perhaps  he 
is/was their equal or peer. Amātu (awātum), “word.” Ṣīru, “august, supreme, exalted,” is a 
very common adjective used with divinity (see CAD Ṣ, 210–12). Here the adjective is pre-
dicative (3fs). The exaltation of Nabu’s word in the latter part of the line may indicate his 
position of authority over those gods once his peers. 
 
  
Line 9: Notice the change of person here and in line 10. The prayer now directly ad-
dresses Nabu with second person verbs. Lines 9 and 10 are characterized by strong gram-
matical  and  semantic  parallelism:  both  begin  with  relative  clauses  describing  a  person 
experiencing divine anger (god and goddess, alternately) and then contain a second person 
verb  plus  complement  (substantive  or  prepositional  phrase,  both  ending  in  –šu).  Sabāsu 
(more commonly šabāsu), “to be angry.” Suḫḫuru (D of saḫāru), “to turn (away, toward).” 
The  above  text  follows  Mayer’s  MS  B,  which  shows  a  second  person  durative  verb 
(tusaḫḫar); this reading enhances the parallelism between lines 9 and 10. (MS A has a third

person preterite, usaḫḫira.) GÚ = kišādu, “neck.” The š of the 3ms pronominal suffix (–šu) 
and  the  final  dental  consonant  (d)  of  the  noun  change  to  –ss–  (–dš–  becomes  –ss–).  To 
whom  does  the  pronominal  suffix  on  this  word  refer?  Nabu  is  the  implied  subject  of 
tusaḫḫar.  The  idiom  suḫḫuru  kišāda  (or  pānī),  “to  turn  the  neck  (or  face),”  indicates  the 
direction of the neck’s owner’s attention, away, toward, or back to someone or something, 
depending on context. See CAD S, 49–50. In this case, Nabu turns the angry personal god 
back to his devotee. While the deity’s attention is directed away from his or her ward, the 
individual is open to all kinds of potential evils. Thus it is important for the deity’s face (or 
neck) to be turned at all times toward the devotee. For a discussion of the personal god, 
see page 431. 
 
   
Line  10:  Zenû,  “to  be  angry.”  Zenât  is a  3fs  predicative  form.  NAM  =  šīmtu,  “fate.” 
Here, however, the term probably refers to an individual’s personal goddess (ištaru), thus 
completing the parallelism started in line 9 of the angered personal god. An angry personal 
god and goddess is a common motif in Mesopotamian prayers. Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to 
reconcile.” Itti, “with.” 
 
   
Line 11:  Mayer’s  MS B adds a self-identification  formula  here in two  lines after  our 
line 10. They are inserted here for sake of interest. Line 11 continues the grammatical and 
semantic parallelism of lines 9–10. Arnu, “guilt.” The n of the bound form (aran–) assimi-
lates to the š of the pronominal suffix. Išû,  “to have, to own.” Paṭāru, “to release.” 
 
   
Line 12: NENNI A NENNI = annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so.” This is 
a very common phrase in prayers. It serves as a placeholder for the name and filiation of 
the person speaking the prayer (as in the phrase, “I, state your name”). Annanna sometimes 
also holds the place for the names of a person’s personal god and goddess. ÌR = (w)ardu, 
“servant.”  The  god–devotee  relationship  is  imagined  in  terms  of a  king and  his servant. 
Palāḫu, “to fear.” The presence of this line, a self-presentation formula, at this point in the 
prayer clearly signals a transition from hymn to petition. 
 
   
Line 13: Meṣḫarūtu (meṣḫerūtu), “youth.” How does this word influence one’s under-
standing of the prayer? How does this line fit with the next? Is there a contrast between 
youth and old age or does the supplicant intend to show continuity of devotion throughout 
life? It is difficult to say because a key word in the line, ma-ši-šu-ti, is obscure (see Hunt, 
217–19 for the following options). The text is secure (against CAD M/2, 37), but the mean-
ing is uncertain. Deriving the term from the root mašāšu, “to wipe,” one might understand 
the word as mašišūti, an adverbial accusative of condition, and translate it with regard to

the  end  result  of  wiping,  “in  a  purified  condition”  (see  Mayer,  472,  “in  gereinigtem 
Zustand  [?]”).  However,  the  word  may  describe  the  wiping  action  itself  rather  than  its 
result. In this case, one might suppose that the supplicant’s hands were constantly moving 
about—as if wiping something—while uplifted in prayer (see Karel van der Toorn, Sin and 
Sanction  in  Israel  and  Mesopotamia:  A  Comparative  Study  [SSN  22;  Assen:  Van  Gorcum, 
1985], 96 and  209, n.22,  who  translates the word “with ever fidgety  hands” and sees a 
contrast between youth and old age in lines 11 and 12). Suppû, “to pray.” 
 
   
Line 14: Šēbu (šību), “old person, elder.” The form is predicative (1cs). Note the life-
cycle contrast with line 13: youth to old age.  DÙ = kalû, “all, totality”; but in construct, 
kal(a), “all of, the whole of, everyone of.” Upnu, “hand.” Note the dual form with 1cs suf-
fix. Petû upnī, lit. “to open the hands”; more idiomatically, “to pray.” In line 14, upnu is the 
subject (upnā is nom. dual) and petâ is 3fp predicative. This phrase may be punning on the 
idiom discussed in the notes to line 2, petû uzna. If so, the line may imply that a petû upna, 
“opening of the hand,” was one way to receive a petû uzna, “opening of the ear” (i.e., a 
divine response). In any case, opening or raising one’s hands was a basic petitionary ritual 
gesture in the ancient Near East (see Mayer I. Gruber, Aspects of Nonverbal Communication 
in the Ancient Near East [Studia Pohl 12/1; Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1980], 50–59). 
This gesture, of course, is closely related to the label that identifies many Mesopotamian 
prayers, namely, šu-íl-lá = šuʾillakku, “(prayer of) lifted hands.” 
 
   
Line 15: Lipin appi, lit. “stroking of the nose, prostration.” The word  lipnu /  libnu is 
not  recognized by the CAD (see L, 11 labānu); rather, see AHw, 551 or  CDA, 182  under 
libnu. Karû, “to be(come) short.” Notice the Assyrian form of the 3fs G perfect (with pre-
fixed  ta–  and  harmonization  of  the  second  syllable’s  vowel).  With  napaltu  (=  napaštu), 
“life, throat, breath,” as the subject, the verb means, “to be(come) short of breath.” One 
may wish to translate this phrase more idiomatically as a first person verb. 
 
   
Line 16: IGI = pānu, “face.” Ina pāni, “in front of, before.” NAM.LÚ.U18/19.LU = amīlūtu 
(awīlūtum), “humanity.” Kīma, “like, as.” Meḫû, “storm, whirlwind.” Anāku, “I.” How does 
one explain this simile? A few suggestions: The simile may be a poetic expansion upon the 
person’s breathlessness noted in line 15; it may indicate the speaker’s poor bodily condi-
tion; it may be an attempt to convey the speaker’s tumultuous life in broader human socie-
ty; or, in light of line 17, the simile may indicate the transitory character of the speaker’s 
existence. In other contexts, meḫû in similes and metaphors conveys strength, chaos, and 
even violence (see CAD M/2, 6). Since similes activate a field of associations, one need not 
nail this simile down to one meaning.

Line 17: Notice the similarity between this line and line 3 (if the restoration is cor-
rect). Is the end of the prayer looking back to the beginning? See also line 19, assuming 
the correctness of the restorations there. Ittatlakū is a Gt perfect of alāku, “to go, to walk”; 
in the Gt, “to go away.” It makes little sense for “days to go away,” so one will need to 
choose a verb in the translation that conveys the sense more idiomatically. Qatû, “to come 
to  an  end,  to  finish.”  As  the  line  progresses  it  shows  an  intensification,  depicted  in  the 
action  of  the  verbs  (leaving  vs.  coming  to  an  end)  and  the  duration  of  time  (days  vs. 
years). The supplicant, it seems, believes themselves to be as good as dead. 
 
   
Line 18: SIG5 = dumqu, “good fortune.” Nēmelu, “benefit, gain, profit.” As is common 
in SB Akkadian, the nom. stands in place of the expected acc. case.  TUKU = rašû, “to ac-
quire.” Since the first verb in the line is a preterite, the one from rašû is likely to be one as 
well. Line 18 indicates a general absence of success throughout the speaker’s life. 
 
   
Line 19:  Gešru (gašru), “powerful, mighty. Used substantively, this word was a very 
common epithet for deities in Mesopotamian prayers. This line recapitulates the invocation 
at  the  beginning  of  the  prayer.  Given  its  proximity  to  the  conclusion  of  the  prayer,  one 
might interpret this line as purely literary, creating a sort of ring structure in the prayer, or 
as  a  rhetorical  intensification,  increasing  the  sense  of  urgency  within  the  prayer.  In  the 
latter case, this line insures the deity’s attention just before stating the petition in the fol-
lowing line. 
 
   
Line 20: Notice again, if the restorations are correct, the harking back to words from 
the beginning of the prayer: ṣabātu also occurs in line 2 (restored). Here the preterite may 
have  a  performative  sense,  and  may  thus  be  best  rendered  with  a  present.  Si?-pe-e-ka  is 
obscure. It may be sīpu, “prayer.” Thus, aṣbat sīpēka, literally, “I seize your prayers”; more 
idiomatically, “I pray to you” (see CAD Ṣ, 32 for an analogy). The word may also be sippu, 
“doorjamb.” If so, then the line may merely indicate that the speaker has come to Nabu’s 
temple for supplication, “I take hold of your (temple’s) doorjambs.” In any case, line 20a 
remains uncertain. Kullumu, “to show.” The verb form is a D ms imperative with 1cs suffix: 
kullimmanni stands here for kullimanni, as is evident from MS A’S ritual section, which reads 
kul-li-ma-an-ni (see line 29). ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.” (A variant in Mayer’s MS B reads: lūmur 
nūru, “let me see the light.”) One may think on first glance to interpret the phrase kulli-
manni  nūra, “show me the light,” in terms of a revelatory experience (or perhaps even a 
wish for death). The idiom, however, derives from the imagery of a prisoner being set free 
from a dark prison cell. See CAD K, 524. In light of Nabu’s ability to turn back the anger of 
one’s personal deities (lines 9–10) and in light of the fact that the speaker seems to have

had a lifetime without good fortune, it may be that the freedom the speaker seeks is free-
dom from divine displeasure. However, one might also consider, since the speaker believes 
themselves to be at the end of their years, that this wish is a desire to be freed from death 
itself, the final prison of all the living. 
 
    
Line  21:  Narbû,  “greatness,”  pl.  “great  deeds.”  Šūpû  (Š  of  [w]apû),  “to  proclaim,  to 
announce.” This verb and the one  in 21b are precatives, “let me. .  .  .” Dalīlū,  “praises.” 
Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and 
its object both come from the same root. One should translate this idiomatically, “let me 
proclaim your praises” or the like. Shuilla-prayers almost always conclude with some form 
of foreword looking praise. The phrases narbīka lušāpi and dalīlīka ludlul are very common-
ly used for this purpose (see CAD A/2, 202–3). 
 
   
Line 22: This line is the rubric, that is, it tells something about the classification of 
the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it 
is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the 
wording of a lifted-hand to Nabu.” 
   
Line 23: DÙ.DÙ.BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” KI = qaqqaru, “ground.” SAR = šabāṭu, “to 
sweep, to clear away.” The form is probably to be understood as a 2ms durative, as are 
most of the verbs in these instructions. A.MEŠ = mû, “water.” KÙ.MEŠ = ellūtu (mp), “pure, 
clean.” SUD = salāḫu, “to sprinkle (with).” GI.DU8 = paṭīru, “portable altar.” GIN = kunnu 
(D of kânu), “to set up.” 
 
   
Line 24: 2 = šinā (with a m. noun). NÍG.NA = nignakku, “incense burner.” 1-en = ištēn, 
“one.” dUTU.È = ṣīt šamši, “sunrise, east.” 2-tú = šanītu, “second.”  dUTU.ŠU.A = ereb šamši, 
“sunset, west.” GAR = šakānu, “to put, to place.”  
 
   
Line 25: This line is obscure due to breaks in the text. Perhaps the first part of the line 
makes  reference  to  a  propitious  day  of  Nabu,  but  that  is  speculative.  GIŠ.EREN  =  erēnu, 
“cedar.”

Line 26: GIŠ.ŠIM.LI = burāšu, “juniper” (pieces of wood or its resin). The juniper is the 
material to be burnt in the incense burners. Kilallān (m), kilattān (f), “both.” Both incense 
burners (line 24) are supposed to contain cedar and juniper (?). 
 
   
Line 27: Sarāqu, “to scatter, to strew.” What is scattered is uncertain. See CAD S, 172–
74 for various options and Ebeling, AGH, 12 for his conjecture. Miḫḫu, “a kind of beer.” 
GEŠTIN.MEŠ =karānu, “wine.” BAL = naqû, “to pour out, to libate, to sacrifice.” 
 
   
Line  28:  DU11.GA  =  qabû,  “to  speak,  to  say.”  The  restoration  of  instructions  for  the 
supplicant (thus a 3cs durative verb) to speak seems reasonable. See also line 30. It seems 
that part of the prayer is repeated in lines 28–29. Here we may have a reprise of part of

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 ָפּ
 ח ַת

ן ֶזֹא ָה־ת ֶא

 
A  few  idioms  in  the  prayer  are  worthy  of  our  comparative  attention.  The 
phrase pētû ḫasīsu, “the one who opens the ear,” in line 2 is comparable to the 
BH phrase 
, “to open the ear” (Isa 50:5 and 48:8) and the similar  ה ָל ָגּ
ן ֶזֹא ָה־ת ֶא, “to uncover the ear” (see 1 Sam 9:15, 20:2, 12, 13, 22:8 (2x’s), 22:17, 2 
Sam 7:27, Isa 22:14, Job 33:16, 36:10, 15, Ruth 4:4, and 1 Chron 17:25). In ref-
erence  to  human  activity,  the  Hebrew  idioms  mean  “to  inform”  (e.g.,  1  Sam 
20:13). When a deity is the one informing a human, however, the idiom denotes 
revelatory activity (e.g., 1 Sam 9:15 and Isa 50:5). The means of conveying the 
information may be different (e.g., a  dream, prophetic intuition, or  the scribal 
tradition,  as  our prayer  implies),  but the  Hebrew  and  Akkadian  phrases  desig-
nate  the  same  mythological  idea:  a  deity  somehow  informs  a  human  of  some-
thing he or she would not otherwise have known apart from the deity.

Turru (D of târu) gimilla, “to return a kindness, to  avenge,” in line 4 com-
pares to the BH phrase לוּמ ְגּ בי ִשׁ ֵה, “to return in kind,” and לוּמ ְגּ ם ֵלּ ִשׁ, “to repay in 
kind.” As with the Akkadian phrase, the BH phrases can indicate something ei-
ther positive or negative, depending on the situation. The idea is simply that one 
receives  treatment  (i.e.,  requital)  in  accord  with  one’s  own  actions  (see  Obad 
15). The phrases are usually used negatively, designating a payment of retribu-
tion against evildoers, the proud, or enemies (see, e.g., Ps 28:4, 94:2, Isa 66:6, 
Jer 51:6, and Ps 137:8). But the positive use is also attested (see Prov 19:17 and 
2 Chron 32:25). For the two phrases in the same context (of requiting an ene-
my), see Joel 4:4. 
 
The idiom suḫḫuru kišāda (or pānī), “to turn the neck (or face) back toward 
or  away  from,”  when  used  negatively  (i.e.,  in the  sense  of  “away from”)  com-
pares conceptually1 to the common BH idea of the deity hiding his face (רי ִתּ ְס ִה 
םי ִנ ָפּ ַה־ת ֶא, see, e.g., Pss 13:2, 27:9, 44:25, 69:18, 88:15, 102:3, and 143:7). As Ps 
143:7  indicates,  when  the  deity  hides  his  face,  the  supplicant  feels  like  one 
headed for the grave. The opposite of the deity hiding his face is the deity mak-
ing his face to shine upon, i.e., to be happy with, an individual (םי ִנ ָפּ ַה־ת ֶא  רי ִא ֵה, 
see, e.g., Pss 31:17, 67:2, 80:4, 8, 20, 119:135, and of course Num 6:25). As in 
Mesopotamia, devotees in ancient Israel desired the protective attention of their 
deity at all times. 
 
Turning to a more thematic level of comparison, one can see that our Akka-
dian prayer presents a supplicant advanced in years, perhaps at death’s gates. Ps 
71, a lament of the individual, depicts a comparable supplicant and is therefore 
related, thematically-speaking.2 In this psalm the  supplicant  explicitly recounts 
their devotion during not only their youth (vv. 5 and 17) but even from birth (v. 
6)!  They fear,  however, in their old age  (ה ָנ ְק ִז  ת ֵ, v. 9a, and  ה ָבי ֵשׂ ְו  ה ָנ ְק ִז, v.  18), 
when they most need the deity (י ִחֹכּ תוֹל ְכ ִכּ, “when my strength is failing,” v. 9b), 
, vv. 9 
Yahweh has cast them aside (
, v. 9), abandoned them (
and 18a), and become distant (
, v. 12). This abandonment is not death 
as we define it (i.e., cessation of bodily functions) because it is precisely during 
this period of divine  absence that the supplicant fears their enemies will  over-
take them (vv. 10–11). Viewed from the perspective of their own ancient Israel-
ite milieu, however, the supplicant was as  good as dead, so that they describe 
their restoration as nothing less than a kind of resurrection: “you will make me 
live  again  and  draw  me  up  again  out  of  the  depths”  (i.e.,  Sheol)  (בוּשׁ ָתּ    י ִני ֵיּ ַח ְתּ
י ִנ ֵל ֲ ַתּ  בוּשׁ ָתּ  ץ ֶר ָא ָה  תוֹמֹה ְתּ ִמוּ;  v.  20).3  The  supplicant  alternates  between  praise,  la-
 
1  There are attestations of turning (בוּשׁ in the hiphil) the face toward (e.g., Dan 11:18) or away 
from (e.g., Ezek 14:6) someone or something in BH, of course, but this idiom does not convey 
the idea of divine abandonment or renewal of attention. 
2  For old age in ancient Israel, see J. Gordon Harris, “Old Age,” ABD 4:10–12. 
3  For this qualified notion of resurrection, see Jon D. Levenson, Resurrection and the Restoration 
of Israel: The Ultimate Victory of the God of Life (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006), 35–66.

8. Among the gods, his peers, his word is august. 
9. To the one whose god was angry  you turn his (i.e., the god’s) attention back.

15. On account of prostration, I have become short of breath.

A Shuilla: Nergal 2 

TZVI ABUSCH 

NERGAL:  

Nergal is a god of death and of war (as the one who inflicts death in war). 
The  name  Nergal probably means,  or  at least  was  understood  as,  dnin-uru-gal-
(ak), “Lord of the great city (i.e., the netherworld).” The standard writing of the 
name  Nergal  is  dGÌR-eri11-gal (GÌR  here  is  read by  some  as  nè);  this  writing  is 
gradually replaced by  dU.GUR.  The writing u.gur  has been interpreted by W. G. 
Lambert as uqur, the imperative of naqāru, “to destroy.”1 The name Nergal in our 
text is written both as dU.GUR and as dGÌR-eri11-gal. Nergal’s main temple, É-mes-
lam,  “house,  warrior  of  the  netherworld,”  is  in  Cutha,  where  he  is  also  called 
Meslamtaʾea, “the one who comes forth from the Meslam.” His parentage is Nip-
purian: Enlil and Ninlil. He is associated with the planet Mars as well as with the 
netherworld. (In the myth Nergal and Ereshkigal, he takes his place as its ruler 
together with Ereshkigal.) Thus, he has a place both in heaven and in the neth-
erworld (see lines 5–8).  
 
1  “Studies in Nergal,” BiOr 5/6 (1973), 356. 

THE PRAYER:  

This prayer to Nergal is an excellent example of a shuilla-prayer. It contains 
the three expected sections: a hymnic introduction in which the god is invoked 
and described (1–10); a supplication containing the self-presentation of the peti-
tioner,  a  description  of  his  difficulty,  his  approach  to  the  god,  and  his request 
(11–23);  and  a promise of praise (24). The sections are clearly  articulated and 
coherent; they are thematically well-developed and have a formal shape. I limit 
my  comments  here  to  the  hymnic  introduction  and  to  lines  15–18  where  the 
speaker  sets  out  the  features of  Nergal  that  have  encouraged  him to  approach 
the god. 

Hymnic Introduction: The hymnic introduction is devoted to the descriptive 
praise of Nergal. It contains three stanzas that are syntactically linked together. 
They treat the god’s nature and place in a divine family (lines 1–4); his place in 

 

339

340

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

the cosmos (lines 5–8); and his relationship to the world of humans and animals 
(lines 9–10). 

The first stanza treats two themes: the god’s nature as a warrior (a) and his 
place  in  a  divine  family  (b).  Each  line  is  made  up  of  two  half-lines;  the  lines 
form  couplets  and  the  two  couplets  form  a  stanza.  The  two  aforementioned 
themes  are  integrated  and  laid  out  chiastically.  Notice  that  the  chiasm  is  re-
versed in the second couplet:  

1.   a     b 

      × 

2.   bʹ    aʹ 
3.   b    ( ) 

      × 

4.   aʹ    bʹ 

Note, however, that the composer deviated from the chiastic pattern in the sec-
ond  part  of  line  3,  where  instead  of  presenting  a  feature  of  Nergal’s  power 
(theme a), he provides an epithet of Kutushar, Nergal’s mother, thus explicating 
and expanding on the first half of the line. 

The second stanza describes the god’s place in the cosmos. Here, again, the 
composer  follows  a  formal  structure.  Each  couplet  contains  two  parallel  lines. 
Yet,  here,  the  form  is  different  from  that  of  lines  1–4,  for  lines  5–6  are  each 
made  up  of  two  independent  (though  obviously  associated)  clauses,  whereas 
both  lines  7  and  8  form  single  clauses.  Common  themes  and,  even  more,  the 
distribution  of  grammatical  forms  between  lines  and  between  couplets,  draw 
together  each  of  the  individual  subsections  and,  then,  the  stanza  as  a  whole. 
That  is,  grammatically,  line  5a  parallels  line  6a,  and  line  7a  parallels  line  8a; 
moreover, whereas the first half-lines draw together each of the two subsections 
(lines 5–6 and 7–8), the latter halves draw together the stanza as a whole, for 
the corresponding half-lines 5b/7b and 6b/8b share syntactic forms: 

5a. 2ms pred. + prep. (ina) + region 
6a. 2ms pred. + prep. (ina) + region 
7a. prep. (itti) DN(s) + prep. (ina) + region        7b. subject with 2ms suffix + pred. 
8a. prep. (itti) DN(s) + prep. (ina) + region        8b. prefixed verb (2ms) + object 

      5b. pred.+ subject with 2ms suffix 
      6b. object + prefixed verb (2ms) 

 
 

Whereas the parallel lines of each couplet have the same syntax and grammati-
cal  word order  in their first half, the latter halves of these lines correspond in 
respect to their syntax not with each other, but rather with those of the other 
couplet:  5b/7b,  6b/8b.  Note,  moreover,  the  chiastic  arrangement  of  the gram-
matical  forms in  the  corresponding  lines  of the  two  couplets  (5b  ×  7b,  6b  × 
8b). Thus, the first half-lines define and draw together the individual couplets, 
and the final half-lines define and draw together the stanza as a whole. 

The  third  stanza  describes  the  god’s  relationship  to  humans  and  animals, 
thus bringing the god down to earth and serving as a prelude to the petitioner’s 

 

ӎゞ A SHUILLA: NERGAL 2 

341

call upon the god in the next section. This stanza is made up of two clauses, each 
of  which  extends  over  a  whole  poetic  line.  But  in  contrast  to  lines  7–8,  the 
clauses in lines 9–10 are connected by the enclitic –ma attached to iddikkā-ma of 
line 9 and thus form a longer sentence.  

Thus,  lines  1–4  comprise  a  series  of  hemistichs  where  each  half  contrasts 
with the  other, lines  5–6 comprise  a series of hemistichs where each half sup-
plements the other, lines 7–8 comprise full clauses, and finally lines 9–10 have 
two full clauses that are connected with each other. The types of clauses form a 
sequence  that  unify  the  hymn  and  move  from  an  arena  where  the  gods  alone 
exist to  areas  of  concern  to  humans,  from  the poetic  divine  to  the prosaic  hu-
man, from the world of the divine alluded to by compact poetic images to the 
world of the human depicted in drawn out prosaic descriptions. 

Approach to the God: In lines 15–18 the speaker then points to the features 
of Nergal that have encouraged him to approach the god. Before laying out the 
structure and form of these lines, I should first note that against the majority of 
witnesses, I follow Mayer’s MS B (K.2836+) in placing our line 17 before line 18 
because muppalsāta of line 18 should, I think, lead directly into naplisannī-ma of 
line 19. Contrary to this order, these lines are transposed in the other MSS and in 
the main edition of Mayer. Lines 15, 16, 17, 18, as I number them in the present 
treatment, parallel each other. More specifically, the opening hemistichs of lines 
15–18 all contain: aššum + a predicative adjectival form which describes a per-
manent feature of the divine addresee + a 2ms subject pronominal suffix (gam-
malāta ‖ tayyārāta ‖ rēmēnêta ‖ muppalsāta). The second hemistichs of these lines 
all contain verbs in the same grammatical form: 1cs perfect + either a 2ms ob-
ject  pronominal  suffix  or  an  accusative  noun  +  a  2ms  possessive  pronominal 
suffix. The verbs in the opening halves of these lines seem to be synonymous. On 
the  other  hand,  the  verbs  in  the  latter  halves  seem  to  represent  a  meaningful 
sequence or progression of movement towards the presence of the god: search-
ing for him, focusing upon him, standing before him, looking at him, all done in 
preparation for making a request from him (lines 19–23).

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This is the superscript, marking the 
beginning  of  the  ritual  wording.  It  is  not  part  of  the  prayer.  Bēlu,  “lord.”  Gašru,  “very 
strong, powerful.” Tizqāru, “exalted.” This adjective describes the god’s status (and not his 
strength) and thus modifies the nomen regens of the following construct chain and not the 
preceding noun. The pattern of this adjective is pitrāsu; our form is due to metathesis re-
sulting  from the  sibilant  z:  *zitqāru  >  tizqāru.  Bukru,  “son.”  In  Akkadian,  in  contrast  to 
biblical Hebrew, bukru is not limited to the firstborn.  dNunamnir, the father of Nergal, is 
here  a  name  of  Enlil.  The  name  reflects  that  god’s  authority:  Nu(n)-nam-nir,  “prince  of 
sovereignty” or “the one of sovereignty.”  
 
   
Line 2: In this line the composer brings together Nergal’s roles as ruling god of the 
netherword and as god of war. Ašarēdu, “foremost.” The Anunnakki here refer to the gods 
of the netherworld. EN = bēlu, see line 1. Tamḫāru, “battle, combat.” 
 
   
Line 3: Ilittu, “offspring.” dKutušar, a mother goddess, the mother of Nergal; here, it is 
probably a name of Ninlil. The name reflects that goddess’s function as a mother goddess 
(see the Sumerian myth Enlil and Ninlil, where Ninlil gives birth to Nanna, Nergal, Ninazu, 
and Enbilulu). Šarratu, “queen.” Rabû (m), rabītu (f), “great.” 
 
   
Line  4:  Kaškaššu,  “all  powerful.”  DINGIR.MEŠ  =  ilū,  “gods.”  Narāmu,  “beloved.”  The 
goddess Ninmena here is the wife of Nergal, though she appears elsewhere as his mother.   
 
   
Line 5: Šūpâta is a 2ms predicative of šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to be(come) manifest, bril-
liant.” Ina, “in.” Šamû, “heavens.” KÙ.MEŠ = ellūtu, “pure.” Šaqû, “to be(come) elevated.” 
Šaqu  is  the  3ms  predicative  form.  Manzāzu  (mazzāzu),  lit.  “position,  place  of  standing.” 
Here the word has the astral meaning “station, position” in the heavens, referring to Mars. 
Ina šamê ellūti (line 5) and ina arallî (line 6) are syntactically part of the first half of each 
line, but also apply to the second half.

lû, a name of the netherworld. Māḫiru, “rival, opponent.” Lā, “not.” Išû, “to have.” 
 

rabâta ina arallî māḫira lā tīšu 

Line 6: Rabû, “to be big, great.” Rabâta is the 2ms predicative form. É.KUR.ÚŠ = aral-

Line 7: Itti, “with.” Ea is god of wisdom, water, and magic (see page 227).  UKKIN = 
puḫru,  “assembly.”  Milku,  “counsel,  advice.”  Šūtur  is  a  3ms  predicative  of  šūturu  (Š  of 
[w]atāru), “to be preeminent.” In line 7, LKA 30 and PBS 1/2 119 (Mayer’s MSS F and G 
from Ashur and Babylonia, respectively) read  dA-ni7. In line 8, PBS 1/2 119 adds u  KI-tì, 
thus reading šamê u erṣeti. If we follow the main text of lines 7–8, then we have a chiastic 
arrangement a-b-bʹ-aʹ in lines 5–8: a. heaven (line 5); b. institution, i.e., netherworld (line 
6); bʹ. institution, i.e., council (line 7); aʹ. heaven (line 8). But the pattern in the variant 
texts (especially šamê u erṣeti in line 8) seems to be different. 

itti Ea ina puḫur ilī milikka šūtur 

Line 8: d30 = Sîn, the moon god (see page 385). Šeʾû, “to observe.” The form is a G 

   
2ms durative. Gimru, “totality, everything.” 
 

itti Sîn ina šamê tašeʾʾi gimri 

iddikkā-ma Ellil abūka ṣalmāt qaqqadi puḫur napišti 

 
Line  9:  Nadānu,  “to  give.”  The  signs  id-din-ka  present  a  morphographemic  writing. 
The final radical of the root assimilates into the initial consonant of the 2ms pronominal 
suffix, thus id-din-ka is transcribed iddikka. dEN.LÍL  = Ellil, the father of Nergal. Abu, “fa-
ther.” Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” refers to mankind. Napištu, “life.” 
 
   
Line 10: Būlu, “animals, livestock.” Šakkan was the divine protector of wild animals. 
Nammaššû (nammaštû), “wild animals.”  Qātu, “hand.” Qātukka is the  noun  qātu with the 
locative-adverbial ending (–um) plus a 2ms possessive suffix. Here, however, the locative 
ending has a terminative meaning, ana, “to(ward).” The m of the ending assimilates to the 
k of the 2ms pronominal suffix. Paqādu, “to entrust, to care for, to appoint.”

Line 11: Anāku, “I.” NENNI = annanna, “so-and-so.” A = māru, “son.” ÌR = ardu (war-
dum), “servant.” In place of the generic formula, “I (am) so-and-so, the son of so-and-so,

MS B adds the so-called attalû (“eclipse”) formula to the self-presentation formula, which 
names  Ashurbanipal  (see  Mayer,  UFBG,  100–102  for  a  brief  discussion).  MS  G  attests  a 
longer self-presentation, naming Shamash-shum-ukin, adds the attalû formula but without 
the  line  mentioning  the  eclipse  (see  UFBG,  101,  n.65),  and  also  includes  a  sterotypical 
lament and petition for the removal of the evil (UFBG, 73–75 and 265–69).  

anāku annanna mār annanna aradka 

   
Line 12: Šibsātu, “anger,” is a feminine plural. The construct form is šibsāt. Note the 
plural form of the verb. IŠ8.DAR = ištaru, “goddess.” Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed,” 
here “to beset.” The form iššaknūnim is a 3mp preterite with a 1cs dative suffix. This line is 
omitted  in  MS  G.  The  omission  comes  immediately  after  the  introduction  of  Shamash-
shum-ukin as the speaker of the text and the request that the evil portended by signs not 
affect the palace and land. The omission may be due to the fact that when the scribe intro-

duced these matters in place of line 11, he dropped line 12 accidentally—if so, then lines 
11 and 12 were probably written on one line in his Vorlage. (A less likely explanation is 
that the evil signs mentioned in this insertion were meant to replace “the anger of the god 
and goddess” as the cause of the difficulties described in lines 13 and 14.) 
 
   
Line 13: ZI.GA = ṣītu, “expenses.” Ḫuluqqû (ḫuluqqāʾu), “losses.” Nabšû (N of bašû), “to 
befall, to occur.” The form is a 3mp preterite. É = bītu, “house.” MU = “my,” the 1cs pos-
sessive suffix in  Sumerian. It may represent  either the Akk.  pronominal suffix –ya or  –ī, 
depending on the case of the noun to which it is attached. 
 
   
Line 14: Qabû: “to speak, to command.” Šemû, “to hear, to listen.” Both forms are G 
infinitives, nom. case. The inf. is neutral in regard to voice; hence, šemû should be under-
stood as “to be heard” (passive) and not “to hear” (active). Nadlupu (N of dalāpu), “to keep 
awake” (transitive). The form is a 3mp preterite with a 1cs accusative pronominal suffix.

Line 15: The opening hemistichs of lines 15, 16, 17, and 18 all contain aššum + ad-
jectival forms serving as predicates, which describe a permanent feature of the divine ad-
dressee. The closing hemistichs of  lines 15, 16,  17, and 18 all contain  1cs perfect verbs 
with either a 2ms object pronominal suffix or an accusative noun plus 2ms possessive pro-
nominal suffix. Aššum, “because, on account of.” Gammalu, “very merciful, gracious, spar-
ing.” The adjective is predicative (2ms); see also the forms in lines 16 and 17. Saḫāru, “to 
turn (toward).” Assaḫur is a 1cs perfect (see also the forms in lines 16–18). The t has assim-
ilated to the s. DINGIR-ut = ilūtu, “godhead, divinity.”  

aššum gammalāta bēlī Nergal assaḫur ilūtka  

Line 16: Tayyāru, “compassionate.” Šeʾû, “to seek.” The form is 1cs perfect with a 2ms 

   
object suffix.

Line 17: All of the MSS but one transposes our lines 17 and 18. I follow, however, MS 
B, in which these lines are ordered as above because muppalsāta of our line 18 should lead 
directly to naplisannī-ma of line 19. The reading re-mé-né-ta follows MS A. Rēmēnû, “merci-
ful.” Izuzzu, “to stand.” Maḫarka, “before you.”

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

In 2 Kgs 17:24 the people of Cutha are said to have been settled in Samaria 
subsequent to the conquest and deportation of northern Israel, and in v. 30 the 
people  of  Cutha  are  described  as  worshipping  Nergal.  In  Jer  39:3,  13  Nergal 
appears in the PN 
, Nergal-sar-ezer, an official of the Babylonian king 
(for the name, see HALOT, 723b). Nergal is identified with the western Resheph 
(see  Wiggermann,  216,  218,  222),  a  god  of  battle,  death,  and  disease,  who  is 
armed  with  bow  and  arrow. Resheph  appears  in  demonic  form  in  the  Hebrew 
Bible as the personification of pestilence (see Deut 32:24, Hab 3:5, and Job 5:7).  
For points of specific interest in the Hebrew Bible and later Hebrew, I note 
the following:  With arallû (line 6) compare  ל ֵאי ִר ֲא /  ל ֵא ְר ַה in Ezek 43:15, which 
Albright  thought  was  a  loan  word  from  arallû  (see  HALOT,  87b).  With  Enlil’s 
placing of animals under the control of Nergal (lines 9–10) compare Ps  8:7–9, 
especially v. 8. For ṣītu u ḫuluqqu (line 13), “expenses and losses,” compare later 
Hebrew 
,  as  well  as  Aramaic  אתקפנ  and  אתדבא.  With  the  descrip-
tions  of  the  deity  in  the  first  hemistichs  in  lines  15–18,  gammalāta,  tayyārāta, 
rēmēnêta, muppalsāta,  compare  respectively  Hebrew  ןוּנ ָח  למג,  בושׁ/חלס,  םוּח ָר,  and

NISABA: 

ӎӎ 

A Shuilla: Nisaba 1 

CHRISTOPHER FRECHETTE 

In the Mesopotamian pantheon, Nisaba was the goddess of grain and of the 
scribal arts and was accorded familial associations with several major gods. The 
Sumerogram dNISABA can signify either this goddess’s name or a general term for 
grain. Nisaba was considered the oldest child of Enlil and a daughter of Urash, 
ancestor of Anu. In first millennium texts, she was considered a daughter of Anu 
or Ea, and therefore an aunt or sister of Marduk. In the Ur III and OB periods, 
her  spouse  was  Ḫaya,  but  in  the  first  millennium  Nabu  was  considered  her 
spouse, apparently because of their shared association with the scribal arts.1 In 
the OB period, Nabu and Nisaba are attested as personal gods of scribes.2 A tab-
let  found  at  the  site  of  the  Temple  of  Nabu  at  Nimrud  (CTN  IV,  no.  168)  and 
identified by a note on its left edge as “shuillas of great and exalted goddesses” 
contains seven prayers with ritual instructions to four goddesses (Nisaba, Ishtar, 
Tashmetu,  and  Nanaya),  their  common  characteristic  being  a  spousal  or  love 
relationship to Nabu.3 The first two prayers on the tablet are to Nisaba, the first 
of which is the present prayer.  

The cult of Nisaba, about which there is little information, dates as early as 
the ED period and seems to have  been  limited primarily to Nippur, where she 
was  worshipped  at the temple  of  her  daughter  Ninlil;  no  temples  dedicated to 
her are yet attested.4 Despite the fact that her status seems to have waned by the

2  Anne Löhnert and Annette Zgoll, “Schutzgott. A. In Mesopotamien,” RlA 12 (2009), 313. 
3  While Nabu was considered a spouse of Nisaba in the late period, Nabu’s more long-standing 
consorts were initially Tashmetu and later Nanaya (see Francesco Pomponio, “Nabû. A. Philolo-
gisch,” RlA 9 [1998–2001], 16–24). Nanaya, the goddess of erotic love and the mistress of Nabu, 
belonged  to  the  circle  of Ishtar,  with  whom  she  was  at  some  points  syncretized  (Marten  Stol, 
“Nanaja,”  RlA  9  [1998–2001],  146–51).  In  Nabu’s  home  city  of  Borsippa,  both  Nanaya  and 
Tashmetu  were  identified  as  “queens  of  Borsippa”  (Paul-Alain  Beaulieu,  The  Pantheon  of  Uruk 
During the Neo-Babylonian Period [Cuneiform Monographs 23; Leiden/Boston: Brill/Styx, 2003],

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

OB  period,  her  association  with  writing  and  grain  remained.  As  with  Nabu,  a 
stylus  served  as  her  emblem.5  At  present,  while  no  iconographic  depiction  of 
Nisaba can be identified with certainty, it is possible that among representations 
of deities associated with vegetation, e.g., anthropomorphic figures with branch-
es above their shoulders or in their hands, some may depict her.6 

Nisaba  was  not  included  among  the  elite  of  the  Mesopotamian  pantheon. 
Nevertheless,  combined  with  her  familial  relationships  to  Ea,  Enlil,  and  Nabu, 
the associations of Nisaba with grain and with the scribal arts suggest that she 
was regarded as wielding significant influence among the gods. Indeed, her abil-
ity  to  influence  other  deities is  central  to  the  present prayer.  For,  as  do many 
Akkadian shuilla-prayers of the āšipu, this prayer asks a deity to intercede with 
other deities, specifically the client’s personal god and goddess, in order to gain 
forgiveness and reconciliation. Grain was the most important food for people in 
Mesopotamian society, and consequently it was the most important type of offer-
ing in Mesopotamian rituals.7 Moreover, feeding a deity was understood to ren-
der him or her receptive to petition. Since the gods were believed to rely on food 
offerings,  and  since  grain  was  the  most  important  of  these,  the  grain  used  to 
pacify  the  gods  through  offerings  ritually  manifested  her  influential  capacity. 
Her association with the scribal arts linked her influence to the enactment of this 
ritual prayer. Vital throughout Mesopotamian culture, the scribal arts held par-
ticular importance  for ritual experts. Written records allowed these scholars to 
preserve for their use the sacred traditions of the very ritual prayers and actions 
employed to engage the gods properly in order to gain their favor.  

THE PRAYER: 

Nisaba 1 provides a window into the multi-faceted rationale by which ele-
ments of ritual functioned in first-millennium Mesopotamian religion. Based on 
its language, literary  form,  classifying  rubric,  and  inclusion  within  the  craft  of 
the āšipu, this ritual-prayer may be classified as an Akkadian shuilla.8 Typical of 
such  ritual-prayers,  it  functioned  in  part  to  gain  the  intercession  of  Nisaba  in 
reconciling personal gods and speaker. However, the instructions describing the 
context of its recitation indicate that it functioned also to prepare a material for 
use  in  ritual  activity,  a  function  atypical  of  Akkadian  shuillas  but  found  in  a 
number  of  incantations  which  modern  scholars  have  called  Kultmittelbeschwör-
ungen  (see  page  29).  Blending  both  functions  this  ritual-prayer  manifests  the 
powerful influence of Nisaba for reconciling individuals with their angry deities.

8  As  explained  in the  general  introduction,  in  this  book the  term “shuilla”  refers to the  ritual 
prayer  as  a  whole,  including  the  recited  text  and  associated  ritual  activity;  the  term  “shuilla-
prayer” refers specifically to the text of the prayer. 

 

 

ӎӎ A SHUILLA: NISABA 1

Its four known exemplars and two texts preserving its incipit, all date to the first 
millennium  and  come  from  diverse  locations,  including  Nineveh,  Sippar,  and 
Kalḫu.9  

The first part of the classifying rubric appended to this prayer fits the typi-
cal form for this class of shuilla-prayer: “wording of a ‘lifted-hand’ to DN” (ka-
inim-ma šu-íl-la(2) dDN-ke4). The term “lifted-hand” in this context likely refers to 
the  composite  ritual  activity  of  spoken  words  and  attendant  actions  among 
which a gesture of hand-lifting was likely assumed by the ritual specialist (see 
discussion in the introduction,  p. 35). While most such classifying rubrics con-
clude with the name of the deity, both of the exemplars of this prayer that are 
not broken away after the name of the goddess continue by clarifying that it is 
“for turning away divine anger” (dingir-šà-dib-ba gur-ru-da-kám). This Sumerian 
phrase identifies a class of ritual-prayers of the āšipu that are typically addressed 
to the personal deities whose anger is at issue (see the discussion in the intro-
duction, page 40).10 The present prayer, like the other Akkadian shuilla-prayers, 
is not directed to a personal deity but to one of the “high gods,” and like many 
of them asks Nisaba to intercede with the speaker’s angry personal gods. Since 
Akkadian shuillas commonly declare the petitioner’s desire to be reconciled with 
angry deities, the rubric’s inclusion of the words “for turning away divine anger” 
may be interpreted as emphasizing or further specifying the purpose of this par-
ticular shuilla-prayer. Such additional identifying rubrics, while rare, are attest-
ed among Akkadian shuillas. (See page 29 in the introduction.) 

Like other shuilla-prayers, which range from twenty to thirty lines in length, 
Nisaba 1 includes several standard elements in typical sequence but is relatively 
short. Four lines of address characterize the deity (lines 1–4), three lines of peti-
tion seek her intercession to reconcile personal deities with the client (lines 5–
7), and three lines seek forgiveness of the client’s sins (lines 14–16). The prayer 
concludes with a single line offering to praise the goddess (line 17).  

One exemplar, our MS A, which is in NB script and was apparently written 
for a specific occasion, includes an insertion of several formulaic elements after 
the section seeking reconciliation: an identification of the speaker as Shamash-
shum-ukin  (lines  8–9),11  a  complaint  concerning  omens  portending  evil  fates 
 
9  Since a new  edition of this prayer is in press and not yet available  at the time of writing, a 
summary of the textual witnesses is in order. The four exemplars of this prayer are MS A = BM 
78219; MS B = K.6028; MS C = K.3392; MS D = ND 5493 = IM 67630. Two texts preserve only 
the incipit: MS E = BM 122647 and MS F = K.2798+. In the current transliteration and transla-
tion, lines 1–13 follow MS A; line 14 completes MS C with MS D; line 15 follows MS D; lines 16–17 
follow MS C; and lines 18–19 complete MS C with MS D. 
10  W. G. Lambert, “DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” JNES 33 (1974), 267–322.  
11  Shamash-shum-ukin,  whose  name  means  “Shamash  has  firmly  established  a  name”  (Akk. 
Šamaš-šum-ukīn), reigned as king of Babylon from 667–648 BCE. He was a son of Esarhaddon and 
older  brother of Ashurbanipal  and succeeded to the throne of Babylon  after the death  of  their 
father in 669 BCE. Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria from 668–c.630 BCE, began fighting to supplant 
Shamash-shum-ukin  in  652  BCE;  the  latter  died  (or  was  killed)  in  648  BCE.  See  Grant  Frame, 
“Šamaš-šuma-ukīn,” RlA 11 (2008), 618–21.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

(lines 10–11), and a petition for protection from those fates (lines 12–13). Based 
on this exemplar alone, the end of which is broken, we cannot know the precise 
ritual  context  of  that  occasion.  However,  considerable  evidence  indicates  that 
shuilla-rituals were sometimes carried out in conjunction with namburbi-rituals, 
whose  explicit  purpose  was  to  dissolve  the  calamitous  fate  portended  by  an 
omen (see the introduction, page 36). Such may have been the case for this ex-
emplar.  

The complaint in lines 10–11 is a variation on a formulaic expression of con-
cern over unfavorable omens.12 Such a complaint is usually followed by one or 
more statements in which the speaker expresses fear, turns to the deity, requests 
the deity’s attention, or petitions for help. In MS A, however, such a statement is 
absent.  Consequently,  the  element  of  complaint  takes  the  form  of  a  lengthy 
prepositional phrase that is grammatically subordinate to the petition:

This sentence is comprehensible, but awkward. An exemplar of the prayer Ner-
gal  2  contains  a  nearly  identical  insertion  which  also  names  Shamash-shum-
ukin, but that exemplar adds a line to the complaint-element.13 As a result, the 
complaint is no longer couched in a subordinate prepositional phrase, but forms 
a complete sentence expressing the king’s anxiety: 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

not come close, not reach me!

  As a result of (ina) [the evil omens]

  I am afraid, anxious, and panicked. 
  May their evil towards me and my palace 

 
 
12  While Werner Mayer includes this complaint formula among exemplars of the so-called “attalû 
formula” concerning a lunar eclipse that portends evil for the king’s palace and land, the present 
insertion  lacks  the  formula’s  first  line,  which  mentions  the  eclipse  (UFBG,  100–102).  Of  the 
twenty-eight occurrences of this formula  noted by Mayer, twenty-four occur in shuilla-prayers; 
occurrences in the present insertion and in one exemplar of Nergal 2 are the only two in which 
the first line, which mentions the eclipse, does not occur. (For a list of all exemplars of this for-
mula see UFBG, 100, n. 64. For a transliteration of the insertion in this exemplar of Nergal 2, see 
UFBG, 480, Text G, lines 12ʹ–18ʹ and page 344 in this book.) Moreover, Mayer describes another 
complaint formula that is strikingly similar to the attalû formula, but it lacks the line concerning 
the eclipse altogether and refers to evil that threatens the ordinary person’s house and person, 
not the king’s palace (Formula α, UFBG, 102–3). The self-identification formula, which may or 
may not immediately precede either of these two complaint formulas, may function either as a 
subject for what follows or as an independent clause (see UFBG, 46–52).

ӎӎ A SHUILLA: NISABA 1 

355

The insertion as it appears in Nergal 2 avoids the dubious syntax of Nisaba 1 and 
clarifies the logical connection between the king’s predicament and his petition. 
Moreover, this additional line, palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, constitutes a stock 
phrase found in parallel formulas in many Akkadian shuilla-prayers and so was 
arguably omitted by mistake. Consequently, it makes sense to restore this line. 

In most cases, an Akkadian shuilla would have been carried out “in front of” 
(ina/ana maḫar) a deity manifest either in its astral form or in the form of a cult 
image or standard.14 The three exemplars of the full text of Nisaba 1 for which 
the end of the prayer is preserved all include the same brief ritual instruction: 
the prayer is to be recited not to the deity by name but to a certain type of inex-
pensive flour (maṣḫatu) used almost exclusively for ritual offerings.15 This flour, 
then, was presumably identified as a manifestation of the goddess Nisaba. 

The ritual instructions on the preserved exemplars of Nisaba 1 only indicate 
recitation  of  the  prayer  to  the  flour.  As  in  any  written  ritual  instruction  from 
Mesopotamia, however, one ought not to presume that ritual actions were lim-
ited to what is written. Indeed, flour as a ritual offering was typically scattered 
(sarāqu)  either  upon  a  censer  or  the  animal  offering  and  could  be mixed  with 
other ingredients such as water or oil before being poured.16 A similar but more 
detailed instruction  for the  recitation  of  this  prayer in  the ritual  tablet for  the 
elaborate Bīt salāʾ mê (“house of water-sprinkling”) royal ritual confirms such a 
usage.17 The ritual instructions call first for setting up an altar and for making an 
offering in front of maṣḫatu-flour and then for the recitation of Nisaba 1. After 
the making  of  an  offering  to the planet Jupiter  (which  is  identified  with  Mar-
duk), the same maṣḫatu-flour is poured out or scattered, presumably as part of 
the offering to Jupiter/Marduk. 

As mentioned above, although Nisaba 1 is addressed to maṣḫatu-flour, nei-
ther  the  prayer  nor  its  ritual  activity  fits  neatly  with  what  is  typical  of 
Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Rather, evidence for the ritual context of Nisaba 1 in Bīt 
 
14  Ritual instructions appended to copies of shuilla-prayers vary greatly in the degree of detail 
given and in many cases do not identify the deity before whom the prayer is recited or the offer-
ing set up. However, when  the  recipient of an  offering or prayer  is  indicated,  it is typically  a 
name  for  the  deity  addressed  in  the  prayer.  Some  Mesopotamian  deities  have  more  than  one 
name. For instance, the god Ea may also be referred to as Enlilbanda (see page 227).

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

salāʾ mê, strengthened by its likely similar context in an additional royal ritual,18 
illuminates the way in which this prayer blended functionality typical of Akka-
dian  shuilla-prayers  with  that  of  Kultmittelbeschwörungen.  Nisaba’s  presumed 
influence  over  other  gods 
the 
Kultmittelbeschwörungen,  which  included  descriptions  of  the  special  qualities  of 
the objects addressed,19 Nisaba 1 is directed to a material that is then manipu-
lated in a ritual. However, the words addressed to the maṣḫatu-flour do not de-
scribe its material qualities but rather name anthropomorphic characteristics of 
the  goddess,  as  do  many  shuilla-prayers;  she  is  “merciful,”  she  “creates  god, 
king, and human,” she “reconciles angry gods to humans.”20  

in  both  respects.  Like 

is  manifested 

The image of Nisaba as a “net” (saparru, line 3) capable of making angry de-
ities relent captures well the influence of this deity. A saparru is attested as being 
spread out or thrown in order to capture and pacify an opposing deity. This im-
age provides a link between the anthropomorphic images of Nisaba and the ma-
terial  manifestation  of  the  goddess  as  flour,  which,  like  such  a  net,  is  cast  to-
wards the deity. The recital of Nisaba 1 in conjunction with ritual scattering of 
maṣḫatu-flour as an offering would have manifested influence to calm angry dei-
ties.  In  Bīt  salāʾ  mê  this  ritual-prayer  would  have  rendered  Jupiter/Marduk, 
widely attested as a furious warrior, calm and amenable to interceding for the 
king in order to reconcile him with his personal gods. It begins there a lengthy 
sequence of shuillas to the gods of Nippur and Babylon that continues through 
the night intended to gain also their intercession on the king’s behalf. It is possi-
ble  that  at  least  some  of  the  offerings  in  the  subsequent  lengthy  sequence  of 
shuilla-rituals in Bīt salāʾ mê might also have included maṣḫatu-flour and, if so, 
would have further manifested Nisaba’s influence. 
 
18  Noting that  the  colophon to  MS C  identifies it with the royal  ritual complex  Bīt rimki,  Cecil  
Mullo-Weir argued that Nisaba 1 may be restored as initiating the lengthy sequence of shuillas in 
one version of that complex (BBR 26+), where, as in Bīt salāʾ mê, it is followed immediately by a 
shuilla to Marduk (“The Prayer Cycle in the Assyrian Ritual bît rimki, Tablet IV,” AfO 18 [1957–
1958], 371–72).

und Recht in Mesopotamien: Festschrift für Claus Wilcke (ed. W. Sallaberger, K.Volk, and A. Zgoll; 
Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003), 1–14, here 3–4. 
20  Moreover,  in  Bīt salāʾ  mê, Nisaba  1  differs from the sequence of ten Kultmittelbeschwörungen 
which  immediately  precede  it  in  that  none  of  them  include  instructions  for  the  making  of  an 
offering to the materials to which they are addressed. Yet, an offering is made to the maṣḫatu-
flour in conjunction with the recitation of Nisaba 1.

Line  1:  ÉN  in  many  cases  marks  the  beginning  of  wording  to  be  recited  in  rituals; 
while it is often equated by scholars with šiptu, “incantation,” it is not clear that the scribes 
read the word as Akkadian. They may have simply understood it as a Sumerian word. In 
any case, it is not part of the prayer itself. dNISABA (dŠE.NAGA; also read dNIDABA) can signify 
either a general term for grain or the goddess Nisaba. The NAGA sign originally depicted a 
plant, possibly barley, and the ŠE sign may have originally represented a spike of grain. 
Šarratu, “queen.” Ḫumālu is a rare term of uncertain meaning. Neither the CAD (Ḫ, 234) 
nor  Seux  (339)  offers  a  translation.  Wolfram  von  Soden  has  suggested  that  behind  this 
term  stands  the  Heb.  (Canaanite)  ל ַמ ָח,  “to  have  compassion”  (“Bemerkungen  zu  einigen 
literarischen Texten in akkadischer Sprache aus Ugarit,” UF 1 [1969], 191). This view is 
reflected in AHw, which glosses ḫumalīti as “freundliche”? (355a) but offers a correction, 
glossing ḫumālu  as “Mitleid [compassion]”? (1562a). The CDA  reflects both  possibilities, 
glossing ḫumalīti as “friendly, sympathetic”? (120). Following Hrůša’s edition, the present 
form is here taken as a denominative adjective (“merciful”) in a form referred to as “nisbe” 
(the term is borrowed from Arabic grammar), in which -ī is added to the base of the noun 
(see Huehnergard, §6.2; GAG, §56 q). The case vowel is i, rather than the expected u of the 
nominative, but case endings in texts from the late period are often arbitrary.  

šiptu: Nisaba šarratu ḫumalīti 
 Line 2: While DÙ may indicate either banû or epēšu, context here suggests the former. 
Banû, “to create.” The form is a fs participle in construct with the following three terms 
(all gen.). DINGIR = ilu, “god.” LUGAL = šarru, “king.” NAM.LÚ.U18.LU = amīlūtu (awīlūtum), 
“mankind, humanity.”  

bānât ili šarri u amīlūti 

Line 3: Saparru, “net, throw-net.” This term is attested as a kind of (divine) weapon 
which was “spread out” (šuparruru or tarāṣu) in order to capture and pacify a raging hos-
tile deity (see CAD S, 161; CAD Š/3, 317–18). Such use of a saparru is attributed to Nisaba, 
e.g.,  saparru  ša  Nisaba  liksûšu,  “May  Nisaba’s  net  ensnare  him”  (cited  by  CAD  S,  161). 
Hammurabi also describes himself  as  sapar  nakirī “enemy-ensnaring throw-net” (Laws  of 
Hammurabi ii 68; Martha Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor [2d ed.; 
SBLWAW 6; Scholars Press: Atlanta, 1997], 78). Depicting Nisaba as a net for constraining 
an opponent provides a significant link between words and ritual action. It not only corre-
sponds with the request in the present prayer that Nisaba pacify the speaker’s angry per-
sonal deities, it also mirrors the ritual activity of pouring or sprinkling of flour as a ritual 
offering. The last two words in the line form a phrase in apposition to Anunnakkī. Anun-
nakkū is often left untranslated. In earlier Sum. texts the term referred to the gods, espe-

sapar Anunnakkī ilī ekdūti 

Line 4: Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to bring about peace, reconciliation; to cause to re-
lent.” This participle is in construct with the following four words, all of which are in the 
gen.  Zenû  (ms),  zenītu  (fs),  “angry.”  While  one  would  not  ordinarily  expect  a  construct 
chain to be interrupted by adjectives, this rule is sometimes violated. MS A ze-na-a, MS D 
ze-ne-e: the case vowel â in MS A is an apparently erroneous accusative case; the case vow-
el ê in MS D reflects the Assyrian genitive ending –e (rather than the Babylonian –i). Ištaru, 
“goddess.” While  the  Sumerogram  d15  may indicate  the name  of  the  goddess  Ishtar,  the 
name  of  this  divinity  also  became  a  general  appellative  for  “goddess,”  as  in  the  typical 
phrase “god and goddess.” Ze-ni-t[u4]: Only MS A preserves the ending here, which errone-
ously indicates the case vowel u rather than the expected i. 

musallimat ila zenâ ištara zenītu 

Line 5: Šapāru, “to send.” The form is a 1cs precative with a 2fs pronominal suffix. Af-
ter the preposition ana the nouns and adjectives are all in the genitive; both nouns have 
pronominal  suffixes  1cs  (indicated  by  MU).  Having  described  pertinent  characteristics  of 
Nisaba in lines 1–4, the speaker now begins the petition using language echoing that de-
scription. 

lušpurki ana ilīya zenî ištarīya zenīti 

Line 6: Ša introduces a relative clause. While one might take the following two forms, 
as well as zenû to be adjectives, they are more likely predicative constructions (statives) 
with the subordination (or subjunctive) marker –u. Kamālu, “to be(come) angry, wrathful.” 
Šabāsu, “to be angry, furious.” Libbu, “heart.” The –ma here, which occurs in only one of 
the  two  preserved  MSS,  may  serve  as  a  conjunction  or  have an  emphatic  or  topicalizing 
function (see GAG §123a). Zenû, “to be angry.” KI = itti, “with.” KI.MU = ittīya, “with me.” 
While  these predicative constructions are single in agreement with the  subject  libbu,  the 
translation should reflect plurality: “whose hearts are wrathful, furious and angry.” 

ša kamlu šabsu libbašunū-ma zenû ittīya 

Line 7: Sullumu, see line 4. Sullimī is a D fs impv. plus ventive. The –ma is emphatic. 
Of the four MSS preserving DINGIR here, only  MS A adds  MEŠ, and this need not indicate a 
plural.  Assyriologists  generally  recognize that in  some  nominal forms  MEŠ  has  become a 
frozen form; thus, Borger notes that in nominal forms, MEŠ may be meaningless (MZL, no. 
754, 420). Since u may serve as the case vowel for the accusative as well as the nomina-
tive in SB, and seeing that  of the four terms requiring an accusative ending in this line,

8–13, an insertion comprised of a sequence of formulas found only in MS A, see the discus-
sion under THE PRAYER. Self-presentation formulas, such as that in lines 8–9, may function 
as an independent clause or as a subject for what follows (see Mayer, UFBG, 46–52).  

anāku Šamaš-šum-ukīn mār ilīšu 

Line 9: Ša introduces a relative clause. Marduk (= dAMAR.UTU), the ruling god of Bab-
ylon, and his spouse Zarpanitu are here named as the personal god and goddess of Sha-
mash-shum-ukin, the Babylonian king. 

ša ilšu Marduk ištaršu Zarpānītu 

Line 10: Ina, “as a result of.” ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, misfortune, calamity.” Á.MEŠ = idāti 
and GISKIM.MEŠ = ittāti are often taken as alternate gen. fp forms of ittu, “omen, ominous 
sign.” However, the two terms, although identical in semantic range, represent two differ-
ent  bases  itta- and  idat-  (see  CAD  I/J,  309–10).  For  a  detailed  linguistic and  conceptual 
treatment  of  ittu  as  Omenanzeiger  [omen-announcer]  and  idātu  as  “die  (fein)materiell 
gedachte ‘Abstrahlung’ des Omenanzeigers [the (subtly) tangible ‘radiation’ of the omen-
announcer],” see Maul, ZB, 6–7. ḪUL = lemnu, “inauspicious, ill-boding, dangerous.” NU = 
lā, “not.”  DÙG.GA = ṭābu, “auspicious, favorable.” The syntax of this line is clear, but its 
meaning depends on  one’s understanding of how omens  operated. Lumun  is  in construct 
with idāti and ittāti, and the adjectives lemnēti lā ṭābāti may be taken to modify ittāti or both 
idāti and ittāti. Stefan Maul takes both the adjectives in this phrase, which occurs frequent-
ly in namburbis, as modifying both nouns: “Die bösen, unguten idātu und ittātu [The evil, 
no-good  idātu  and  ittātu]”  (ZB,  6  n.41).  Seux’s  translation  of  the  line  inserts  an  implied 
verb  and  a  relative  pronoun:  “[Quant  au  mal]  (qu’annoncent)  les  signes  et  les  présages 
mauvais,  défavorables”  (340).  Thus,  Seux  takes  the  construct  chain  lumun  idāti  ittāti  to 
imply,  “the  evil  that  the  signs  and  evil,  unfavorable  portents  announce.”  Mayer  also  as-
sumes  that  signs  and  portents  announce  evil,  but  his  translation  does  not  represent  the 
Akkadian syntax literally, taking lemnēti lā ṭābāti as what is being announced: “bei/wegen 
dem Übel von Vorzeichen und Anzeichen, die Schlechtes und Unheil (verkünden) [because 
of  the  evil  of  the  signs  and  portents,  (which  announce)  something  bad  and  disaster]” 
(UFBG,  103).  While  Seux  and  Mayer  agree  that  in  the  Mesopotamian  worldview  omens 
announce events, Maul clarifies that omens there “announce” not only by indicating a por-
tended event, but by activating it in a concrete way (ZB, 5).

Line 11: Ša introduces a relative clause whose antecedent is idāti ittāti. É.GAL = ekallu, 
“palace.”  KUR  = mātu, “land.”  GÁL.MEŠ =  bašû, “to  occur.” While the  MEŠ sign in verbal 
logograms can signify the plural or an iterative stem (Borger, MZL, no. 754, 420), the pre-
sent  normalization  is  based  on  the  syllabic  spelling  ib-šá-a-ma  in the  parallel  formula  in 
Nergal 2 discussed in the introduction to the prayer (see Mayer, UFBG, 480, Text G: 15′). 
The text following the line is restored after a formula occurring in that same parallel text 
(see discussion under THE PRAYER). Palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am anxious (palāḫu), I 
am afraid (adāru), and I am panicked (Št adāru).” All three forms are 1cs predicative con-
structions (statives). For this formulary, see also Mayer, UFBG, 73.  

ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ / 〈palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku〉 
 Line 12: The pronominal suffix on lumnu,  BI = –šina, refers back to idāti ittāti. Note 
that the n of the noun assimilates to the š of the suffix. Ayyâši, “towards me,” is a form of 
the 1cs dative pronoun to which the preposition ana has assimilated (ayyâši < ana yâši, cf. 
GAG, §41 j 2). IA-ši is taken here as ayyâši since the É.G[AL-ia] which follows it demands 
the preposition ana (see Mayer, UFBG, 267). For the possibility of reading IA as ay(y)V, see 
Werner Mayer, “Besonderheiten  in der Verwendung des Graphems  A.A im Akkadischen,” 
Or n.s. 72 (2003), 293–306, at 305–6. While the translation given below may be read am-
biguously, it is important to recognize that the prepositional phrase, “towards me and my 
palace,” modifies the series of verbs in the following line, not the subject, “their evil.” 

lumuššina ayyâši u ekallīya 

Line 13: TE = ṭeḫû, “to come near to, to approach.” DIM4 = sanāqu, “to check, to ap-
proach, to come near.” KU.NU = qerēbu, “to approach, to come close to.” KUR = kašādu, “to 
reach, to arrive, to conquer.” All of these verbs are vetitives (prefix ayy– plus the preter-
ite), that is, negative commands.  

ayy-iṭḫâm ayy-isniq ayy-iqrib ayy-ikšudanni 

Line 14: Annu is an alternative form of arnu, “guilt, fault, offense, penalty.” Napšuru 
(N of pašāru), “to be released, freed.” MSS B and C have lip-pa-áš-ru; MS D has lip-pá-aṭ?-ru 
(N stem of paṭāru, for which see line 15). Gillatu, “sin, sacrilege, crime, misdeed.” In view 
of the following verb (a 3fp precative), this noun is plural. Nanbuku (N of abāku), “to be 
taken away.”

Line 16: Paṭāru is a G inf. here, meaning “releasing” (thus, “absolution”). It is bound 
to the following noun, eʾiltīya. These two words form a genitive (construct) chain, which is 
the object of the following verb. Naqbû (N of qabû), “to be spoken, commanded.” In pray-
ers, the request that the deity “speak” or “command” what the speaker desires reflects the 
view  that  the divine  word was effective  for determining events  (see Mayer,  UFBG, 297–
306). The remainder of this line is not well preserved in any of the textual witnesses. The 
reading šumu (= MU), “name, repute, fame,” is possible but uncertain because of missing 
context. The presence of šumka could indicate that the second half of this line begins the 
typical element of the promise of praise. While šumu is not well attested in typical phrases 
in the context of a “promise to praise,” Mayer identifies the expression šuma ullulu in this 
context, interpreting it, “to let the name shine brightly” (UFBG, 340).

Line 17: Narbû, “great deeds,” pl. of narbû “greatness.” This form may be read as sin-

(UFBG, 320) and Maul (ZB, 418/420, line 20) take it as a plural meaning “great deeds.” MS

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
In  light  of  the  function  of  this  ritual-prayer  to  Nisaba,  who  is  manifested 
both  mythically  as  an  influential  goddess  who  makes  angry  deities  relent  and 
concretely  in the maṣḫatu-flour employed  within  the  ritual,  I  begin these  com-
parative suggestions with a discussion of grain and grain offerings in the Bible. 
 
In the agrarian societies of the ancient Near East, grain was the fundamental 
building block of the economy and the main medium of taxation.1 In Mesopota-
mia, grain was the most important among human foods and among ritual food 
offerings for the gods; it was offered in the form of bread, cereal products, por-
ridge, and flour.2 As flour, it was typically scattered (sarāqu) either upon a cen-
ser or upon the burnt animal offering and could be mixed with other ingredients 
such as water or oil before being poured.3 Among libations, beer made from bar-
ley or emmer-wheat was very common. 

While  the  Mesopotamians  identified  grain  with  Nisaba,  the  Bible  depicts 
Yahweh  as  responsible  for  providing  it.  Deuteronomy  identifies  abundance  of 
grain as among the blessings assured by Yahweh in response to covenant loyalty 
(Deut 7:13) and the lack of grain resulting in the people’s destruction as among 
the curses for covenant infidelity (Deut 28:51). Psalm 65:9–13 offers a lyric de-
scription of the Israelite god’s intimate involvement in bringing forth an abun-
dant harvest of grain. The Bible also portrays grain as an offering given to the 
deity. In the Priestly material of the Pentateuch, the term 
 ְנ ִמה ָח , which otherwise 
in BH may simply signify “gift,” specifies “cereal offering.”4 Leviticus 2:1–16 and 
6:7–11  describe  an  array  of  cereal  offerings,  all  of  which  combine  fine  flour 
(ת ֶלֹס)  and  oil  but  contain  no  leaven;  they  may  take  the  shape  of  unleavened 
cakes or wafers and may be baked or cooked on a griddle or in a pan. A portion 
of each is “turned into smoke” (hiphil of רטק) with frankincense as an offering to 
Yahweh,  and  the  remainder  of  each  is  then  given  to  the  priests.  Thus,  in  the 
Priestly  material  as  in  Mesopotamia,  and  in  particular  as  we  may  understand 
offerings accompanying Nisaba 1,  various forms of food made from flour were 
offered ritually by burning. While the Priestly material specifies cooking or bak-
ing  of  these  foods  prior  to  offering  them,  the  Mesopotamian  sources  allow  for 
offering flour, perhaps mixed with oil or water, directly.

ӎӎ A SHUILLA: NISABA 1 

363

The explicit purpose  of Nisaba 1 in conjunction with grain offerings as an 
appeal for help in calming angry gods finds only indirect parallels in the story of 
Noah and in the sacrificial system of the Priestly writings. 

In the Priestly system, if sacrifices and offerings to Yahweh can be said to 
have a pacifying function, it is with an emphasis on their capacity to please the 
deity rather than on the necessity of calming divine anger. Many biblical narra-
tives and prayers acknowledge Yahweh’s anger, but the use of offerings to calm 
this  anger  is  not  addressed  in  the  Priestly  sacrificial  system.  While  sinful  acts 
may  have  been  presumed  to  anger  the  deity,  sin  offerings  are  not  explicitly 
characterized as calming divine anger.  

More specifically, one view of Leviticus 1–3 supports the possibility that the 
grain offerings described in Leviticus 2 might have been applied in a variety of 
situations, including times of distress which could well have been attributed to 
divine  anger.  In  both  Mesopotamian  and  biblical  sources,  cereal  offerings  are 
inexpensive,  and  even  the  poorest  worshipers  can  make  them.  Prayers  to  Sha-
mash  and Marduk specify maṣḫatu flour as what the widow offers to the god.5 
Baruch Schwartz considers that Leviticus 1–3 is a unified divine speech pertain-
ing  to  gift  offerings  (ה ֶשּׁ ִא),  which  are  distinct  from  expiatory  offerings  in  that 
they  allowed  the  worshiper  to  offer  Yahweh  a  token  of  reverence  on  various 
occasions, including: fulfillment of vows, visits to the sanctuary, supplication in 
times  of  distress,  and  gratitude.6  Schwartz  also  suggests  that  Leviticus  2  was 
placed  between  the two major  categories  of  such  offerings  (whole  burnt  offer-
ings in Leviticus 1 and sacrifices of well-being in Leviticus 3) precisely to affirm 
that even the poorest Israelite could make a gift offering.7 The Priestly material 
also allows that for a purification offering, someone too poor to afford either a 
sheep or two turtledoves may offer a portion of choice flour (  ֶלֹסת , Lev 5:11). 

In the story of Noah, although the text does not explicitly use terms for “an-
ger” to describe the deity’s attitude in sending the flood, such a destructive act 
in  the  ancient  Near  Eastern  context  presumes  anger  (Gen  6–7).  The  sacrifice 
offered by Noah after the flood is pleasing to Yahweh and clearly implies a paci-
fication of divine anger (Gen 8:20–22). While animals rather than grain are of-
fered  there, a gradation  of offerings allowing for more affordable commodities 
such as grain may be assumed in the sacrificial system presumed by this story. 
The  evidence  from  Mesopotamia  and  from  the  Priestly  writings  just  discussed 
supports such a presumption.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

 
Line 17 of Nisaba 1 concludes with the speaker’s offer to proclaim the god-
dess’s great achievements, an  offer that fits  the form often  described as  a con-
cluding “promise/vow of praise.” In the ancient Near East praise was conceived 
primarily  as public  narration,  likely  accompanied  by  celebration,  in  which  the 
speaker attested to specific experiences of divine favor by which the deity had 
confirmed his or her responsiveness and power.8 This conception is reflected in 
the Hebrew Bible. Biblical scholars classify roughly a third of the biblical psalms 
as having a literary form known as the individual lament, whose description has 
been  heavily  influenced  by  the  structure  of  incantation-prayers  (see  page  61). 
Like  incantation-prayers,  the  individual  lament  follows  petition  with  a  vow  of 
praise. However, among the biblical psalms, such a structure rarely occurs in a 
simple  linear  way.  In  Psalm  9:14–15,  for  example,  the  speaker’s  petition  for 
mercy is followed by a promise to praise the deity in public:9 “so that I may re-
count all your praises, and, in the gates of daughter Zion, rejoice in your deliv-
erance.” Yet, verse twenty of the same psalm voices another petition: “Rise up, O 
LORD! Do not let mortals prevail.” 
 
8  See, e.g., the poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, especially the opening hymn (page 483) and Tablet IV. 
9  Both the verb used here (רפס piel, “to recount”) and the location of the speaker suggest a pub-
lic performance.

THE PRAYER:  

While not completely consistent, those textual witnesses to the prayer that 
preserve  a  rubric  refer  to  our  prayer  in  Sumerian  as  ka-inim-ma  šu-íl-lá  dutu-
kam, “the wording of a shuilla to Shamash.”1  Several witnesses show interesting 
variations within the text of the prayer.2 For example, two versions of the peti-
tion  suggest  differing  emphases.  In  several  MSS,  the  self-introduction  and  the 
lament  are  missing.  This  leaves  the  prayer  with  little  motivation  beyond  the 
general  desire  for  a  good  life.  The  unnamed  supplicant  seeks  a  life filled  with 
positive portents. But the longer versions of the prayer, namely, MSS D 8ʹ–11ʹ, G 
19–26, and I 17–22, which differ among themselves, contain a self-introduction 
and a lament and are therefore more specific in their concern. Particularly in MS 
G, the supplicant, perhaps a king,3 is concerned with bad omens that cause him 
to  be  continually  anxious.  The  difference  in  emphasis  of  the  prayer  is  accom-
plished simply by adding (or removing4) several lines without otherwise modify-
ing the surrounding text. 

There is evidence that supplicants recited Shamash 1 in a variety of ritual 
contexts.  Claus  Ambos  places  Shamash  1,  particularly  as  exemplified  in  MS  A 
(along with the other rituals and prayers on the same tablet) in the ritual series 
Bīt salāʾ mê (“Water-sprinkling house”).5 MSS α, β and γ quote the incipit, that is, 
the first few words of Shamash 1, in their ritual instructions. MS α is likely also a 
 
1  MSS A, B, F and I. MS K reads šu-íl-lá dutu-ke4. 
2  See Mayer, UFBG, 503 for the textual witnesses. I follow his sigla. 
3  In  MS  G  the  supplicant  is  an  unknown  Aplutu;  MS  D  reads  in  this  place  anāku  annanna  mar 
annanna, “I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so,” the most common place holder in prayers; and MS I 
reads, Šamaš-šum-ukīn, the seventh century king of Babylon. In the present treatment of the text, 
lines 18–25 of the text, notes, and translation represent the major addition in MS G. 
4  One cannot be certain of the textual history of the two major versions. 
5  See Ambos, 45–53 and 280–89.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

Bīt  salāʾ  mê  (“Water-sprinkling  house”)  ritual.6  MS  β  is  a  collection  of  medical 
rituals and incantations.7 It references several incantations, including ours, only 
by way of their incipits. Of these, scholars have only identified our prayer with 
relative certainty.8 While superficially the whole of MS γ is identifiable as a nam-
burbi  collection,  the  MS  actually  includes  a  mixture  of  ritual  types.9    For  this 
reason, it is not clear that MS γ is itself a witness to a namburbi context for our 
prayer.10 In any case, it is clear that some version of our prayer was used in both 
Bīt salāʾ mê and various medical rituals. 

The  prayer  has  three  major  sections:  a  long  invocation,  an  extended  peti-

tion, and a rather short conditional call for praise. 
A detailed structure of the prayer is as follows: 

A) God’s name, honorific titles and attributes (1–6) 
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (7–17) 

I) Invocation 
 
 
II) Petition 
 
 
 
III) Final, conditional call for praise of the god (43–47) 

A) Self-introduction (18–19) (missing in the shorter versions) 
B) Lament (20–25) (missing in the shorter versions) 
C) Plea (25–43) 

A lengthy invocation begins with a set of traditional honorific epithets be-
fore calling on Shamash by name. The last of these involve the bringing of hap-
piness to the people and setting them free. These set the stage for mention of the 
various skills that the god will need to meet the supplicant’s petition. The invo-
cation  continues  with  additional  honorific  titles  and  transitions  to  a  praise  of 
specific and special skills of Shamash. These skills, providing a lone man with a 
friend, giving an heir to the impotent, etc., continue the theme of Shamash being 
a  provider  of  happiness  and  freedom  to  the  people.  The  invocation  ends  with 
praise of Shamash’s actions as judge of the gods and as one who gives judgment 
 
6  Compare Mayer’s suggestion that MSS A and α are mīs pî rituals (UFBG, 503).  
7  The incipit referencing our prayer is at BAM 322:64. See Mayer, UFBG, 503. On the composite 
nature  of this witness see Franz Köcher,  Die  babylonisch-assyrische Medizin in Texten  und Unter-
suchungen (6 vols; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1962–1980), IV.ix–x and 322. F. A. M. Wiggermann, Meso-
potamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts (Groningen: Styx, 1992), 126 notes a possible associa-
tion  between  our  prayer  and  those  mentioned  in  BAM  332  that  use  the  epithet  ur.sag,  Akk. 
qarrādu, “hero,” for example at line 64. Other examples include BAM 3:28ʹ–32ʹ, also a medical 
text, and KAR 253, rev. 8. The exact nature of this relationship if any is unclear.  
8  See Köcher, babylonisch-assyrische Medizin, IV.v. 
9  Of MS γ Maul writes, “The basis for the combination of such diverse rituals as in KAR 72 will 
probably  always  remain  unclear”  (“Der  Grund  für  die  Kombination  von  so  unterschiedlichen 
Ritualen wie in der Tafel KAR n72 wird wohl für immer unklar bleiben”; ZB, 175). And in note 
162 on the same page he says, “The purpose of the first ritual (KAR 72, obv. 1–25) is unclear” 
(“Der Zweck des ersten Ritual [KAR n72 Vs, 1–25] ist unklar”). KAR 72:24 is our MS γ. On the 
multiple ritual contexts of our prayer see also Mayer, UFBG, 19–20. 
10  See also MS K, which attests the whole prayer on a tablet concerned with a namburbi-ritual.

to  humankind  by  way  of  haruspicy,  “on  the  exta  of  a  sheep  you  inscribe  the 
omen; you place judgment.”   

This praise of Shamash as judge provides not only an end of the invocation 
but an introduction to the petition. Aplutu, the supplicant of MS G, first formally 
introduces himself and then laments, “the sting of the flesh (omen) has befallen 
me.”  This  directly  ties  to  the  previous  reference  to  Shamash’s  role  in  giving 
judgment by haruspicy. But as the lament unfolds, we  quickly learn that  there 
are other evil signs, broken chariot parts, red ants in the house, and other un-
named  evil  omens,  that  befall  the  supplicant.  The  lament  ends  with  the  stock 
phrase,  palḫāku  adrāku  u  šutādurāku,  “I  am  afraid,  anxious,  and  constantly  in 
fear.” The shorter versions of this prayer lack both the self-introduction and la-
ment. The plea proper asks Shamash, in his role as judge, to “decree”11 favorable 
portents,  including  good  dreams  and  good  fortune.  To  some  extent,  the  final 
three lines read as a continuation of the plea. But based on the rather set pat-
terns in such prayers, I think there can be little doubt that this section is condi-
tional. Unlike many other such conditional endings, these lines in our prayer are 
the supplicant’s request that Shamash be praised rather than the more common 
conditional vow that the supplicant himself will praise the god.12 

One might analyze the last section of this shuilla-prayer as an apodosis to its 
plea’s protasis and understand it as the closing element of the petition.13 While 
the final section does serve such a function, it also harks back to the invocation 
and creates, with the invocation, an inclusio for the whole prayer. The supplicant 
enumerates many praiseworthy attributes of the god in the invocation. The ful-
fillment  of  the  petition  adds  yet  another  praiseworthy  element  to  Shamash’s 
resumé.  In  this  way,  the  final  conditional  section  ties  the  invocation  and  the 
petition together. For this reason, I think it best to consider the final section on 
the same level as the invocation and petition. 
 
11  See the comment on line 26 below. 
12  See Tzvi Abusch, “The Promise  to Praise the God in Šuilla Prayers,”  in Biblical and  Oriental 
Studies in Memory of William L. Moran (ed. Agustinus Gianto; Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 
2005), 3–48. 
13  Mayer lists the ending of our prayer among a group of conclusions to prayers that he charac-
terizes as follows: “A short praise formula is integrated into the petition, and thus does not have 
the character of a concluding promise or wish of praise” (“Eine kurze Lobformel ist in die Bitten 
integriert, hat also nicht den Charakter eines abschliessenden Lobversprechen oder -wunsches”; 
UFBG, 347; emphasis original). This group makes up one of three under his more general head-
ing of “Petitions involving the promise of praise, or wish of praise” (“Bitten nach dem Lobver-
sprechen bzw. Lobwunsch”; see UFBG, 347–48). Abusch, “Promise,” 6, also notes the existence 
of deviations in the way shuilla-prayers end.

Line  1:  ÉN  =  šiptu,  “incantation,  ritual  wording.”  This  marks  the  beginning  of  the 
wording of the prayer. It is not actually part of the prayer itself. Šurbû, “exalted, supreme,” 
is often used to describe deities and their epithets (see CAD Š/3, 341–42). The Š stem ver-
bal adjective is used here as an elative (i.e., superlative), “most exalted.” Gitmālu, “perfect, 
ideal.” Aplu, “son, heir.” dAŠ.ÍM.BABBAR = Namraṣīt, an epithet for Sin, the lunar deity. The 
prayer begins with several lines of stock epithets to Shamash or minor variants on such 
stock epithets. Despite the fact that the prayer does not use Shamash’s name until line 3, 
there can be no doubt that the prayer is addressed to him.  

šiptu: surbû gitmālu apil Namraṣīt 

Line  2:  ZÁLAG  =  nūru,  “light,”  is  on  occasion  an  appellative  for  Shamash.  Eddēššû, 
“constantly  self-renewing.”  Based  on  the  participle  in  the  following  clause,  the  form  of 
petû, “to open,” is best understood as a ms participle (pētû). The participle is bound to the 
following noun; therefore, we expect pēti. But in SB Akkadian a participle from a III-weak 
root  in  construct  with  a  following  substantive  often  ends  with  –û  (see  Brigitte  R.  M. 
Groneberg,  Syntax,  Morphologie  und  Stil  der  jungbabylonischen  „hymnischen“  Literatur,  2 
Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 14/1–2; Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 
1.95). UN.MEŠ = nišū, “people.” The idiom pān nišī petû, “to open the peoples’ face,” means 
“to bring happiness” (see CAD P, 351). Nūra kullumu, “to show someone the light,” implies 
setting someone free from prison. Note the PN Šamaš-nūra-kullimanni, “O Shamash, set me 
free!” See CAD K, 524–25. Participial description dominates in this line and the next. 

nūru eddēššû pētû pān nišī mukallim nūra 

Line 3:  dUTU = Šamaš.  Muštēšir from  šutēšuru (Št lex. of  ešēru),  “to put in order,  to 
clear up, to provide justice.” The form is a ms participle (bound form). LÚ.ÚŠ = mītu, “dead 
person.”  LÚ.TI  =  balāṭu,  “living  person.”  Barû,  “to  see.”  Participles  from  III-weak  roots 
sometimes lack the final short vowel; it is preserved in MSS E and F. Kalû (bound: kal[a]), 
“all, every.”  The idiom  mimma šumšu, lit.  “whatever  its name,” means “anything, every-
thing” (see CAD M/2, 75–76). Shamash can provide justice for all people, living and dead,

Line 4: AN = šamû, “heaven.” KI = erṣetu, “earth, land.” Mayer’s MSS F and G replace 
šamê u erṣetim with ilī, “of the gods.” KUR = mātu, “land, country.” KUR.KUR = mātāti (pl. of 
mātu). Note the doubling of the sign to indicate a plural noun. Šarūru, “radiance.” 

Šamaš nūr šamê u erṣetim šarūr mātāti 

Line 5: EN = bēlu, “lord.” Ṣulūlu, literally “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor 
of  divine  or  royal  protection  (see  CAD  Ṣ,  243).  É-babbar-ra  =  E-babbar,  the  Sumerian 
name of Shamash’s temple at Sippar. See A. C. V. M. Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebab-
bar  Temple  at  Sippar:  Its  Administration  and  Its  Prosopography  (Leiden:  Nederlands  Histor-
isch-Archaeologisch Instituut, 1997). 

bēl Sippar ṣulūl E-babbar 

Line 6: Talīmu, “favorite or beloved brother.” dAMAR.UTU = Marduk. Tukultu (tuklatu), 

“trust, mainstay, object of trust, help.” KÁ.DINGIR.RAki = Bābilu, “Babylon.”  

talīm Marduk tuklat Bābili 

Line 7: This line is missing from MSS B, C, I, K. Upaqqā is a 3fp durative from puqqu, 
“to pay attention to,” attested only in the D stem. Tenīštu (tenēštu), “humankind.” Rather 
than continuing with the list of epithets, lines 7ff. use finite verbs in complete sentences to 
describe Shamash. Lines 7–9 use verbs in the third person; those in lines 10–15 are second 
person. 

ana nūrīka upaqqā tenīšētum 

Line  8:  Qibītu,  “speech,  command.”  Utaqqû  (Dt  of  [w]aqû),  “to  wait  attentively  on 
someone or something, to attend.” Mayer’s MS F reads the verb as upaqqā instead, mirror-
ing the previous line. DINGIR.MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Generally, the Igigi-gods are the lesser or 
younger gods in the pantheon but, on occasion, the name seems to imply the whole pan-
theon. Mayer’s MS F reads GAL.MEŠ = rabûtu, “the great ones,” in place of DINGIR.MEŠ. Occa-
sionally, rabûtu is an epithet for the Igigî (see CAD R, 35).

Line  9:  UN.MEŠ,  see  line  2.  DAGAL.MEŠ  =  rapšāti,  fp  of  rapšu,  “wide,  far-flung.”  Nišī 
rapšāti,  is  a  common  idiom  for  widespread  peoples  (see  CAD  R,  164).  Ṣalmu,  “black.” 
SAG.DU =  qaqqadu, “head.” The idiom ṣalmāt  qaqqadi, “the black-headed ones,” refers to 
humankind.  They  are  like  sheep  led  by  their  divine  shepherds.  Mayer’s  MS  G  reads  the 
beginning of the line differently: ilu u šarru nišī ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “god and king, the black-
headed people.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Qurdu, “heroism,” in the plural means “heroic deeds.” 

nišī rapšāti ṣalmāt qaqqadi idallalā qurdīka 

Line 10:  GURUŠ = eṭlu, “young man, youth.” AŠ (also read  DILI) = ēdu, “single, indi-
vidual.” See eṭlu ēdu, “single/lone man,” in CAD E, 36, 37, 409, and CAD T, 188. (Mayer, 
505 reads the logogram as KAL  DILI, but this does not change the meaning.) Tappû, “part-
ner, friend, companion.” Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause to acquire, to provide.” Description of 
Shamash with second person verbs begins in this line and continues through line 15. 

eṭla ēda tappâ tušarši 

Line 11: Here lā is used proclitically to negate the following noun. CAD I/J, 226 un-
derstands lā išari as an idiom for “impotent” based on išaru, “normal” or “straight” rather 
than  išaru,  “penis.”  See  also  Seux,  284,  n.11  and  AHw,  392.  Tanamdin  (for  tanaddin)  is 
from nadānu, “to give.” The –dd– often changes to –nd– or –md–, as here. See GAG, §32b,c. 
One might expect apla instead of aplu but the nominative case ending often stands for the 
accusative  in  SB  Akkadian.  See  GAG,  §63e.  Note  that  MS  D  reads  ap-li  here,  apparently 
understanding the word as a plural (aplī).  

ana lā išari tanamdin apla 

Line 12: Edlu, “locked.” Sikkūru, “bolt, bar.” Given the plural adj., this noun should be 

taken as a plural, too. Puttû (D of petû), “to open, to unlock.” 

edlūti sikkūr šamê tupatti 

Line 13: Lā nāṭili is a common expression, based on the adj. nāṭilu, “seeing.” Compare 
ana lā išari in line 11. See CAD N/2, 129. In some contexts, nūra šakānu can be understood 
idiomatically to mean “to provide joy” (see CAD N/2, 349). But here a more literal under-
standing is called for. Again, the nominative case vowel appears in place of the accusative 
(i.e.,  on  the  object  of  the  verb):  nūru  for  nūra.  The  light  of  Shamash  can  penetrate  the 
darkness of a blind person.

Line 14: Ṭuppu, “tablet.” Armu, “enclosed.” A ṭuppu armu is a tablet with its envelope, 
an encased tablet. Lā petû, “un-opened.” Šasû, “to shout out, to read aloud.” This verb is 
often used with tablets or inscriptions; see CAD Š/2, 162–63. Shamash sees everything (see 
line 3), even the contents of a tablet inside its clay envelope. 

ṭuppa arma lā petâ tašassi 

Line 15: Libbu literally means “heart” but can also refer to the exta (i.e., the insides) 
of an animal. UDU.NÍTA = immeru, “sheep.” Šaṭāru, “to write, to inscribe.” UZU.MEŠ = šīru, 
“meat, flesh,” here means an  ominous sign (see CAD Š/3, 121–22). One should take in-
scribing the šīru as marking it with abnormalities so that the exta, primarily the liver but 
also other organs including lungs, indicate some omen. Extispicy was a common practice 
in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. Šakānu, “to put, to place.” Dīnu, “judgment.” The last two 
words are added in MSS C and G; they clarify the judicial meaning of “writing omens.” MS 
G also adds the following line between our lines 15 and 16: [Š]amaš muštēšir māti bēl šīmāti 
gišḫurāte a[ttā-ma], “O Shamash, who sets the land in order, you are the lord of the fates 
(and) plans.” Compare MSS D and F in line 17.  
ina libbi immeri tašaṭṭar šīra tašakkan dīna 

Line 16: Dayyānu, “judge.” Igigî is in synonymous parallelism with ilī. 
dayyān ilī bēl Igigî 

Line 17: Šīmtu, “fate, destiny.” Mayer’s MSS G and I vary slightly here. MS G has: [bēlu? 
m]ušīm šīmāt mātāti attā-[ma?], “O lord, you are the one who determines the fates of the 
lands.” MS I: Šam[aš] bēl  mušīm šīmāti attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the lord who deter-
mines the fates.”  Mayer’s  MSS D and  F offer  more significant variation.  They replace the 
text  we  have  labeled  line  17  with  something  else.  MS  D  has:  [Šamaš]  bēl  šīmāti  gišḫurāte 
attā-ma,  “O  Shamash,  you  are  the  lord  of  the  fates  (and)  plans.”  MS  F:  Šamaš  muštēš[ir] 
mātāti attā / bēl šīmāti gišḫurāte attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the one who sets the lands in 
order, you are the lord of the fates (and) plans.”  

Šamaš bēl šīmat māti attā-ma 

Line 18:  Three witnesses, Mayer’s  MSS  F, G, and I, add four, eight, and six  lines re-
spectively after line 17. These all offer variations on stock self-presentation and lamenta-
tion formulas. Lines 18 to 25 follow MS G (translated by Mayer in UFBG, 510). Similar lines 
are found in MS I but they name Shamash-shum-ukin, king of Babylon c. 650  BCE, as the 
supplicant  (translated  by  von  Soden,  319).  MS  D’s  supplement is generic,  using  common 
placeholders  for  the  supplicant’s  name.  The  variations  in  and  rearrangements  of  textual 
material evidenced here and in the  last several lines are quite  typical for  Mesopotamian

prayers  and  incantations.  Consulting  a  critical  edition  is  absolutely  necessary  to  work 
through this material properly (see UFBG, 506–7). IBILA-u-tú = Aplūtu, literally “sonship,” 
is the proper name of an individual from Ḫuzirina (modern Sultantepe). 

anāku Aplūtu mār ilīšu 

Line 19: This line completes a common self-presentation formula, “I am PN1, son of 
PN2,  whose  god  is  DN1  and  whose  goddess is  DN2.”  d30  = Sîn.  dNIN.GAL  =  Nikkal,  Sin’s 
consort. d15 = ištaru, here alongside ilu, means “goddess.”  

ša ilšu Sîn ištaršu Nikkal 

Line 20: Siḫiltu, “pricking, sting.” GAR = naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed, to be 
set in place, to occur” (see CAD Š/3, 156). A passive form is required by context, either an 
N stem preterite, iššaknam, or a predicative, šaknam; as expected, the form is accompanied 
by the 1cs dat. suffix, –am (see UFBG, 91). Compare the first part of the line with the fol-
lowing:  siḫilti  šīri  ana  bīti  šuāti  iššakkan,  “siḫilti  šīri  will  befall  that  house”  (CAD  S,  235, 
citing CT 38 47:41). This “sting of the flesh” is a negative portent resulting from hepato-
mancy  (i.e.,  liver  divination).  The  enclitic  –ma  connects  the two  halves  of  the  line.  The 
second MA sign, represented as «ma» above, is a scribal dittography. UŠ.UŠ = riteddû (Gtn 
of redû), “to drive constantly, to pursue constantly.” The doubling of the logogram is one 
way scribes indicated an iterative stem like the Gtn. The –ni on the verb indicates a 1cs 
pronominal object  suffix. This line begins the supplicant’s lament,  that  is, why he is ap-
pealing to the deity for help. 

siḫilti šīri šaknam-ma irteneddanni 

Line 21: Here ina, in expressions like ina lumun, is causative or instrumental, meaning 
“because of,” “by means of,” or “on account of.” ḪUL = lumnu, “evil (omen).” The words 
that follow lumun (bound form of lumnu) in the next several lines indicate the sign of the 
evil omen that perplexes the supplicant.  GIŠ.GIGIR =  narkabtu,  “chariot.”  MU is the logo-
gram for a 1cs pronominal suffix. A ḫuṣāb narkabti is a wooden part of the chariot that can 
be broken by a horse (see CAD Ḫ, 258).  Šebēru, “to break.” The verb ends with the sub-
junctive marker, –u, because it occurs in a relative clause (headed by ša). Particular omens 
in this line and the next have caused the supplicant distress. 

ina lumun mimma ḫuṣāb narkabtīya ša iššebru  

Line 22: kulbābu, “ant.” SA5.MEŠ = sāmūti from sāmu, “red.” The MEŠ indicates the plu-
ral form of the adj. É = bītu, “house.” IGI-ru = nanmuru (N of amāru), “to be seen, to oc-
cur.” Like iššebru in the previous line, the form of this verb is 3cs preterite with subjunc-
tive. Several Akkadian omens mention ants and red ants in particular in their protasis. For 
example, “If (a man has dug a well within his house and) red ants (kulbābū sāmūtu) have

Line 23: Á.MEŠ = idātu, “signs.” GISKIM.MEŠ = ittātu, “signs.” On ittātu and idātu, see 
CAD I/J, 307–8 (and note page 359). DÙG.GA.MEŠ = ṭābāti, “good things” (sg. ṭābu). This 
line and the next form a common lament formula (see UFBG, 101–2). This formula serves 
as  a  basis  for  the  textual  reconstruction.  The  lament  moves  now  to  a  very  general  and 
vague lament about untoward omens the supplicant has experienced. Its generality permits 
coverage of everything the supplicant—any supplicant—might be worried about. 

ina lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti 

Line 24: GÁL.MEŠ = bašû, “to be.” IGI = pānu. GIB(or GIL).MEŠ = parāku, “to lay across, 
to block, to obstruct.” When used with ana pāni, the verb means “to oppose, to confront” 
(see CAD P, 156–57).  

ša ina bītīya ibšâ ana pānīya ipparkā 

Line 25: All the verbs in this line are 1cs predicatives. Palāḫu, “to fear, to be afraid.” 
Adāru, “to be afraid (of), to fear.” Šutādurāku is a Št 1cs predicative (from adāru). It means 
“I  am  constantly  in  fear.”  See  CAD  A/1,  109  for  a  discussion  of  šutādurāku  and  related 
words. 

palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku 

Line 26: In most versions of this prayer, the second major section of the prayer, the 
petition, begins here without any preceding self-presentation or lament. The first and sec-
ond sections are bound together by šīmat in line 17 and šīmtī šīm here. Šâmu “to allot pow-
er, to decree.” Alaktu, “way, route.” Dummuqu (D of damāqu), “to improve, to make favor-
able, pleasant.” Note the imperatives, which are common in petitions.  

šīmtī šīm alaktī dummiq 

Line 27: Ešēru, “to go well, to be straight.” With omens, the verb means “to be favor-
able.” The form is a 3fp precative. Idātu, see line 23, here with 1cs suffix. This line and the 
next belong together (see UFBG, 507). The linguistic parallelism is very tight. 

līširā idātūya  

Line 28: Damāqu, “to be good.” MÁŠ.GI6 = šuttu, “dream” (pl. šunātu).

Line  29:  Šunat  is  the  bound  form  of  šuttu;  it  introduces  here  a  dependent  clause. 
Naṭālu, “to see.” SIG5 = damqu (m), damiqti (f), damqāti (fp), “good, favorable,” pl. “good 
news,  good  luck.”  The  word  is  probably  to  be  understood  as a  plural,  damqāti.  But  one 
could read damiqti with about the same meaning. The choice between damqāti and damiqti 
is in large measure a matter of convention. See CAD D, 67. Šukna is an impv. from šakānu 
plus 1cs dative suffix. MS F reads terre, a ms impv. from turru (D of târu), which with ana, 
means “to turn something into something.” 

šunat aṭṭula ana damqāti šukna 

Line 30: Išariš, “normally, correctly.” Alāku, “to walk, to go.” Išariš lullik is an idiom 
for “let me prosper” or “let me have a good life” (see CAD I/J, 223). Lukšud “to reach, to 
achieve, to accomplish.” Tappû, “friend, comrade.” 

išariš lullik tappê lukšud 

Line 31: The relative pronoun ša here means, “with reference to.”  Ša ūmīya, should 
likely be understood as an idiom for “during my life,” not unlike the English idioms “all 
my days” or “in my day.” The particle lū, among other uses, expresses a wish in a verbless 
sentence. It is related to the precative. Notice the connection here with line 29 above and 
line 32 below via SIG5. 

ša ūmīya lū damqāti 

Line 32: Šutlumu, “to grant, to bestow generously.” The form is a ms impv. plus 1cs 
pronominal suffix.  INIM.GAR =  egirrû can mean “reputation,” but it also means “ominous 
utterance.”  The  reader should  be  mindful  of  the ambiguity in  this  lexeme.  Several  texts 
associate egirrû and dreams. For example, “the šunātim and igirrê which I saw and heard” 
(CAD  E,  45,  citing  A  7705:13;  see  further  Sally  A.  L.  Butler,  Mesopotamian  Concepts  of 
Dreams  and  Dream  Ritual  [AOAT  258;  Münster:  Ugarit-Verlag,  1998],  151–57).  Here  the 
context  favors  “portents,”  perhaps  “spoken  portents,”  over  the  far  less  specific  “reputa-
tion.” SIG5 = dumqu, “goodness, good, welfare.” Egirrê dumqi is a common expression for 
good (spoken) omens.  

šutlimam-ma egirrê dumqi 

Line 33: SILA = sūqu, “street.” Ina sūqi is a common idiom for “publicly.” Magir is the 
3ms predicative of magāru, “to consent, to agree.” In the predicative the verb means “to be 
agreeable, to find favor, to be acceptable.” Qabû, “to speak.” The form is an infinitive plus 
1cs pronominal suffix. Conceptually speaking, perhaps one might understand this and the 
following lines against the contrasting context of Ludlul I 73–98.

Line 34:  MSS F and  G  add two lines here  (our  lines 34–35).  LUGAL  =  šarru,  “king.” 
Šūquru (Š of aqāru), “to hold in esteem, to give honor.” Note that gods and kings are cited 
as a class to themselves, a class above the kabtu u rubû of the next line. 

ilu u šarru lišāqirūʾinni 

Line 35: IDIM = kabtu, “politically influential person.” NUN = rubû, “prince or noble 
person.”  Kabtu  u  rubû  can refer  to a  person  or a  god. Texts  often  pair these two words. 
Epēšu, “to do, to make.” Given the plural subject, we expect līpušū rather than the singular 
līpuš.  In  light  of  the  previous  line,  note  the  following:  kabtum  u  rabûm  mamman  ša  lā 
ušaqqaranni  ul  ibašši,  “there is no influential person or official  who  does not hold  me in 
esteem” (see CAD K, 27, citing TLB 4 22:29). 

kabtu u rubû ša qabîya līpuš 

Line 36: Ulṣu, “pleasure, rejoicing.” Rīštu, “rejoicing, celebration.” Ina ulṣi u rīšāti is a 
very common expression referring to all the joys of life without its difficulties. (W)abālu, 
“to bring, to carry,” but with ūmu as its object, “to pass time” (see CAD A/1, 20). 

ina ulṣi u rīšāti lubil ūmu 

Line 37: Kittu, “truth,” commonly deified as here (note the determinative). Kittu and 
Mishar (see next line) are children of Shamash, which is appropriate given the fact that he

Line 39: Atalluku (Gtn of alāku), “to walk, to go constantly.” The Gtn here is used to 
indicate persistence of protection. Mušallimu is a participle from šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to 
keep well, to give well-being, to heal,” functioning as an adjective. Á = idu, “arm, side.”

Line 41: Atmû (Gt of amû [awûm]), “to speak.” The preterite (and therefore the preca-
tive) can be either ītamu (so MSS G and K) or ītami (so MS A); see CAD A/2, 86. Bunene, a 
son and sometimes sukkallu of  Shamash, as here, is frequently associated with  Kittu and 
Mishar. SUKKAL = sukkallu (šukkallu) is a court official. In some places, Elam, for example, 
a sukkallu was a ruler. For other references to Bunene as the sukkallu of Shamash, see CAD 
S, 359. In light of the verb, the “good thing” in this line (damiqti) is probably a good word. 

lītamūka Bunene sukkalka damiqti 

Line 42:  da-a, Aya, the consort of Shamash. Ḫīrtu, “wife.”  Narāmtu, “beloved (wom-

an).” Šilim is a ms impv. from šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, well, at peace.” 

Aya ḫīrtu narāmtaka šilim liqbīka  

Line 43: Ašarēdu (ašaridu), “first in rank, foremost.” Rašû, “to acquire, to get.” Rišâ is 
a ms impv. Rēmu “mercy, compassion.” On the expression rišâ  rēmu and its variants, see 
UFBG, 225. After this line MS F inserts [i]lu libbaka liṭīb k[abatt]aka li[ppašir], “May the god 
satisfy your heart, may your mind (lit. liver) be released” (see UFBG, 509, n.129(1)). Seux 
offers  a  somewhat  different  reading  and  reconstruction  of  this  additional  line  (see  285, 
n.33). Compare this addition with line 46 below, which provides a very close parallel and 
is missing in MS F. Shamash is invoked one final time in superlative terms, as in the open-
ing line, before the final petition for mercy. 

Šamaš ašarēd ilī attā rišâ rēmu 

Line 44: This line and the following two comprise the short conditional call for the 
gods to praise Shamash. This line harks back to line 4, where Shamash is called nūr šamê u 
erṣetim,  “the  light  of  heaven  and  earth.”  Ḫadû,  “to  rejoice  (in/over).”  Râšu,  “to  rejoice 
(in/over).” On the extremely common parallel between ḫadû and râšu, see CAD Ḫ, 26 and 
R, 211.  

šamû liḫdūka erṣetim lirīška 

Line  45:  Kiššatu,  “totality,  world.”  The  expression  ilū  ša  kiššati  likely  refers  to  the 
whole pantheon. See CAD K, 459. Karābu, “to pronounce a blessing.” Such blessings, often 
in the form of praise, frequently come from the gods.

The Hebrew Bible occasionally applies solar imagery to Yahweh that is simi-
lar to that applied to Shamash himself. Ps 84:12, for example, refers to Yahweh 
as “a sun and a shield” (

“light of Israel.” Solar imagery is particularly clear in Isa 60:2–3, 
,

“but upon you Yahweh will shine,” and 
, “and na-
tions will walk by your light and kings by your shining radiance.” The passage 
shows a strong semantic equivalence to the imagery used in lines 2 and 4 of our 
prayer. On the other hand, in Ezek 8:16, idolatrous temple worshipers are said 
to be “bowing low to (towards) the sun in the east” (
).  
Taken together, the cited passages approve solar imagery when applied to Yah-
weh but condemn the worship of the sun.1

Line 16 refers to Shamash as “judge of the gods, lord of the Igigi.” It is in 
this role that the supplicant calls upon him.2 The Hebrew Bible uses the ‘Judge’ 
epithet for Yahweh and often portrays him in the role of judge. Ps 94:2, for ex-
ample, invokes the deity’s judicial role, 
, “rise up, O judge of the 
earth.” Using an imperative rather than a noun, Ps 82:8 demands that Yahweh 
exercise  this  role  actively,  ץ ֶר ָא ָה  ה ָט ְפ ָשׁ  םי ִה ֱא  ה ָמוּק,  “rise  up,  O  God,  judge  the 
earth!”  (Notice  the  use  of

marshal imagery cannot be ruled out.) Gen 18:25 makes a similar reference in

Kuntillet Ajrud inscription 8:1, wbzrḥ [ ] ʾl with Isa 60:2–3. 2 Kgs 23:11 includes a type of solar 
imagery, a chariot, not seen in our prayer but used with reference to Shamash in other contexts. 
However, line 30 mentions Bunene, Shamash’s chariot driver. See also the apparent solar rite in 
Job 31:26–28, where a lunar image is also involved. 
2  Other  prayers  to  Shamash  further  developed  his  role  as  judge  (see  Shamash  73:22–28,  for 
example, page 206).

justice?” In Ps 7, a psalm permeated with judicial imagery,3 Yahweh judges the 
people (םי ִמּ ַ ןי ִד ָי ה ָוֹהְי; v 2). In Isa 2:4 Yahweh will judge among the nations. The 
supplicant of Ps 26:1 asks Yahweh “judge me!” (
; see likewise Ps 7:9). Here 
and elsewhere 
 is sometimes translated “vindicate me” because the suppli-
cant  surely  expects  that  he  or  she  will  be  vindicated  via  Yahweh’s  judgment. 
Although  the  references  could  be  multiplied,  these  clearly  show  that  Yahweh 
exercised a similar divine role in Israel as Shamash did in Mesopotamia. But an 
interesting  contrast  comes  up  in  a  survey  of  biblical  texts related  to  Yahweh’s 
judicial role. On the one hand, Yahweh, unlike Shamash, who is the judge of the 
gods, calls the gods to assemble to judge his people (Ps 50:4–5, where “heavens” 
and  “earth”  seem  to  stand  for  divine  beings).  On  the  other  hand,  in  Ps  82:1, 
while  Yahweh  stands  in  the  divine  assembly  (םי ִה ֱא  ב ֶר ֶק ְבּ)  and  gives  judgment, 
the psalmist (Ps 82:2) thinks this activity is perverse (ל ֶו ָ). Rather than judging 
the cases of the divine beings, the psalmist implores Yahweh to judge the cases 
of the wretched, the orphan, the lowly, and the poor.   

Lines  44–46  in  our  prayer  find  noteworthy  parallels  in  the  Hebrew  Bible. 
For  example,  these  lines  are  thematically  comparable  to  Deut  32:43  LXX, 
προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες υἱοὶ θεοῦ (parallel to ἄγγελοι θεοῦ), “let all the divine 
sons  do  obeisance  to  him”  (NETS),  which  is  reflected  in  the  text  of  4QDeutq 
32:43 (4Q44 Frag. 5ii): םיהלא לכ ול ווחתשה, “worship him all you gods.”4 And Ps 
96:11a illustrates a very similar motif to šamû liḫdūka erṣetim lirīška of line 44. It 
reads: 
, “let the heavens rejoice and the earth exult.” The 
juxtaposition of “heavens” and “earth” as seen in this parallel is a common de-
vice in Biblical Hebrew and in many Akkadian texts.5

While it is possible to make too much of it, we might also note the thematic 
similarities between bringing sight, “light,” to the blind in line 13 and Yahweh’s 
ability to restore sight as mentioned, for example, in Isa 35:5, םי ִר ְו ִ י ֵני ֵ ה ָנ ְח ַק ָפּ ִתּ, 
“the  eyes  of  the  blind  will  be  opened,”  and  Isa  61:1c  (Old  Greek),  καὶ  τυφλοῖς

can restore sight to the figuratively or physically blind.

In his ability to read encased tablets, Shamash can free their contents from 
the darkness of their enclosure. A similar idea is found in Isa 29:11–12, which 
uses 
, “the sealed book/scroll,” as a metaphor for prophecy. Yahweh 
surely knows the contents of the sealed document, for he is the source of proph-
 and Akkadian armu have but limited over-
ecy. Note, however, that Hebrew 
lap  in  their  semantic  ranges. 
  is  from  םתח,  “to  affix  a  seal,”  or,  as  in  Isa 
29:11–12  and  elsewhere,  “to  shut  up,  to  close,”  while  Akkadian  armu  is  from 
arāmu, “to cover, to stretch or place something over something else in order to 
cover it.”

The emotion, if not the language expressing it, reflected in the stock phrase 
palḫāku  adrāku  u  šutādurāku,  “I  am  afraid,  anxious,  and  constantly in  fear,”  in 
the context of an ominous dream, is similar to the report of Pharaoh’s dream in 
,  “his  spirit  was  upset,”  and  the  comparable  report  from 
Gen  41:8, 
Nebuchadnezzar in Dan 2:1 (
). But whatever parallel there might be 
between the Akkadian and biblical passages is weakened by the frequent use of 
the Akkadian phrase in many contexts that do not involve dreams. Using even 
more  semantically  distant  language,  Dan  5:6  also  reflects  the  dread  of  an  evil 
omen,

SIN:

A Shuilla: Sin 1 

ALAN LENZI 

Sin (Akk. Suʾen >  Sîn;  Sum. Nanna) was the Babylonian god of  the moon 
and a high god in the Mesopotamian pantheon. He was the firstborn son of Enlil 
and Ninlil, conceived during their illicit relationship described in the myth bear-
ing their names. Sin’s consort was Nikkal (Sum.  dNin-gal). He was the father of 
Shamash and Ishtar, along with a few lesser known deities. 

Sin’s major cultic center was in Ur (at the temple É-kiš-nu-gál), but he was 
honored with a temple or shrine in a number of other Mesopotamian cities, in-
cluding Babylon, Nippur, Ashur, and Uruk. Evidence for his worship appears in 
some  of  the  earliest  cuneiform  documents  and  suggests  a  pre-historic  origin. 
Sin’s  cult  is  also  known  from  the  Syrian  town of  Harran. Although  already  at-
tested at the site in the early second millennium, Sin’s cult flourished at Harran 
in the first millennium (at the temple É-ḫul-ḫul, “house that gives joy”), benefit-
ting  significantly  from  Nabonidus’  infamous  zeal  for  the  deity.1  (Nabonidus’ 
mother  was  a  high  priestess  of  Sin  at  Harran,  and  he  installed  a  daughter  as 
priestess to Sin in Ur.) 

The moon god was responsible for regulating the month, reflecting the Mes-
opotamian use of a lunar calendar. According to the opening lines of the astro-
logical series Enūma Anu Enlil this fate was determined for Sin by Anu, Enlil, and 
Ea.2 Within the same work we see the great oracular significance the Mesopota-
mians  attributed  to  the  appearance  of  the  moon.  In  fact,  the  first  twenty-two 
tablets of the divinatory series are given over to the moon. (There were seventy 
 
1  Worship of Sin continued at Harran as late as the eleventh century of our era. See Tamara M. 
Green, The City of the Moon God: Religious Traditions of Harran (Religions in the Graeco-Roman 
World  114;  Leiden:  Brill,  1992)  for  the  religious  history  of  the  city,  including  an  interesting 
account of how the polytheistic moon-worshippers of Harran navigated (and survived) the Islam-
ic conquest by claiming to be the Sabians mentioned in the Quran (2.62, 5.69, 22.17).

tablets  total  in  Enūma  Anu  Enlil.3)  Tablets  1–14  treat  the  appearance  of  the 
moon’s first crescent (tāmarāti ša Sîn), and tablets 15–22 deal with the middle of 
the month, the potential time for a lunar eclipse.4 This background informs lines 
18–19 of our prayer. 

Sin was represented in iconography by a number of symbols, the most im-
portant of which is the recumbent crescent moon. This symbol is sometimes un-
derstood as the horns of a bull, the animal associated with Sin (see the incanta-
tory text A Cow of Sin5), or a boat. In keeping with his calendrical duties, Sin’s 
divine number was 30. 

A  few  biblical  names  show  Sin  as  their  theophoric  element:  Sennacherib 
(Heb.  בי ִר ֵח ְנ ַס;  Akk.  Sîn-aḫḫē-erība,  “Sin  has  replaced  the  brothers”),  Sanballat 
(Heb.  ט ַלּ ַב ְנ ַס;  Akk.  Sîn-uballiṭ,  “Sin  has  brought  back  to  life”),  and  Shenazzar 
(Heb. ר ַצּ ַא ְנ ֶשׁ; Akk. Sîn-uṣur, “O Sin, protect!”).6 

THE PRAYER:  

The most recent edition of this prayer lists nine  MSS  that preserve parts of 
the prayer and/or ritual instructions. This MS tradition shows significant textual 
diversity, which must be related to the fact that the prayer was used in the Bīt 
rimki ritual series (actually noted by Butler’s MS A) as well as in a namburbi to 
dispel the evil of a lunar eclipse.7 For the sake of illustration, a few examples of 
this textual variation follow. MSS A1 and B1 include an attalû formula in its ver-
sion of the prayer between our lines 12 and 16 while  MSS C1 and F1, the other 
two MSS attesting this part of the prayer, do not.8 MS F1 does, however, make an 
addition in its place: it contains a self-presentation formula that names Ashurba-
nipal as the supplicant of the prayer. In contrast to this identification, MSS A and 
B name Shamash-shum-ukin in our line 22 of the prayer as the supplicant. MS C1, 
though leaving out the attalû formula, presents a fuller text of the prayer in oth-
er places, with additions after our lines 8, 16 (several lines), and 26.

The present text is deliberately eclectic, including material that we deem useful 
for readers trying to acquire familiarity with shuillas. This pedagogical text cannot 
replace consultation of the critical edition. 

Our shuilla begins with an invocation and a very lengthy hymnic introduc-
tion in lines 1–20 (minus lines 13–15, for which see below). Lines 21–22 create 
a transition between  the opening hymn and the petition  section  of the prayer, 
which occurs in lines 23–34. The prayer ends in line 35 with a very brief prom-
ise of praise.9 

The structure of the long opening hymn deserves closer attention. It consists 
of two parts: lines  1–8 treat Sin’s  light-bearing qualities—eternal divine  attrib-
utes—in relation to  temporal beneficiaries, the people; lines 9–20 focus  on  his 
authority and revelatory powers among the gods. 

The  hymn  introduces  the  deity  with  an  invocation  and  a  couple  of  tradi-
tional epithets that set out Sin’s position among the gods (line 1). The following 
couplet uses participial phrases (in lines 2b and 3a) to show Sin, “the perpetual-
ly renewing one” (line 2a), actively dispelling darkness and bringing forth light 
for the benefit of the people (line 3b). In lines 4–7, predicative verbal construc-
tions and nouns with 2ms pronominal suffixes are used to depict Sin’s radiance, 
again a timeless characteristic of the deity; but this depiction is clearly framed 
by references to  those who benefit from it—the people (line 4a) and the wide 
earth (line 7b). Line 8 marks the end of the first half of the hymn with a report 
of the people’s positive reaction to the deity. 

Line 9 begins the second half of  the hymn by re-invoking Sin as Anu, the 
high god, and asserting his inscrutable knowledge. The following couplet (lines 
10–11) makes lexical connections back to lines 5a (ṣētu) and 6b (kīma DN) and 
uses predicative verbal constructions and nouns  with 2ms pronominal suffixes, 
as did lines 4–7; despite reprising Sin’s radiance, the couplet’s purpose is to es-
tablish Sin’s high position and esteem among the gods. Lines 12, 16–17 advance 
the idea of lines 10–11 while also picking up on the theme announced in line 9. 
Sin  presides  over  the  divine  assembly,  answers  the  queries  of  other  gods,  and 
teaches  them  at  his  feet.  In  short,  he  is  sagacious  and  worthy  of  exaltation 
among their ranks. Lines 18–19 focus this idea further. The query of the gods is 
revelatory (thus secret) and related to Sin’s calendrical function; he alone deter-
mines the length of the month, which had hemerological and astrological impli-
cations. Line 20 concludes the hymn in a manner that conceptually recalls line 8 
(see the notes on the latter line below): people celebrate Sin’s divinity. 

If ēmūq lā šanān in line 21 is a comment on ašarēdu in line 1, then line 21 
summarizes both parts of the hymn by explaining or repeating the second half of 
their introductory lines (1b and 9b). In any case, this line moves the prayer from 
praise  (lines  1–20)  to  petition  (lines  23–34)  via  the  self-presentation  formula 
that follows it in line 22 (in two MSS). 
 
9  My interpretation is based on an eclectic text. Individual MSS vary. See the critical edition and 
the notes below. For example, the self-presentation in line 22 only occurs in two MSS.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

The petition section of the prayer is carefully structured to move the deity 
to respond to the supplicant’s petitions. The section begins in lines 23–24 with a 
description of (prior) ritual actions performed for the deity’s benefit. These lead 
naturally into lines 25–27 in which the supplicant explicitly calls on the deity to 
act on their behalf. Both of these sections prepare the deity to heed the suppli-
cant’s petitions, which come in three groups (lines 28, 30–31, and 33–34). Line 
28 contains the first and most general petition: the supplicant wants a favorable 
oracle (note the imperative verb). Line 29 then establishes the supplicant’s need 
(using a verb that is neither an imperative nor precative) in what we may identi-
fy  as  the  prayer’s  only  complaint:  the  supplicant’s  personal  deities  are  angry 
with them. Using three precative verbs, the next two lines (30–31) present the 
supplicant’s petitions for Sin to heal this strained relationship. Line 32 establish-
es the supplicant’s  course of action (using a verb that is  neither an  imperative 
nor  precative):  the  supplicant  has  commissioned  Anzagar,  the  dream  god,  to 
intervene on their behalf with Sin. The next two lines (33–34), using three prec-
ative verbs, contain the petitions related to what the supplicant hopes the dream 
god can do for them: forgive their sin and restore them to well-being. 

According  to  my  analysis  of  this  eclectic  version  of  the prayer, the  text  is 
well-structured to persuade the deity to respond to the supplicant. One may well 
wonder,  therefore,  why  and  for  what purpose lines  13–15,  the  so-called  attalû 
formula, was inserted into this prayer (attested in two MSS, Butler’s A1 and B1). I 
believe the answer is fairly straight forward. First, the attalû  formula concerns 
the evil of a lunar eclipse, a matter that is directly related to Sin, the moon god. 
Second, lines 12, 16–17, and 18–19 thematically establish Sin’s authority among 
the gods and his revelatory knowledge with regard to celestial matters. The sec-
ond part of the hymn therefore seems to be an appropriate  context to  address 
Sin about the problem of the eclipse. Finally, line 12 mentions “the decision of 
the land,” which, when followed by the attalû formula, takes on that formula’s 
clearly defined concern. Furthermore, line 16 describes the gods inquiring of Sin 
for his judgment on the matter. The insertion of the formula between these two 
lines, therefore, attempts to turn what was a rather general statement about Sin’s 
standing  and  decision  making  among  the  gods  into  the  specific  concern  of  re-
solving the issue of the eclipse. If this interpretation is correct, the insertion of 
the attalû formula here was a clever scribal intervention.

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “ritual wording, incantation.” This word marks the beginning of 
the prayer on the tablet. It is not a part of the prayer itself. d30 is Sin’s symbolic number. 
dNANNA-ru  =  nannāru,  “light  of  the  sky,  moon.”  Šūpû,  “resplendent,  manifest,  brilliant, 
famous.” SAG.KAL = ašarēdu (ašaridu), “leader, foremost.” DINGIR.MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Ašarēd 
ilī is a very common title for various deities in prayers (see CAD A/2, 417). It is not specif-
ic to Sin. 
 
   
Line 2: Given the lunar cycle, eddeššû (also eddēšû), “perpetually self-renewing,” is an 
appropriate epithet for the moon god. The word may be taken as an attributive adjective, 
modifying the deity’s name, or it may be taken substantively. Line 1 commends the latter 
option. Nummuru (D of  namāru), “to make bright, to illuminate.” Uklu, “darkness.” Obvi-
ously, the moon is the brightest light in the night sky. 
 
   
Line 3: Šakānu, “to put, to place, to provide.” Namirtu, “light, brightness.” UN.MEŠ = 
nišū, “people.” Apâtu, “numerous, teeming,” is often used to describe people. It can also be 
used alone in the sense of “humanity.” The positions of the participles in lines 2b and 3a 
form  a  grammatical  chiasm  while  the  following  genitives  (ukli  vs.  namirti)  contrast  with 
one another semantically.  
 
   
Line 4: This line takes up where line 3 left off: with the people, the beneficiaries of 
Sin’s work. SAG.DU = qaqqadu, “head.” Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” is a common 
designation for the people of ancient Mesopotamia. It derives from the application of ideas 
about shepherding to the social structure. The  king is a shepherd and the people sheep. 
The fact that the sheep in Mesopotamia had black heads and the people had dark hair may 
have  suggested  the  specific  designation.  Uššuru  (D  of  ašāru),  “to  release,  to  send  forth.” 
Šarūru, “brilliance, ray.” The text describes Sin’s radiance here and in the next three lines, 
without mentioning his active role in providing light (as in the previous two). Notice the 
use of predicative constructions and nouns with a 2ms pronominal suffix attached.

Line  5:  Namrat  is  a  3fs  predicative  from  namāru,  “to  be(come)  bright,  to  shine.”  
UD.DA = ṣētu, “light, shining appearance.” Although ṣētu is very close to the word ṣītu (log-
ogram È = signs UD-DU), “exit, rising” (see Foster, 760, Seux, 278, and von Soden, 316), 
the latter is generally used of the sun’s rising, not the moon’s (but see the celestial epithet 
in line 21). AN = šamû, “heaven.” Ellu, “pure, clear, bright” (= KÙ in line 26). The restora-
tion follows Ebeling, AGH, 6, adopted by Butler (382). 
 
   
Line 6: Šarḫu, “proud, magnificent, splendid.” The adjective is a predicative (3fs); see 
also lines 5 and 8. Dipāru, “torch.” We expect the suffixed form of the nom./acc. noun to 
be dipārka, but dipāra- with a suffix is attested elsewhere (see CAD D, 156, citing BRM 4 
50:20). GIM = kīma, “like, as.” dBIL.GI = Girra, the fire god (see page 145). Ḫimṭu, “burn-
ing,  scorching.”  The  restoration  follows  Mayer’s  suggestion  (UFBG,  491).  The  lexical 
choices in this line support the Girra simile.  
 
   
Line 7: Malû, “to fill.” The verb is a transitive parsāku construction, which is identical 
in form to a predicative but is transitive, i.e., it takes an object (erṣetu). Namrirrū, “awe-
inspiring luminosity,” is usually plural. One might compare it to the word melammu, “radi-
ance, awe-inspiring sheen” (see CAD M/2, 9–12 and the lexical and bilingual sections of 
the namrirrū entry in the CAD [N/1, 237]). KI = erṣetu, “earth.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu 
(f), “wide.” Erṣetu rapaštu is a common phrase for referring to the whole world. 
 
   
Line 8: The previous four lines have expatiated upon Sin’s radiance. This line reports 
the reaction  of those who have benefited from it (see  line 4a and  7b). Šarḫa  (see  line 6 
above) is an adverbial accusative of manner,  modifying the  line’s verb.  Gutaššuru (Dt  of 
gašāru), “to vie with one another.” This is the only instance of this stem of the verb with 
this meaning (see CAD G, 56). When the first letter of a root is g, the infixed –t– usually 
changes  to  a  –d–.  Amāru,  “to  see.”  Kâta,  “you”  (acc.).  Although  the  text  has  mentioned 
people already (lines 3–4), here people take an active role in the prayer. They jostle about 
as if in a crowd to catch a glimpse of Sin. Perhaps we are to imagine people watching a 
religious procession, straining to see the divine image as it passes by. Butler’s MS C1 adds a 
(broken) line here (see 283, line 8a), which may shed some light on the present line: [ ] 
ana ilūtīka upaqqū kayyāna, “. . . to your divinity they are attentive (puqqu) constantly.”

Line 9: Sin is invoked as dAnum, the sky god, the high god of the Mesopotamian pan-
 
theon. The prayer is (rhetorically) exalting Sin, for purposes of praise, to the highest place 
in the pantheon. The ša here is possessive, “whose,” anticipating the referent of the pro-
nominal  suffix  on  milku.  Lamādu,  “to  learn.”  Milku,  “counsel,  advice.”  Mamman,  “some-
body, nobody,” is an indeclinable indefinite pronoun. The second half of the line changes 
the direction of the hymn; in fact, it introduces its last half. The inscrutability of the gods 
is a common theme (see also page 267). Its function in a hymnic setting like this, besides 
the obvious idea of praise, is to contrast the supplicant’s helplessness with the deity’s pow-
er. The supplicant recognizes and confesses (implicitly) reliance upon the deity’s benevo-
lent knowledge. 
 
   
Line 10: Šūturu, “supreme, very  great,” is a 3fs predicative.  dUTU = Šamaš, the  sun 
god and god of justice. Bukru, “son.” Shamash is Sin’s son. This line somewhat parallels the 
first half of line 5 and the second of line 6. The moon god’s shining appearance (ṣētu) is 
likened to Shamash, the sun! Even if this is doxological hyperbole, the attempt to elevate 
Sin is clear. 
 
   
Line 11: Kamāsu, “to kneel.” Maḫru, is a substantive meaning, “front, presence,” but 
can also function as a prepositional phrase, (ina) maḫar–, “before, in front of.” GAL.MEŠ = 
rabûtu,  “great”  (pl).  The  elevation  of  Sin  continues.  The  great  gods  submit  themselves, 
which  is  the meaning  of  the  kneeling  gesture,  to  his authority.  For  the  purposes  of  this 
prayer, Sin is the most important, authoritative deity. 
 
   
Line 12: EŠ.BAR = purussû, “decision, verdict.” KUR = mātu, “land.” The reduplicated 
logogram indicates plurality. GAR = šakānu, “to put, to place, to establish.” But the context 
requires a passive, thus an N stem: naškunu, “to be set, to be established.”  IGI = maḫru, 
“front,” or pānu, “face.” The former is preferred by Mayer  (UFBG, 175–76). Ina  maḫrīka 
means “in front of you.” The gods are not the only ones that submit to his authority; he 
decides the cases of the land, too. In both lines 11 and 12 the submitters do so in front of, 
that is, in the presence of the deity.

Line 13:  Lines 13–15 above are Butler’s lines 12–13 from her  MSS  A1 and B1.  These 
lines  preserve  the  attalû  formula,  a  kind  of  lament.  The  fact  that  line  16  resumes  the 
themes of lines 11 and 12 (and the tone of praise) suggests the formula was secondarily

inserted  into  these  MSS.  Butler’s  MS  C1  in  fact  proves  that  in  at  least  one  version  of  the 
prayer our line 12 is continued by line 16 (it lacks the formula). Butler’s MS F1, also inter-
vening between our lines 12 and 16, deviates from all of these other MSS by naming Ash-
urbanipal  here in a self-presentation formula while leaving out the attalû  lines (see 384, 
lines 13a–13c; note also our line 22 below, preserved in line 19a of Butler’s MSS A and b, in 
which Ashurbanipal’s brother, Shamash-shum-ukin, is named as the supplicant). All of this 
textual data indicates how shuillas could be tailored to a particular occasion for a specific 
individual. To sort through this properly, one must consult the critical edition. ḪUL = lum-
nu,  “evil.”  AN.GE6  =  antalû,  attalû,  “eclipse.”  The  following  d30  indicates  this  is  a  lunar 
eclipse.  ITI  =  arḫu,  “month.”  NENNI  =  annanna  is  a  place  holder;  here  it  stands  for any 
month name or, following UD, day of the month. UD = ūmu, “day.” GAR = šakānu, general-
ly means “to put, to place, to establish” (see line 12 above), but here it means “to occur.” 
The present case calls for a passive verb, thus we should read the logogram as an N stem, 
iššakna, with the ventive.  
 
   
Line 14: Á.MEŠ = idātu and GISKIM.MEŠ = ittātu. For the relationship of the two logo-
grams to ittu, see CAD I/J, 304–10, especially 309–10; note also Maul’s distinctive under-
standing of the words, discussed on pages 359 and 409 of the present volume. NU DÙG = lā 
ṭābu, “not good, unfavorable.” 
 
   
Line 15: É.GAL = ekallu, “palace.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. GÁL = bašû, “to be, to 
exist.” The fact that both palace and land are mentioned together rather strongly suggests 
the attalû formula was reserved for prayers involving the king, the one who ensures securi-
ty and stability throughout the kingdom. 
 
   
Line 16: Šalû, “to ask, to inquire.” SUM = nadānu, “to give.” The logogram should be 
understood as a 2ms durative here and in line 18 (see Butler’s MS C1 on p. 385). For milku, 
see line 9. Resuming the theme of lines 11 and 12, the text again highlights Sin’s reputa-
tion for counsel and continues its expansive opening section of praise. After this line, But-
ler’s  MS C1 offers a fragmentary, deviating text for several lines  (see 385–86 and Mayer, 
UFBG, 492, n. 14[3]). 
 
   
Line 17: Ašābu (wašābum), “to sit, to dwell.” The verb ušbū is a 3mp preterite, but it 
may be better to emend it to read ašbū (see Seux, 279, n.19), a 3mp predicative. Puḫru, 
“assembly.” The singular noun is an adverbial accusative of place (not the subject of the 
verb, which is plural). Šutāmû (Št of amû [awûm]), “to discuss, to consider.” The object of 
the verb is probably an understood milku from the previous line. If we accept the emenda-

tion at the beginning of the line, this verb should probably be read as a durative. KI.TA = 
šaplu can mean “underside, bottom,” but here, with ina and the 2ms pronominal suffix, it 
means “at your feet.” This line develops the idea of line 16 by means of a concrete image: 
the divine council sits at Sin’s feet as students sit at the feet of their schoolmaster. Again, 
Sin is exalted to the head of the pantheon. On the divine council in Mesopotamia, see Alan 
Lenzi,  Secrecy  and  the  Gods:  Secret  Knowledge  in  Ancient  Mesopotamia  and  Biblical  Israel 
(SAAS 19; Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2008), 27–66. 
 
   
Line 18:  The opening invocation is nearly repeated; the remainder of the  line is an 
adaptation of line 16. É-kur is the Sum. name of Enlil’s temple in Nippur, often associated 
with the location of the divine assembly of Mesopotamian deities. Tāmītu (also tāwītum), 
“(oracular) question and/or response” (see CAD T, 123–24).  For preserved texts of tamitu-
prayers, see page 49. W. G. Lambert discusses  the present passage within the context  of 
celestial  divination  in  his  Babylonian  Oracle  Questions  (Mesopotamian  Civilizations  13; 
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2007), 6. The unspecified “they” in our line must be the great 
gods or divine assembly of lines 16–17. 
 
   
Line 19:  UD.NÁ.ÀM = bibbulu (bubbulu), “new moon, the day of disappearance of the 
moon.” Tāmittu stands here for tāmītu (see line 18). Pirištu, “secret,” stands in apposition to 
tāmītu, thereby expressing the common idea that divine revelation is secret—inaccessible 
to humans. Butler’s MS C1 varies here, describing bibbulu as ūm purussê ša ilī rabûti, “the day 
of the (oracular) decision of the great gods” (see 385, line 17). This variant speaks against 
reading  tāmittu  as  tašīltu,  “celebration,  delight,  splendor,”  as  some  have  done  (see,  e.g., 
Seux, 279; the sign for MIT and ŠIL are very similar). For the revelatory significance of the 
new moon as described here, see Lenzi, Secrecy and the Gods, 165–66, n.145. 
 
   
Line 20:  UD.30.KÁM means “the 30th  day.”  The Akkadian  for this logogram is uncer-
tain. Isinnu, “feast day, festival.” Tašīltu, “joy, delight, festiveness, celebration.” DINGIR-ti = 
ilūtu, “divinity.” Butler’s MS C1 adds two fragmentary lines here (see 386, lines 18a–18b). 
 
   
Line 21:  dAŠ.IM5.BABBAR = Namraṣīt, an epithet for Sin, which means something like 
“Radiant Rising One.” Ēmūqu, “force, strength.” Lā šanān, “unrivaled, without equal.” This 
epithet may be picking up on ašarēdu in line 1. The last half of the line repeats line 9b. It 
seems the line has attempted to summarize the two parts of the foregoing hymn. It func-
tions as a transition from praise to petition, the next section of the prayer.

Line  22:  This  self-presentation  is  only  preserved  in  two  MSS,  Butler’s  A  and  b;  the 
ritual  actions  and  gestures  described  in  the  next  several  lines,  however,  are  attested  in 
these and other MSS. Anāku = “I.” dGIŠ.NU11-MU-GI.NA = Šamaš-šum-ukīn (“Shamash estab-
lished the name”), king of Babylon from 667–648 BCE and the brother of the great Assyrian 
king Ashurbanipal. Shamash-shum-ukin waged a civil war for four years against his broth-
er in Nineveh. ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.”  
 
    
Line  23:  Sarāqu,  “to  sprinkle,  to  pour,  to  strew.”  Širqu  (also  sirqu,  serqu),  literally, 
“sprinkling,” but generally refers to an offering of strewn flour. Note this word is a cognate 
accusative of the  verb. Mūšu,  “night.”  Ellu,  “pure, clean,”  conceptually must refer to the 
offering,  širqu,  rather  than  the  night.  In  lines  23–24  the  supplicant  describes  the  ritual 
actions they perform. These are similar but not identical to the actual instructions attested 
on some of the textual witnesses, which vary among themselves. If the actions in lines 23–
24 were performed, it is likely they were done before the reciting of the prayer (see Mayer, 
UFBG, 208–9). 
 
    
Line  24:  Naqû,  “to  pour  out,  to  libate.”  Šikaru,  “beer.”  SAG  =  rēštû,  “first,  pre-
eminent.”  Šikaru  rēštû  designates first-rate beer,  a very  common item to  libate (see  CAD 
Š/2, 426). Dašpu, “honey.” Compare the use of honey here with that in the ritual instruc-
tions in line 38.  
 
    
Line 25:  GIŠ.GÁN.LAGAB? is  obscure.  Quddušu, “purified, consecrated.” Šumu, “name.” 
Zakāru, “to name, to invoke.” After reminding the deity of the ritual actions already per-
formed,  the  supplicant  makes  their  appeal  in  lines  25–27  for  the  god’s  attention,  what 
Mayer calls the “turning” (Hinwendung) part of the prayer (UFBG, 122–45). The verbs are 
probably best taken as performative utterances, the speaking of which executes the ritual 
action.  One  might  translate  these  “I  hereby  do  X.”  These  lines  lead  up  to  the  petitions 
proper in lines 28ff.

Line 26: Šasû, “to call on, to appeal to.” Bēlu, “lord.” Ina qereb, “in the midst of.” See 
line 5 for the vocabulary in the rest of the line. (Butler’s MS C1 adds a line after this one, 
see 387.) Grammatically speaking, the elements of lines 25–26 are arranged chiastically: 
prepositional phrase, substantive referring to the deity, verb / verb, substantive referring

Line 27: For kamāsu, see line 11. Izuzzu, “to stand.” Šeʾû, “to seek.” Kâšu, “you.” The 
verbs that open the line describe the bodily gestures that are attendant to the supplicant’s 
seeking of the deity. These gestures are commonly associated with prayer. It may be signif-
icant to note that just as the gods kneel before Sin so too does the supplicant. The last verb 
is a preterite and should be understood as a performative (see Mayer, UFBG, 170). 
 
    
Line 28: INIM.GAR = egerrû, “reputation, mood, ominous utterance, kledon” (see CAD 
E, 43–45). Dumqu, “good, good fortune.” Mīšaru, “justice.” The first three words are literal-
ly translated, “an oracle of good fortune and justice,” but the genitives are best translated 
adjectivally. UGU = eli, “on, onto, to.” Šukun is a G imperative of šakānu, for which see line 
13. With line 28 the prayer moves into a petitionary mode, asking first for a propitious and 
just oracular utterance. 
 
    
Line  29:  MU  =  1cs  pronominal suffix.  dIŠ8.DAR.<MU>  =  ištartī,  “my  goddess.”  The 
transcription < > indicates that the scribe mistakenly omitted the MU sign. Ištu, “from.” 
Maʾdu  (mādu), “numerous, many.” Despite the  u case vowel, one should understand this 
word as a genitive, matching the case of ūmī, the noun it modifies. Sabāsu (more common-
ly šabāsu), “to be angry.” In this line and the next, the supplicant seeks reconciliation with 
their angry personal deities, who apparently have been estranged from the supplicant for 
quite some time. For personal deities, see page 431.  
 
    
Kittu and mīšaru are a common word pair (see CAD M/2, 117–18).  
 
    
Line 31:  Urḫu,  “way, path.” Damāqu, “to be(come) favorable, good.” Padānu,  “way, 
path, way of life.” These two nouns are commonly found together (see CAD P, 3). Ešēru, 
“to be well, to go well, to be straight.” Both nouns end with a 1cs pronominal suffix (–ī). In 
a well-balanced line that shows both grammatical and semantic parallelism, the supplicant 
expresses their desire for easier  days, which, following  as it does on line  30, must have 
been  closely  associated  with a  renewed  positive  relationship  with  their  personal  deities. 
 

Line 30: Kittu, “truth.” Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace, to reconcile.” KI =itti, “with.”

The image of a path or way for the course of one’s life is widespread in the ancient Near 
East, figuring prominently in, e.g., biblical literature. 
 
    
Line 32: Lines 32–33 are difficult. Uʾʾuru (D of [w]âru), “to give orders to someone, to 
send, to commission.”  AN.ZA.GÀR = Anzagar is, as the text says, the god of dreams (ili ša 
šunāti), for whom see Butler, 83–85. MÁŠ.GI6.MEŠ = šunātu, “dreams.” Some translators opt 
to make this line the beginning of a conditional sentence, in which Sin is the understood 
subject of the verb (see Butler, 392 and Foster, 761). Others, the present work included, 
take the verb as a 1cs preterite (a performative like the preterites in lines 25–27, see May-
er, UFBG, 199), thereby making the supplicant the subject (see von Soden, 317 and Seux, 
280). Either way, Anzagar is being used here as an intermediary between the supplicant 
and the deity the supplicant addresses, Sin. 
 
    
Line  33:  Ina  šāt  mūši,  “at,  during  night  time.”  Given  the  role  of  the  dream  god,  it 
makes  sense  that  the  action  will  take  place  at  night.  Paṭāru,  “to  loosen,  undo,  release.” 
Arnu, “guilt, fault, sin.” The supplicant  desires  Anzagar to release them from  their guilt, 
perhaps informing the supplicant through a propitious dream. The details of this idea are 
unclear. 
 
    
Line 34:  Šalāmu,  “to  be(come)  healthy,  whole.”  All  four  MS  witnesses  read the  first 
verb as lušme, “let me hear” (i.e., “let me know”), which is difficult to understand in con-
text. The present reading (see Butler, 392) assumes that an early exemplar was corrupted 
by way of copying a ME sign for the text’s LIM. The signs are quite close in  cuneiform. 
Šērtu, “guilt, offense, punishment.” Utallulu (Dt of elēlu), “be purified.” 
 
    
Line 35: The prayer ends with the usual promise of praise. Ana darâti, “forever and 
ever.” Dalīlū, “praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construc-
tion; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomatically, 
“let me proclaim your praises.”  
 
   
Line 36: This line is the rubric, that is, it tells something about the classification of 
the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it 
is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian.

Line 37: DÙ.DÙ.BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” These words alert the user of the tablet that 
the ritual instructions follow. Compare the ÉN at the beginning of the prayer. GIŠ.BANŠUR =  
paššūru, “table.” Bīnu, “tamarisk.” Rakāsu, literally, “to bind, tie up,” but in ritual instruc-
tions the word means “to prepare, to set up, to set out (offerings).” NINDA = akalu, “loaf.” 
Ḫašû, “thyme(?).” ŠE.GIŠ.Ì = šamaššammū, “sesame.” The second person verbs throughout 
the instructions refer to the ritual officiant, an āšipu or exorcist; the third person references 
refer to the supplicant (the exorcist’s client or patient).  
 
   
Line 38: ZÚ.LUM.MA = suluppu, “date,” probably understood collectively here. ZÌ.EŠA = 
saskû (sasqû),  “a fine flour.”  DUB= sarāqu, see  line 23.  NINDA.Ì.DÉ =  mersu, “mersu-cake” 
(made of dates, sesame, and oil). LÀL = dašpu, “honey.” Ì.NUN = ḫimētu, “ghee, butter.” 
 
   
Line 39: KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” BAL = naqû, “to pour out, to libate, to sacrifice.” 3-šú = 
šalāšīšu,  “three  times.”  ŠID  =  manû,  “to  recite,  to  count.”  NÍG.NA  =  nignakku,  “incense 
burner.” (GIŠ.)ŠIM.LI = burāšu, “juniper” (pieces of wood or its resin).  SAG = rēšu, “head, 
top.” GIŠ.NÁ = eršu, “bed.” 
 
   
plicant and Sin. dNANNA-ru, see line 1.

qātā, “hands” (dual). GÌR.II = šēpā, “feet” (dual). LUḪ = mesû, “to wash, to cleanse.”

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
There  are  several  obvious  items  we  could  discuss  in  a  comparative  treat-
ment of this prayer with biblical literature. For example, we could compare and 
contrast the nature of the primary deity in this prayer and the Hebrew Bible: Sin 
is  (or  is  closely  associated  with)  the  moon  whereas  Yahweh  created  the  moon 
(Gen 1:14–18). Despite such a difference, both deities are supremely strong (line 
1, 21 and, e.g., Exod 15:2–19, Ps 66:3, 2 Chron 20:6), uniquely inscrutable (lines 
9,  21  and,  e.g.,  Deut  29:28,  Isa  40:13,  Job),  and  universally  influential, filling 
(malû „ אלמ) the earth with something of their divinity (line 7 and Isa 6:3, Jer 
23:24). We could also note common ritual gestures and postures: kneeling is a 
gesture associated with prayer and standing before someone often implies a po-
sition of servitude in both our Mesopotamian prayer (lines 11, 27) and the He-
brew Bible (e.g., 1 Kgs 8:54, Gen 41:46, 1 Kgs 18:15). Or, among still other pos-
sible comparisons, we could choose to consider the common use of “path” and 
“way”  as  metaphors  for  the  course  of  one’s  life  (line  31  and,  e.g.,  Prov  4:14, 
15:19 [ח ַרֹא (Akk. urḫu) „  ֶר ֶדּ])1 and “calling” as a common means of gaining the 
deity’s attention  in times of need (compare  šasû in line  26 [and  other prayers, 
see  Mayer,  UFBG,  129–31]  with  ארק  in  the  biblical  laments  of  the  individual; 
see,  e.g.,  Pss  3:5,  22:3,  28:1,  31:18,  61:3,  88:10,  130:1).  Instead  of  looking  at 
these in more detail, I will turn our attention to the important idea of the divine 
assembly and the royal image used to depict its leadership.2 

The biblical writers used the following terms to describe the divine assem-
bly in Israel: ל ָה ָק, in the phrase םי ִשֹׁד ְק ל ַה ְק, “the assembly of the holy ones,” in Ps 
89:6; ה ָד ֵ, found in the phrase 
ל ֵא ת ַד , “assembly of god” (Ps 82:1); ד ֵוֹמ, used for 
the divine assembly in Isa 14:13 (ד ֵוֹמ ר ַה ְבּ, “on the mountain of the assembly”); 
 
1  Urḫu and padānu are often used with the verb ešēru (see CAD P, 3 and CAD E, 355). Compare 
the use of the cognate רשׁי in Prov 3:6 (see Tawil, ALCBH, 32).

17 above for the full citation.

and דוֹס, which is the most frequently used term, attested in the phrase ה ָוֹהְי דוֹס, 
“council of Yahweh,” in Jer 23:18 and 22, 
, “council of the holy ones,” 
in Ps 89:8, and   ַ"וֹל ֱא דוֹס, “council of god,” in Job 15:18. These are the semantic 
equivalents of our prayer’s puḫru. As one can see, this terminology offers us ra-
ther  sparse data for understanding the divine assembly in the Bible. We there-
fore need to locate passages that may be thematically or conceptually relevant; 
we need to widen the net. 

 ִשֹׁד ְק דוֹס

םי

Besides  the  broader  contexts  in  which  the  above  terms  occur,  there  are 
many other passages that offer evidence for Yahweh’s divine assembly, including 
at  least  the  following:  Gen  1:26–27,  3:22,  6:1–4,  11:7,  Deut  32:8–9,  33:2–3,  1 
Kgs  22:19–23,  Job  1–2,  Pss  29,  58:1,  Isa  6,  24:21,  40:1–11,  Ezek  1:1–3:15, 
28:14, 16, Zech 3, and Dan 10.  

Reading these passages together, we may piece together an image  of Yah-
weh presiding over his divine assembly as a king (see Ps 29, especially v. 10, Isa 
6:1, and 1 Kgs 22:19). Like his human counterpart, here Yahweh held court with 
his divine retinue (Job 1:6, 2:1), deliberated about the direction of various hu-
man affairs (1 Kgs 22:19–23 „ 1 Chron 18:18–22), sat in judgment on other di-
vine  beings  (Ps  82:1–8),  and  commissioned  human  messengers  to  deliver  his 
words (Isa 6, Jer 23:18–22), among other activities. Like a king, Yahweh is pre-
sented as the ultimate and final authority in the divine assembly—as Sin is pre-
sented in our prayer (lines 11 and 17). Moreover, just as a king’s council would 
often meet in the palace (the king’s house), a god’s assembly would often meet 
in his house, a temple. Sin’s assembly met in Ekur, according to line 18 of our 
prayer; Yahweh’s assembly is explicitly described as meeting in his temple in Isa 
6:1. In other words, Yahweh presided over a divine assembly very much like the 
one  described  in  our  prayer  (and  known  from  many  other  Mesopotamian 
sources), even if he alone was considered a god.

A Universal Namburbi: Ea, Shamash, and Asalluḫi 1 

JEFFREY L. COOLEY 

EA, SHAMASH:  

See pages 227 and 197, respectively. 

ASALLUḪI:  

Like many minor gods, Asalluḫi (also, Asarluḫi) was once a minor god asso-
ciated  with  a minor  location  (Kuara,  a  site  near Eridu),  who  was later syncre-
tized with a high god. In this case, that high god was Marduk.1 The earliest evi-
dence for this syncretism is in the OB period. Though it is not entirely clear why 
the syncretism took place, it is possible that Marduk, who was up to that point 
essentially  unknown  in  the  south,  was  equated  with  Asalluḫi  because  of  both 
deities’  association  with  incantations.  Later,  as  Marduk  continued  to  grow  in 
status, his identification with Asalluḫi became entirely confined to such magical 
contexts.2 Alternatively, we know that Asalluḫi was considered the son of Enki. 
Perhaps  as  Marduk’s  regional  standing  increased  and  he  too  was  afforded  this 
patrilineage, the two gods were simply equated.3 Or maybe it was a deliberate 
invention on the part of the Babylonian priesthood to give the upstart Marduk 
legitimacy via a relationship with Enki by placing him in the Eridu pantheon.4 

Whatever  the origin of the Marduk-Asalluḫi syncretism, the  latter name is 
almost exclusively used as Marduk’s epithet in incantations and prayers. In addi-
tion to this, the syncretism is grounded mythologically twice in Enūma eliš. First, 
Anshar  dubs  the  triumphant  Marduk  “Asalluḫi”  (Tablet  VI  101),  the  result  of 
which all the gods must obey his commands. Though this is not stated explicitly 
in Enūma eliš, the logic seems to be that people invoke Marduk-Asalluḫi because

2  The  connection  of  Asalluḫi  with incantations  is  quite  strong,  even  in  the  Sumerian  material 
(though Abusch points out that even this has been overstated; 543). Early evidence for such a 
link between Marduk and magic, however, is significantly more limited making this hypothesis 
for the syncretism difficult to demonstrate (Sommerfeld, 16–18).

the gods are bound, by oath, to obey his commands in the wake of the conflict 
with Tiamat.5 Later on the same tablet (but within the litany of Marduk’s fifty 
acquired names), Anu also gives Marduk the name “Asalluḫi” (VI 147) as well as 
two  variants  associated  specifically  with  the  Asalluḫi  moniker,  dnam-til-la  and 
dnam-ru. The two names do not seem to reflect any deity actively worshipped or 
widely (or narrowly) recognized in the society of ancient Iraq. Rather, they ap-
pear  to  be  deified  abstractions  that  reflect  upon  specific  facets  of  Marduk-
Asalluḫi’s  godhead.  The  ancient  hermeneutics  of  name  etymology  in  Akkadian 
are  beyond  the  scope  of this introduction.  Nonetheless,  a  few,  brief  comments 
can be made.  

The first of these variants,  dnam-til-la, (VI 151) is grounded in the creation 
myth: bēlum ša šiptīšu elletim uballiṭu ilī mītūti, “(dnam-til-la is) the lord who, by 
his pure incantation, revived the dead gods” (VI 153). This mythic etiology links 
Asalluḫi (i.e., Marduk in incantation, šiptu) with Marduk as the gods’ savior in 
Enūma eliš (nam-til = balāṭu).6  Nonetheless, the link that connects this deified 
idea  and  the god  Asalluḫi  is unclear.  The second  variant,  dnam-ru,  (VI  155)  is 
explained in Enūma eliš as if it were the Akkadian word namru, “shining,” and by 
extension, “pure”: ilu ellu mullilu alaktīni, “the pure god who purifies our ways” 
(VI 156).7 However, nam-ru can also be read nam-šub, a logographic writing of 
šiptu!8 In this case it is entirely clear why the abstract idea should be divinized 
and associated with Asalluḫi. 

In addition to this, both dnam-til-la and dnam-ru appear in the same order in 
the god-lists.9 There, the name  dnam-ru is understood differently: Asarluḫi nam-
ru : Marduk ša mēti, “Asalluḫi is Namru : Marduk of the dead.” The scribe who 
contributed  this  explanation  in  the  god  list  understood  the  name  as  Sumerian 
and, perhaps, interpreted it as nam = Sumerian abstraction morpheme + šub = 
miqittu, “fallen one” (corpse, etc.), creating a (artificial) Sumerian word nam-šub 
= “fallenness,” i.e., death. While this answer to the name’s Akkadian explana-
tion in the god-list is admittedly speculative, it is supported by the fact that the 
name before it is  dnam-til-la, “life.” Such polarized epithets are appropriate de-
scriptors of Marduk as Asalluḫi who is in command of fate, as our prayer tells us 
(lines 2–10) 
 
5  Thus, compare lines 4–10 with Enūma eliš VI 102–104 . 
6  Note also, that Marduk, as part his personal armament in his battle against Tiamat, holds an 
incantation on his lips, ina šaptīšu  tâ ukalla (IV 60). The terms šiptu and tû frequently occur in 
parallel (see CAD T, 441 for references). See also our prayer here, line 9.

THE PRAYER:  

This prayer (or more accurately, variations thereof) is unusually well attest-
ed.  No less than nine copies, all Assyrian, have come to light. When it can be 
determined,  the only major variation between copies occurs in the list  of omi-
nous  signs,  with  one  copy  (Maul’s  MS  C)  prepared  specifically  for  Esarhaddon 
that  includes  around  two  hundred  specific  possible  portents.  Our  edition  here 
follows Maul’s MS A, which is the most intact in regards to the opening and clos-
ing  sections  and  provides  a  workable  copy  for  pedagogical  purposes.  This 
presentation is in no way a critical edition, for which one should consult Maul.  

This type of prayer, a namburbi, was employed during a prophylactic ritual 
to avert the possible results of evil portents (see page 36 in the general introduc-
tion). Thus, the relationship between such prayers and the Mesopotamian mantic 
tradition is significant.  

Regardless of how we might organize the prayer, the scribe himself has in-
dicated his own sections by incising section divider lines on the tablet. Lines 1–
20 serve as the opening invocation, in which the supplicant identifies the gods 
he is addressing and presents the personal situation which has precipitated the 
ritual. The description of the gods is quite verbose in lines 1–17, and this is in-
dicative  of  the  great  “sociological”  gap  between  the  supplicant  and  the  high 
gods.10 The supplicant, using a common self-presentation formula, presents him-
self as a mere peon who has been terrified by various gloomy portents (lines 18–
20).  

Following the invocation is a list of those portents (lines 21–22 and into a 
gap of indeterminate length). These omens vary greatly in number and content 
by manuscript and are derived from divination literature, specifically the unpro-
voked  types,  Šumma  ālu  (terrestrial  omens)  and  Enūma  Anu  Enlil  (celestial 
omens).11 Preserved in the present version are general celestial omen categories: 
lunar and solar eclipses, as well as stellar and planetary phenomena. These cate-
gories are all dealt with in separate sections of Enūma Anu Enlil. No doubt, lost 
in the lacuna are specific omens within these general categories or perhaps ref-
erence  to  terrestrial  omens.  Though  not  the  case  in  many  other  prayers,  it  is 
because  of  these  listed  omens  that  we  can  be  certain  just  who  the  supplicant 
was: the king. Celestial omens always concern the monarchy and the state, never 
private individuals.12   
 
10  For the issue of invocations and social location, see, most recently, Alan Lenzi, “Invoking the 
God: Interpreting Invocations in Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments of the Individual,” 
JBL 129 (2010), 303–15. 
11  This is in opposition to provoked omens, such as extispicy. 
12  Astrology,  per  se,  in  which  celestial  phenomena  are  thought to  influence  the  lives  and  for-
tunes of the individual, does not appear until the Persian period.  

 

406

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

In that gap as well begins the next section (presently consisting of lines 1ʹ–
12ʹ),13 in which the supplicant describes the solution to these omina. The gods 
should act in such a way so as to protect him from the portents and their ill ef-
fects.  The  image  is  one  of  winds  that  blow  by—winds  are  invisible,  but  those 
they pass can still physically feel the effects. The supplicant specifically requests 
that the portents’ evil effects not be allowed to emanate from the ominous sign 
(lines 3ʹ–7ʹ:  lumuššunu ayy-izīqa, “don’t let  their evil  blow”). Thus, there is the 
recognition that the negative portents will inevitably happen, but the supplicant 
wants the gods to keep their ill effects from taking hold on his person. The sum 
outcome of the gods’ intervention is the health and well-being of the supplicant, 
who will thus be able to continue in his praise and adoration of the gods.  

A single line (13ʹ [MS A’S rev. 14ʹ]) supplies the rubric describing this par-
ticular prayer: ka-inim-ma ḫul-meš dù-a-bi nam búr-da-kam, literally, “It is the 
wording for the resolution of fate concerning all bad things.” There are at least 
two references to this prayer (described as nam-búr-bi ḫul dù-a-bi = namburbî 
lemni kalāma, “apotropaic ritual against any evil”) in the letters sent by Assyrian 
and  Babylonian  scholars  to  the  Assyrian  monarch  Esarhaddon  and  Ashurbani-
pal.14 In both of these letters, the scholar recommends that the king perform the 
ritual. In one of them, the unidentified scholar relays to the king that he should 
modify the namburbi (as well as a prescribed shuilla) by inserting the  specific 
omina against which the prayer is supposed to act. This is the likely explanation 
as to why this prayer has a number of variant manuscripts in which the rework-
ings lie entirely in the portents section. The text of this prayer was considered 
adjustable to a particular ominous situation and this makes it unique among the 
extant namburbi-prayers. 

The  manuscript  ends  with  a  colophon  (rev.  15ʹ–18ʹ,  not  included  in  this 
treatment),15 identifying the copyist and, it seems, adding a bit of a curse, a not 
uncommon feature.16 It was discovered in Ashur, alongside related tablets in the 
so-called “House of the Exorcist.” The copy is written in NA script but the lan-
guage is Standard Babylonian. As is often the case in such circumstances, some 
 
13  The text picks up after the break on the reverse of the tablet after one illegible line. The pre-
served lines of this section in MS A are therefore technically referred to as rev. 2ʹ–rev. 13ʹ. Assyr-
iologists use the prime mark in these situations because it is uncertain how many previous lines 
of the prayer are actually missing.  In the present  treatment, the numbering  of these lines  will 
generally follow Maul’s numbering on pages 475–76 (thus, rev. 2ʹ–rev. 12ʹ = lines 1ʹ–11ʹ) with 
one caveat. Maul has omitted MS A’s rev. 13ʹ (= line 12ʹ), which makes the rubric rev. 14ʹ (= 
line 13ʹ). All lines after his line 11ʹ therefore should be increased by one (thus, his line 12ʹ is the 
present line 13ʹ and the rubric becomes line 14ʹ).

Neo-Assyrianisms peak through: for example, dēn for dīn (lines 2, 11) and ūmē 
for ūmī (line 11ʹ).17

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “spell, incantation, ritual wording.”  dUTU= Šamaš.  DINGIR  = ilu, 
“god.”  GAL = rabû, “great.”  The opening sentence of the prayer, which begins here and 
ends in line 4, invokes the appropriate gods who are to act as cosmic judges.  These lines 
establish certain key concepts (dīna dânu, šimta šâmu, uṣurta uṣṣuru and isqēta ussuku) for 
the hymnic section (lines 5–12) of the invocation. 
 
   
Line 2: Dânu (diānu), “to judge.” The form is a G mp participle. Dīnu, “legal decision, 
trial.” The word here is in the bound/construct form and the ē suggests a Neo-Assyrianism. 
KUR = mātu, “land.” Šâmu (šiāmu), “to decree.” The form is a D mp participle; for this root 
the D participle is usually used in place of the G participle. NAM(.TAR) = šīmtu, “fate, des-
tiny.” Maul restores NAM.MEŠ here (467), making MS A accord with MS B’s preserved read-
ing. But  MS A writes  NAM.TAR.MEŠ in the two other instances of the word (see lines 5–6). 
Assuming scribal consistency, I have restored MS A here in agreement with the usage there.

Line 3: Eṣēru, “to design, to plan, to draw.” The use of the mp participle continues in 
this line. GIŠ.ḪUR = uṣurtu, “design, plan.” Esēqu, “to distribute (lots).” In the D stem, the q 
in the root is normally written with a k (see AHw, 249; CDA, 80), though here one could 
conceivably read the last sign of the word as qú (see CAD I/J, 201). Isqu, “lot.”

Line  4:  AN  =  šamû,  “sky,  heaven.”  KI  =  erṣetu,  “earth,  land.”  The  writing  KI-tim  is 
simply an orthographic convention—mimation had been lost in Babylonian and Assyrian 
for a millennium. Alternatively, one could transcribe tim as tì. Attunu, “you” (2mp subject 
pronoun). The –ma on attunu is non-coordinating here, putting the emphasis on the pro-
noun, which brings the opening sentence to completion. One’s translation should highlight 
this. 
 
   
ŠU.II = qātā (nom. dual), “hands.” 

Line 5: Šâmu and uṣṣuru are inifinitives of šâmu and eṣēru, respectively (see lines 2–3).

Line 6:  TI.LA =  balāṭu, “life.”  The precise  nuance of the phrase šīmat  balāṭi (and its 
variants) is not entirely clear, but a simple literal translation will suffice (see CAD B, 48; 
Š/1, 360). Tašimmā is a G 2cp present/durative from šâmu (see line 2).   
 
   
parallelism between lines 6 and 7, which together form a kind of commentary on line 5.

Line 8: EŠ.BAR = purussû, “decision.” Parāsu, “to decide.” The grammatical parallelism 

purussê balāṭi attunū-ma taparrasā  

uṣurāti balāṭi attunū-ma tuṣṣarā  

tûkunu balāṭu ṣīt pīkunu šalāmu 

 
Line 9: TU6 = tû, “spell, incantation.” Ṣītu, “product, issuance.” KA = pû, “mouth.” Ṣīt 
pî, “utterance, command.” Šalāmu, “to be(come) whole, intact, healthy.” The form is a G 
infinitive. 
 
   
Line 10: Epšu, “action; sorcery” (epiš = bound/construct form). Epiš pî, “command.” 
The writing of the –um after TI.LA indicates that the mimation is not lost when the enclitic 
–ma is added, as is typical for SB.

Line 11: The first half of the line repeats the first half of line 2, essentially beginning 
the invocation anew. Kabāsu, “to tread.” The form is a G mp participle. Participles (again) 
dominate the next several lines. DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “wide.” As in line 4, writ-
ings KI-tim and DAGAL-tim are simply an orthographic convention.  
 
   
Line 12: Ēma, “wherever.” Saḫāpu, “to spread, envelop.” Saḫpū is a G mp predicative. 
SUD  =  rūqu,  “remote,  distant.”  Note  the  close  parallelism  between  the  second  halves  of 
lines  11  and  12.  Note  also  the  reiteration  of  the  gods’  heavenly  and  earthly  dominions

Line 13: Nakāru, “to change, to eliminate, to remove. Lumnu, “evil.” Šakānu, “to es-
tablish.” Dumqu, “good.” Lines 13–17, which begin a sentence that ends in line 20, offer a 
transition from the introductory hymn and the self-presentation formula of 18–20. In this 
transition, the supplicant establishes why these are the appropriate  gods to invoke: they 
are capable of reversing oracular fate. 
 
   
Line 14: Pasāsu, “to erase, to obliterate, to negate.” Á = ittu, “(ominous) sign” (plural 
=  idātu).  GISKIM  =  ittu,  “(ominous)  sign”  (plural  =  ittātu).  The  plural  by-forms  of  ittu, 
idātu and ittātu, occur frequently side-by-side in logographic writing Á.MEŠ GISKIM.MEŠ, see 
CAD I/J, 307–8 and the discussion of *idatu and ittu on pp. 309–10. Often understood as 
simply a pleasant sounding word play involving synonymous plural by-forms of the singu-
lar ittu, Maul has argued that these two terms do, in fact, refer to two different things (ZB, 
6–7). GISKIM (= ittu, plural = ittātu) is the animal, plant, star, etc. (or combination of these 
things), by which the sign reveals itself (i.e., “omen indicator,” Maul’s “Omenanzeiger”). Á 
(= ittu, plural = idātu) is the radiating (positive or negative) power of the GISKIM on the 
affected party (Maul’s “‘Abstrahlung’ des Omenanzeiger”). One might not be able to pre-
vent a  certain  ominous  event  (GISKIM)  from  occurring,  but  one  might  be  able  deflect its 
power (Á). ḪUL = lemnu, “evil.”

Line 16: Salātu, “to trim, to sever.” Qû, “thread, line.”  Maul suggests that the qê lumni 
was  conceived  of  as  a  kind  of  incubation  or  development  which  took  place  in  the  time 
between  the  omen’s  indication and  the actual  calamity  (ZB,  5) and,  in a  sense,  tied  the 
omen indicator and result together. It was in the gods’ ability to sever that thread and the 
namburbi-ritual initiated that act. Pašāru, “to loosen, to solve, to dispel, to unravel.” Nam-
burbû, “apotropaic ritual” (see introduction).   
 
   
Line 17: Mala, “as much as.” Bašû, “to be, to exist.” The form is a G fp predicative. 
Mala bašû (and variants) is a common idiom meaning “as much as there is, everything,” 
etc. 
 
   
Line 18: Anāku, 1cs subject pronoun. NENNI = annanna (NENNI-tum = annannītu), “so-
and-so.” A = māru, “son” (mār = bound/construct state). IŠ8.DAR = ištaru, “goddess.” As in 
lines  4  and  11,  mimation  is  written  in  a  frozen  orthography.  Lines  18–20  comprise  the 
main clause of the sentence that began in line 13 and describes precisely: a) who the sup-
plicant is (line 18); b) what has happened (line 19); and c) the supplicant’s resulting emo-

3fp durative + ventive/1cs dative + enclitic –ma.  
 
    
Line 20: Palāḫu, “to fear.” Adāru, “to fear.” Šutāduru (Št pass. of adāru), “to be fright-
ened.” All three of these verbs are 1cs predicatives. Lines 20–22 are similar to a formula 
also found in shuilla-prayers (see Mayer, UFBG, 100–102). 
 
    
Line 21: ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, wickedness” (lumun = bound/construct form). AN.GE6 = 
attalû  (also  attallû,  antalû,  antallû),  “eclipse.”  d30  =  Sîn,  the  moon  god.  In  the  celestial 
divination series, Enūma Anu Enlil, not all lunar and solar eclipses were bad portents (for 
the lunar eclipse portions of the series, see Francesca Rochberg-Halton, Aspects of Babylo-

less, such eclipses were the cause of  significant  concern in  the Assyrian court and every 
known example of the so-called substitute king ritual (itself a namburbî) documented in the 
reports and letters to the Assyrian kings was instigated by a lunar or a solar eclipses (see 
Parpola, LASEA 2, xxii) 
 
    
Line 22: MUL = kakkabu, “star, constellation, planet.” Šūt, “those of . . .” (occurs be-
fore a nominal form in the genitive case).  dA-nim is a frozen orthography—the mimation 
had not been pronounced for a millennium. dIDIM = Enlil/Ellil. Maul restores  dEN.LÍL here 
(469), but I am following  MS B’s preserved text. The “stars of (the paths) of Ea, Anu and 
Enlil” refer to the stars and constellations which fall into three specific regions of the sky, 
envisioned as celestial bands running from east to west, and often referred to as ḫarrān šūt 
Ea, “Path of Ea,” etc. Particular astral features were associated with each of these bands 
(e.g., stars of the Path of Enlil = MUL.APIN I i 1–33; stars of the Path of Anu = MUL.APIN I i 
34–ii  18;  stars  of  the  Path  of  Ea  =  MUL.APIN  I  ii  19–35;  H.  Hunger  and  D.  Pingree, 
MUL.APIN: An Astronomical Compendium in Cuneiform [AfOB 24; Horn: Ferdinand Berger & 
Söhne, 1989]). Erica Reiner and David Pingree understand the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea 
to be variously defined sections of the horizon over which stars are expected to rise helia-
cally: Enlil the northern-most, Anu in the center and closest to the celestial equator, while 
Ea  lies  to  the  south  (Babylonian  Planetary  Omens  Part  2:  Enūma  Anu  Enlil,  Tablets  50–51 
[Bibliotheca  Mesopotamica  2.2;  Malibu:  Undena,  1981],  7).  The  exact  stars  contained 
within each path vary according to  source. Based on the data  provided in  MUL.APIN, the 
Path  of  Enlil  began  at  about  13  degrees  north  of  east,  Ea  extended  south  beginning  at 
about 11 degrees south of east, and Anu would be the area in between these two points 
(Babylonian Planetary  Omens  Part  3 [Cuneiform Monographs  11; Groningen: Styx, 1998], 
15–16). In mentioning all three, the author has effectively included all visible astral phe-
nomena involving the fixed stars exclusively. 
 
  
Line 23: This entire line is only preserved by a few trace wedges in MS A. Enough is 
  
preserved,  however,  that  the  text,  preserved  in  MS  B  can  be  recognized.  MUL.UDU.IDIM= 
bibbu, “wild sheep, a planet.”  The term is the common word in astronomical texts to refer 
to planets whose movement, relative to the fixed stars, seems erratic at first glance (see the 
Greek term πλανήτης, “wanderer”). In some texts MUL.UDU.IDIM refers specifically to Mercu-
ry (and occasionally Saturn or even Mars), but when it is generally used, as in this case, it 
refers to any of the planets. KASKAL = ḫarrānu, “path, road, way.” The term here is being 
used in its  technical sense (see line 22  for  discussion of  the star  paths). Sanāqu,  “to ap-
proach.” The form is G 3cs preterite + subjunctive –u. In contrast to the omina alluded to 
in line 22, those referred to by this line involve both planets and fixed stars. Conjunctions 
of planets and stars were common celestial fodder for omens, and could be either propi-
tious  or  ominous  depending  on  the  planets  and  stars/constellations  involved.  For  a  full 
discussion of planetary phenomena in ancient Mesopotamian celestial divination literature,

terminative-adverbial  –iš,  “to  be  turned into  something”  (see  CAD  M/1,  226,  227).  This 
line finds a very close parallel in newly discovered material in Ludlul IV, line 32 according 
to the new edition (see Amar Annus and Alan Lenzi, Ludlul bēl nēmeqi: The Standard Baby-

The  form  lizīqam-ma  is  a  G  3cs  precative  +  ventive  –am  +  enclitic  –ma.  –šunu  =  3mp 
possessive suffix.  Ayy– is the negative particle prefixed before the preterite to create the 
vetitive, expressing a negative wish. Ayy-izīqa is to be parsed as a vetitive 3cs + ventive –
am. The final m of the ventive has been lost with the loss of mimation in SB.

ter.” The logogram probably stands in place of the G infinitive (see also line 9), which is 
attested elsewhere in phrases similar to the present one (see CAD N/1, 165). 
 
    
Line 9ʹ: Annu, “consent, approval.” Kīnu, “true, authentic, reliable.” The phrase annu

13ʹ.   ka-inim-ma ḫul-meš dù-a-bi nam búr-da-kam* 
 
    
Line 13ʹ: This is the rubric of the prayer which is in Sumerian, as is typical of most 
incantations: “It is the wording for the resolution of fate concerning all bad things.” The 
sign NAM is usually a morpheme of abstraction in Sumerian, as it is in the term namburbî 
(literally, “its release, solution”); but it can also be understood as the logogram for šīmtu 
(written NAM or NAM.TAR, as it is in lines 2, 5–6). Here, the scribe is understanding NAM in 
the latter sense, playing with the name of the ritual namburbî, “its undoing.”  Thus, it be-
comes nam búr-da, “to resolve a (negative) destiny” (Maul, ZB, 12). MS B adds seven lines 
of ritual instruction after the rubric and before the colophon which is to accompany the 
prayer. 

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
There are no prayers in the Hebrew Bible designated for the reversal of the 
negative fate foretold by an omen. As in any other ancient Near Eastern society, 
in ancient Israel there were a plethora of mantic practices, some of which were 
sanctioned  by  the  biblical  authors  (cleromancy,  oneiromancy  and  prophecy), 
and many which were not. In any case, we do not have from Iron Age Israel any 
manuals of divination (if, indeed, there ever were any). Thus, there is no formal 
equivalent of the namburbi-ritual in general or of our prayer here, of which it 
was a part. This being said, there are, in fact, several biblical passages in which 
the  reversal  (ritual  or  otherwise)  of  a  negative  oracular  fate  (delivered  via 
prophecy, itself a form of divination) is a central theme. 
 
2  Kings  3:4–27  recounts  how  Mesha  of  Moab,  following  the  death  of  the 
powerful Ahab, rebels against his Israelite oppressors. In response, the new Isra-
elite king, Jehoram, assembles a coalition which includes both Judah and Edom. 
The  army  encounters  severe  logistical  problems  due  to  the  barrenness  of  the 
countryside during their march around the southern end of the Dead Sea, and, as 
a  result,  the  kings  question whether  or  not Yahweh  is  really  in  support  of  the 
undertaking.  They  decide  to consult  a prophet  (identified as  Elisha),  who  pro-
vides them with a reluctant but unequivocally positive oracle that includes the 
promise  of  ample  supplies  and  utter  victory  over  Moab  (2  Kgs  3:16–19).  The 
kings’ expedition follows according to the oracle until the coalition is besieging 
the  last  urban  center,  Kir-hareseth.  At  this  point,  following  a  failed  breakout 
attempt, Mesha, in an act of desperation, sacrifices his first born son on the city’s 
walls. “A great wrath came against Israel” (
) and the coali-
tion army withdraws, leaving Mesha’s Moab bloody, but independent and, there-
fore,  victorious.  While  scholars  have variously  attempted to  slither  around  the 
edges  of  the  theological  difficulties  in  this  pericope,1  the  most  honest  and 
 
1  A few examples will suffice: the text reflects multiple sources and is therefore sloppily incon-
sistent (Burke Long, “2 Kings III and Genres of Prophetic Narrative,” VT 23 [1973], 337–48); the 
prophecy was reversed because Israel broke the laws of conflict as set out in Deut 20:1–20 (even

straightforward reading remains that Yahweh’s oracle delivered through Elisha 
was effectively reversed by the ritual of Mesha’s sacrifice of his first-born.2 The 
king of Moab appealed to his god which was undoubtedly Kemosh, though the 
biblical text does not acknowledge this overtly. The Israelites were fighting, we 
must remember, not in the land of Yahweh’s inheritance, but in Kemosh’s home 
turf.  Mesha  performed  the  most  poignant  and  powerful  cultic  act  available  to 
him, and the god of Moab responded to the king’s faith by intervening with the 
oracular fate set out by the god of Israel.3 This is in many  ways similar to the 
logic of the namburbi, but a fundamental difference is that Mesha is not invok-
ing the god of the original oracle, Yahweh, in his ritual. 
 
A further biblical passage which displays the logic of the namburbi, perhaps 
most strongly, is Isaiah 38:1–8 and its parallel in 2 Kings 20:1–9. When Hezeki-
ah becomes quite ill, the prophet Isaiah comes to the king (whether he has been 
consulted or has come on his own accord is not stated) and offers the monarch 
an  oracle  from  Yahweh.  It  is not propitious:
הֹכּ 
 
ה ֶי ְח ַת, “Thus Yahweh has said, ‘Command your household, for you are about to 
die and you will not recover.’” Hezekiah responds to the oracle immediately and 
ritually: 
,  “Hezekiah  turned  his  face  to  the 
wall and prayed to Yahweh,” reminding Yahweh how he has served him faithful-
ly.4 Both the supplicant of the namburbi, who admits his personal fear in formu-
laic  terms  (line  20:  palḫākū-ma  adrāku  u  šutādurāku,  “I  am  scared,  frightened, 
terrified”), and Hezekiah, who weeps while praying, attempt to show deep sin-
cerity—and this sincerity adds to the legitimacy (and thus potency) of the ritual. 
Yahweh’s response is almost as quick. Having heard the prayer and observed the 
weeping, the  god of Israel reverses the  oracle, which  Isaiah promptly delivers: 
the king will live for another fifteen years and the city will be rescued from As-
syria. In the account in 2 Kings 20, the prophet then applies a dressing made of 
fig cakes (
) to Hezekiah’s skin condition, which is apparently what was 
ailing  him  (2  Kgs  20:7).5  While  appearing  to  the  modern  reader  as  a  form  of 
homeopathic medicine, we must remember that such healing procedures, espe-
cially if applied by a religious  professional, were rarely devoid of religious di-
mensions.  As  in  the  case  of  Mesopotamian  disease  theory,  the  patient’s  illness 
 
though  breaking  these  laws  was  part  of  the  oracle!  Joe  Sprinkle,  “Deuteronomic  ‘Just  War’ 
[Deut. 20, 10–20] and 2 Kings 3, 27,” ZABR 6 [2000], 285–301); the prophecy was technically 
fulfilled  because  the  army  did,  in  fact,  attack  all  of  the  cities  of  Moab  (Raymond  Westbrook, 
“Elisha’s True Prophecy in 2 Kings 3,” JBL 124 [2005], 530–32).

knowledge,” ZAW 117 (2005), 345–46. 
4  The significance of the specific posturing, towards the wall, is unclear. It could be that it has 
some ritual importance.  
5  This act is placed after the sign of the reverse shadow in the Isaiah account (Isa 38:21).

was by no means a “natural” thing, but was, rather, the result of an angry god.6 
Thus,  here  changing  the  results  of  the  original  oracle  requires  multiple  ritual 
acts, i.e., the prayer and the application of the fig cake to the affected area. In 
this sense, Isaiah is not only functioning as a proper diviner, but also as an āšipu! 
To  confirm  the  results  of  the  new,  positive  oracle,  Yahweh  offers  an  alternate 
sign: the shadow on a kind of  sundial will go backwards instead  of forwards.7 
This  is  a  new  sign  for  a  new  oracle  and  Hezekiah’s  repentance  has  literally 
turned back the clock on the previous prophecy. Again, this is the same logic as 
the namburbi: the appropriate ritual can reverse oracular fate.

In  1  Kings  22  we  have  another  instance  in  which  the  party  affected  by  a 
negative  oracle takes  action  to prevent  the  oracular fate  from  taking  effect. In 
this passage, the kings of Israel and Judah decide to retake Ramoth-Gilead from 
Aram. After agreeing to participate in the campaign, the king of Judah, Jehosh-
aphat, requests that the  leaders invoke an oracle from Yahweh  in order to de-
termine whether or not the undertaking has divine sanction:
ר ֶמאֹ יּ ַו
, “Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, ‘Please in-
 ה ָוֹהְי
quire  now  the  word  of  Yahweh’”  (1  Kgs  22:5).  The  king  of  Israel  assembles  a 
large group of prophets who uniformly deliver the deity’s blessing on the cam-
paign.  Dissatisfied  with  this,  Jehoshaphat  asks  the  king  of  Israel  for  a  second 
oracle to confirm the first, and the king reluctantly sends for Micaiah ben Im-
lah.8 Micaiah’s first oracle delivered in the kings’ presence is in agreement with 
that of the group (1 Kgs 22:15). Incredulous, the king of Israel demands that the 
prophet tell him Yahweh’s true will and the chilling vision that follows contra-
dicts the oracle delivered by the pandering group of prophets. The kings develop 
a  plan  which,  to  a  certain  degree,  recognizes  the  legitimacy  of  both  oracular 
fates—they  launch  their  campaign,  but  the  king  of  Israel  (now  identified  as 
Ahab; 1 Kgs 22:20) disguises himself, eschewing his royal garment for, we pre-
sume, those of a common soldier. The battle, as Micaiah predicted, is a disaster 
for the coalition. Ahab’s disguise does not protect him and he dies as a result of 
an arrow wound to the chest. The king’s solution to the negative oracular fate 
offered by Micaiah is not a ritual one. Even so, the parallel to a well-documented 
namburbi,  the  substitute  king  ritual,  in  which  a  prisoner  dons  the  garb  of  the 
king in order to  absorb the ill  effects of  a  negative omen,9 is far too strong to

Sources,  Translations,  and  Modern  Medical  Analyses  (Urbana  and  Chicago:  University  of  Illinois, 
2004), 11. 
7  The sign (תוֹא) here is not an omen, per se, in that it is not an indicator of the god’s will that 
needs to be interpreted, but is rather a confirmatory sign  from the god. Nonetheless, the rela-
tionship between an omen and this kind of confirmatory sign is significant: they both indicate 
divine will.

ignore.10 In both cases, the king attempts to avoid his oracular fate by disguising 
himself.11 Though the solutions are different in nature (the namburbi is a ritual, 
that of Israel’s king is not), there is an element of logic shared by the two, even 
if it is not as tight as that of Isa 38:1–8/2 Kgs 20:1–9. Oracular fate is not final 
and can possibly be averted. 

While these biblical parallels by no means comprise a single formal ritual, 
such  as  a  namburbi,  they  nonetheless  demonstrate  that  the  god’s  will,  as  ex-
pressed through an oracle, could be changed with the suitable ritual demonstra-
tion. These demonstrations were appropriate to the nature of the oracle and the 
person(s) to whom it was directed.

A Namburbi against the Evil of a Snake:  

Shamash 25 

DUANE SMITH 

SHAMASH:  

See page 197. 

THE PRAYER:  

This prayer is typical in structure and content of the incantation section of 
namburbi-rituals.1 The intent of such rituals is to mitigate or nullify the evil por-
tents of omens (see page 36 for more about namburbis). In the present case, the 
namburbi seeks to nullify the portent of an unsolicited omen, omina oblativa, in 
the form of a snake seen hunting in the supplicant’s house.2 The formal structure 
of Shamash 25 is as follows: 

I) Invocation (1–9a) 
 
 
 
 
II) Petition (9b–21) 

A) The god’s name and honorific titles (1–3) 
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (4–9a) 
 
 

1) In terms of unalterable commands (4–6) 
2) In terms of reviving the dead and releasing the captive (7–9a) 

 
1  See Mayer, UFBG, 34–35.  
2  Šumma ālu Tablets 22–26 (see Sally Freedman, If a City Is Set on a Height: The Akkadian Omen 
Series Shumma Alu ina mele Shakin Vol. 2: Tablets 22–40 [Occasional Publications of the Samuel 
Noah  Kramer  Fund  19;  Philadelphia:  University  of  Pennsylvania  Museum  Babylonian  Section, 
2006], 6–130) contain a large number of snake related omens. Of the hundreds of snake-related 
omens  in  Šumma  ālu  none  exactly  matches  the  two  elements  (a  snake  seen  entering  a  man’s 
house and  hunting there) that one would  expect in the protasis if our  prayer was  intended  to 
mitigate  one  of  these  portents.  The  protasis  of  Šumma  ālu  23:106  (ibid.,  46–47)  addresses  a 
snake entering a man’s house, “if a snake enters a man’s house, that house will be abandoned.” 
Several  omen  protases  address  snakes  hunting  specific  prey  in  a  man’s  house.  For  example, 
Šumma ālu 25–26 ii 6ʹ-7ʹ (ibid., 106–7) and Šumma ālu 25–26:16ʹ, 22ʹ (ibid., 118–19). Regarding 
snake omens and namburbi-rituals, see Erica Reiner, Astral Magic in Babylonia (TAPS 85/4; Phil-
adelphia: The American Philosophical Society, 1995), 83, n.338.

422

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

 

A) Self-presentation (9b–13) 
B) Acknowledgement of reverential stance vis-a-vis the god (14–15) 
C) Lament (16–20a) 
D) Plea (20b–21) 

 
 
III) Conditional promise of praise for the god (22–26)3 

The prayer begins with an invocation that not only calls upon Shamash in 
terms of several of his honorific titles but also in terms of the effectiveness of his 
commands.  The  invocation  ends  with  reference  to  Shamash’s  ability  to  revive 
the dead and release the captive. The reference to these powers provides a tran-
sition to the petition, where the supplicant first introduces themselves and then, 
using the language of submission, “seize your hem,” indicates their reverential 
posture. Here follows a lament in which the supplicant expresses their fears re-
garding the evil portent of a snake seen hunting in their house and pleas to be 
saved. Just as Shamash can release the captive, the supplicant desires that Sha-
mash release  them  from the evil portent.  Finally,  the  supplicant provides  Sha-
mash with motivation. If Shamash saves them, they will be able to praise Sha-
mash and in so doing will inspire others to do the same.  

Unfortunately, the one tablet that bears the text of this prayer (VAT 5) lacks 
ritual  instructions;  it  only  preserves  the  prayer.  Since  there  are  a  number  of 
namburbi-rituals  against  the  evil  of  snakes,4  it  is  impossible  to  reconstruct the 
precise  ritual  instructions  that  might  have  once  been  associated  with  our  par-
ticular prayer. But another namburbi-ritual that seeks to nullify the evil portent 
of a snake hunting in a house incorporates a prayer very similar to ours and may 
shed light on the kinds of ritual actions that could have been prescribed to ac-
company our prayer.5  The ritual begins with the words “namburbî lumun ṣēri ana 
amīli lā iṭeḫḫe lumuššu amīla lā išakkan, “a namburbi (that) the evil of a snake may 
 
3  See Mayer,  UFBG, 35, for a summary of the more  common, two-part analysis  of this prayer. 
Mayer uses Shamash 25 as a paradigm example of the structure of a namburbi-prayer. Differing 
slightly from Mayer, I take the conditional offer of praise as a separate unit. See Shamash 1, page 
369,  for  discussion.  Separating  the  “acknowledgement  of  reverential  stance”  from  the  “self-
introduction,”  I  also  see  the  structure  of the  petition  section  of the  prayer  as  somewhat  more 
complex than does Mayer. 
4  See the eight examples in Maul, 270–303. See also now BM 43090+ and BM 42559+, pub-
lished by Irvine L. Finkel, “On Late Babylonian Medical Training,” in Wisdom, Gods and Litera-
ture:  Studies  in  Assyriology  in  Honour  of  W.  G.  Lambert  (ed.  A.  R.  George  and  Irving  Finkel; 
Winona  Lake:  Eisenbrauns,  2000),  137–224,  here  206–7,  texts  49A  and  49B.  Finkel  has  also 
published  several  Old  Babylonian  incantations  related  to  snakes  (“On  some  Dog,  Snake  and 
Scorpion Incantations,” in Mesopotamian Magic: Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspectives 
[ed. Tzvi Abusch and K. van der Toorn; Groningen: Styx, 1999], 211–52, here 223–34). These 
incantations, however, are not namburbi-prayers in structure; they appear to address the direct 
danger of snakes rather than their ominous portents. As such, they provide a significant contrast 
with prayers such as Shamash 25.  
5  See Maul, 278–82, 80-7-19,88, obv. 7–rev. 15 and minor variants. While this text provides a 
close  parallel to our prayer, it is sufficiently  different to preclude it from being an  alternative 
witness to Shamash 25.

not approach a man, (that) its evil may not affect a man.” According to its ritual 
instructions, at sunset the practitioner draws water, mixes in various plant prod-
ucts (barleys, emmer, lentils) and metals (silver and gold), and sets them “under 
the stars.” In a secluded place, they prepare a reed altar for Shamash. They place 
various  items  including  bread,  honey,  and  ghee  on  and  around  the  altar.  The 
practitioner dips various stones (carnelian, lapis lazuli, plus several others) and 
metals (copper, tin, silver, and gold) in oil and then makes a necklace from them 
for the supplicant. At this point, the exact actions of the practitioner are unclear 
but eventually they make the supplicant recite an incantation that is very much 
like Shamash 25.

296, n.8. Anunnakkū is a collective name from Sumerian that likely originally specified all 
the gods of the pantheon but later, and particularly in Akkadian contexts, may only refer 
to gods of earth and the underworld (see Black and Green, 34). GIDIM = eṭemmu, “spirit of 
the dead, ghosts.” The eṭemmū were normally inhabitants of the underworld (see Black and 
Green,  88–89  and  page 133 in  this  book).  Bēl  anunnakkī  bēl  eṭemmī  is a  common divine

line 4 and lā innû in line 5. An annu is often a positive divine answer to a query. Note, for 
example,  ša  ilum  annam  lā  ippalūšu,  “to  which  the  god  will  not  give  a  positive  answer” 
(cited in CAD A/2, 135). DINGIR = ilu, “god.” Mammam, “somebody.” The presence of ilu 
puts us in the divine realm. With a negative, mammam means “nobody.” Thus, “no god.”

Line 5:  NU = lā. BAL-ú = enû, “to change, to revise.” Innû is a G durative with sub-
junctive –u. Qibītu, “word, command.” Qibīssu has a 3ms pronominal suffix attached; the 
adjacent  –tš–  becomes  –ss–.  The  word  should  be  taken  as the  subject  of  the  verb in the 
following line. 

lā innû qibīssu  

Line 6: The somewhat damaged text appears to read uš-NU-pe-e-li (see CAD Š/3, 323), 
but Maul’s emendation, used here, is certainly correct (296). Šutepêlu (Št pass. of šupêlu), 
“to  be  changed”  (the  root  is a Š-group  middle  weak  quadriliteral;  see  GAG,  §109j).  The 
verb  is a  3cs  durative.  Since  this  line  continues the  relative  clause  started  in  line  4,  we 
expect a verb in the subjunctive here, uštepellu. See CAD Š/3, 323 for examples of both the 
subjunctive and the form used here. 

lā uštepêli  

Line 7: LÚ.ÚŠ = mītu, “a dead person.” In some contexts mītu appears to mean “grave-
ly ill.” Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to revive, to bring back to life,” is an inf., perhaps best ren-
dered here as a gerund (see also the inf. in line 8). For  mīta bulluṭu, see CAD M/2, 141. 
With regard to Shamash, note the personal name Šamaš-mītam-uballiṭ, “Shamash-Revives-
the-Dead.” This line and  the next two bring the invocation to an end  with references  to 
those aspects of Shamash’s nature that are most important to the petition that follows. Not 
only does this line and the next give emphasis to the invocation, they also provide a transi-
tion  to the  petition.  The  reprise of  a direct  call to  Shamash  by  name  lends  emphasis  to 
lines 7 and 8. 

Šamaš mīta bulluṭu 

Line 8: Kasû, “bound, a captive.” Paṭāru, “to loosen, to release,” is another inf. Notice 

the grammatical parallelism with mīta bulluṭu in line 7.

Line 9: ŠU = qātu, “hand.” ŠU.II, ŠU + two vertical wedges (the MIN sign), indicates 
the  dual;  qātī  is  the  oblique  dual  form.  Here  “your  hands”  should  be  understood  as  “in 
your power.” CAD Q, 189 restores <ina> before šu.II-ka-ma. While rare, the omission of 
the preposition is not unknown. No meaning is lost. See CAD Q, 192 for examples of qātu, 
meaning  “in  your/his  power,”  without  the  preposition  in  constructions  with  verbs.  The 
invocation of the deity’s name again here provides a transition into the petition section of 
the prayer. 

qātīkā-ma Šamaš 

Line 10:  ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.” Aradka is the bound form with a 2ms pro-
nominal suffix. This line begins the second major section of the prayer. Lines 10–14 form 
one sentence with the self-presentation formula (lines 10–13) as its subject.

Line 11: NENNI DUMU NENNI = annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so,” is

Line 13: Zarpanitum is the consort of Marduk. In private communications Alan Lenzi 
speculated  that  “Marduk”  and  “Zarpanitum”  are  not  placeholders  but  possibly  indicate 
that this ritual may have been copied for a particular family or, more likely, the [office of 
the] king of Babylon; thus the copyist could assume “Marduk” and “Zarpanitum” were his 
personal gods.  
Zarpānītum 

Line 14: Maḫru, “before, in the presence of.” Maḫarka is a bound form of the word 
plus a 2ms pronominal suffix. GUB-iz! = azziz from i/uzuzzu, “to stand, to appear,” specifi-
cally  before a person or god.  The reading is difficult. Maul, 297, reads  G[U]B-ka. Mayer, 
UFBG,  139,  citing  the  common  expression  maḫarka  azziz,  suggests  the  reading  adopted 
here. It is possible that the scribe confounded ana maḫarka azziz and simply added ka (See 
Maul, 297, n.12; Mayer, UFBG, 139; and Seux, 364, n.4).

Line 15: TÚG.SÍG = sissiktu, “hem, fringe.” Sissiktu here is the hem of a garment. Aṣbat 
from ṣabātu, “to seize, to take hold of.” On sissikta with ṣabātu as a gesture of supplication 
to a god, see CAD Ṣ, 18. Ṣabātu is also used in legal contexts and as an indication of sub-
mission to a king or someone else in authority. Sissiktaka aṣbat can also mean “to swear an 
oath.” See  further,  André  Finet,  “Les  symboles  du  cheveu,  du  bord  du  vêtements  et  de

sissiktaka aṣbat 

Line 16: With this line and the next, we come to the central petition of the prayer: a 
bad omen in the form of a snake pursuing prey in the house. This subsection begins with a 
lament  that  continues  through  the  first  part  of line 20.  Here  ina,  in expressions  like  ina 
lumun X, has a causative or instrumental meaning, “because, by means of, on account of.” 
Contrast this with the meaning of the second ina in our line. ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, misery.” 
MUŠ = ṣerru (ṣēru), “serpent, snake.” É = bītu, “house.” The relative pronoun ša begins a 
clause that describes which snake the supplicant is talking about. The clause ends with the 
subjunctive verb amuru in line 18.  

ina lumun ṣerri ša ina bitīya 

Line 17: Maul reads [ ]-IGI-ru-ma at the beginning of the line (297). The text above 
follows CAD E, 205 ([e]-ši(IGI)-ru-ma). Ešēru, “to make straight, to proceed.” This infinitive 
and the one in line 18 describe what the supplicant saw the snake do. The –ma functions 
as a marker  of continuity  of activity, “and then.” Buʾ(ʾ)uru (bûru) “hunting; game, prey” 
(see CAD B, 366 and CDA, 51). 

ešērū-ma bûru 

Line 18: DÙ-šú = epēšu, “to do, to make,” but with buʾ(ʾ)uru, “to hunt.” On this idiom, 

see CAD E, 205 and B, 366. Amāru, “to see.” 

epēšu amurū-ma 

Line 19: All the verbs in this line and the next are 1cs predicatives. Palāḫu, “to fear, 
to be afraid.” Adāru, “to be afraid (of), to fear.” We expect adrāku rather than adrāka (see

Mayer, UFBG, 73). Palḫāku adrāku (u) sutādurāku is a stock expression in prayers.  

palḫāku adrāka 

Line 20: Šutādurāku is a Št 1cs predicative (from adāru). It means “I am constantly in 
fear.” See CAD A/1, 109 for a discussion  of šutādurāku and  related words.  BI =  šuāti, a 
gen. 3ms independent demonstrative pronoun. 

u šutādurāku ina lumni šuāti 

Line 21: Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to make pass by, to avert.” The form is a ms impv. plus 
1cs acc. pronominal suffix. See CAD E, 394 for this stock phrase. This plea, the only one in 
the prayer, ends the petition section of the prayer. 

šūtiqannī-ma 

Line 22: Narbû, “greatness.” Šāpû (Š of [w]apû), “to proclaim, to announce.” Lušāpi is 
a  1cs  precative.  This  line  begins  the  prayer’s  final  section,  the  conditional  promise  of 
praise. The first two lines are stock phrases (see CAD A/2, 202–3). 

narbīka lušāpi 

Line 23: Dalīlīka from dalīlu, “praise, glory, fame.” It is common for dalīlu to be in the 
plural, particularly when referring to gods or kings and always when used with dalālu (see 
CAD D, 50). Dalālu, “to glorify, to proclaim.” Ludlul, like lušāpi, is a 1cs precative. Those 
who read or heard this very common doxological phrase would have been well aware of 
the binding consonance within and between these two words. While clumsy as a transla-
tion, “your praises, let me praise” is a reasonable representation of the vocabulary, gram-
mar, and to some extent consonance. 

dalīlīka ludlul 

Line 24: Āmirūya (from amāru, see line 18) is a G mp participle plus a 1cs pronominal 

suffix. The preposition ana governs the noun in the next line. 

āmirūya ana 

Line  25:  Dārītu,  “eternity,”  is  in  the  plural  here,  darâtu,  though  we  expect  a  gen., 
darâti. Ana darâti means “forever, eternally.” Maul (297, n.13) notes that one expects dalīlī 
with a 2ms pronominal suffix (–ka). The above notation indicates the scribe has mistaken-
ly omitted it. Note the alliteration between darâtu and dalīlīka that binds these words to-
gether in much the same way as dalīlīka ludlul are bound together by consonance both here

and in line 23. The whole phrase, darâtu dalīlīka lidlulū, is bound tightly by both allitera-
tion and consonance. 

ana darâtu dalīlīka 

Line 26: Although Maul adopts LID as the best reading, he suggests that the first sign 
in the line might be read NI (297). In other words, the first sign may be an example of the 
poorly attested líd reading. One’s decision on this does not affect the meaning. Maul’s copy  
appears to favor reading lid (542). Lidlulū is a 3mp precative from dalālu. The subject of 
dalālu  has  changed  from  the  supplicant,  line  23,  to  those  who  see  the  supplicant  here. 
TE.ÉN follows the prayer just as ÉN precedes it. Together they form an inclusio, delineating 
the beginning and the end of the prayer. 

lidlulū TE.ÉN 

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS: 

Shamash 25 deals with dispelling the evil portent of snakes, ṣerru, hunting 
in one’s house. While there are several different words for “snake” and “serpent” 
in  Hebrew, 
 ָנ ָחשׁ   is  the  most  frequently  used  and  is  likely  the  closest  semantic 
equivalent to Akkadian ṣerru (ṣēru). Jer 8:17 and Qoh 10:11 both mention spells 
(
 ַל ַחשׁ )  against  snakes.  However,  unlike  the  underlying  assumption  of  Shamash 
25, the Qohelet passage highlights the uselessness of the charmer after the snake 
bites. In the Jeremiah passage, it is Yahweh himself who will send uncharmable 
snakes.1  

In  much  the  same  way  as  Shamash  25,  biblical  Psalms  frequently  contain 
petitions followed by vows of praise. For example, Ps 7 begins with an invoca-
tion followed by a rather complex petition, including a lament, and ends with a 
vow of praise. Other psalms ending with vows or vow-like elements include Pss 
13, 14, 21, 22, 35, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 61, 69, 79 and 109.  

Although šar šamê u erṣetim in line 1 may be echoed in Jdt 9:12, and later 
theology  clearly  identified  the  Judean  and  Israelite  monotheistic  god  with  the 
king of heaven and earth, surprisingly the Hebrew Bible does not contain a pre-
cise parallel to šar šamê u erṣetim, “king of heaven and earth.” 1 Chron 29:10–12 
may well provide an extended paraphrase of the divine epithet. Zech 14:9 and 
Dan 4:34 separately reflect the two halves of the epithet: Zech 14:9 proclaims 
Yahweh, 
,  “king  over  all  the  earth,”  and  Dan  4:34  (in  Aramaic) 
 
1 Two incantations tablets treated by Finkel, “Incantations,” 223–29, may provide closer parallels 
to Jer 8:17b than does Shamash 25 (See CBS 7005:13 and IM 5192:2, cited in note 4 above). On 
snakes that cannot be conjured, see also the Sumerian Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld 
version  A,  lines  42,  85,  129,  and  140  (ur2-bi-a  muš tu6  nu-zu-a-e  gud3  im-ma-ni-ib-us2,  “At  its 
roots, a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest.” [ETCSL trans.]).

For the more general juxtaposition of “heavens” and “earth” in BH and Akkadian

cloak and it tore.” (Old Aramaic, ףנכב זחא, and Ugaritic, ʿḫd bsin, also reflect the 
expression.) To take hold of the hem is an act of both submission and allegiance. 
Tearing the hem implies rejection.3 
 
2 Most MSS of Jdt 9:12 read δέσποτα τῶν οὐρανῶν καὶ τῆς γῆς but Codex Alexandrinus reads βασιλευς. 
The larger context of Judith is Assyrian hegemony but it is hard to know the extent to which, if 
at all, the passage echoes the Akkadian divine epithet. G. Brooke Lester noted this possible paral-
lel in a private communication. Of interest in this regard is Ps 103:19 where Yahweh is said to 
have “established His throne in heaven and His sovereign rule is over all” (JPS).  
3  On the tearing of a hem in  an  Akkadian prayer, see page 184,  line 8 and related  discussion 
there.  Tawil,  “Hebrew  ד ַי  ץ ֵפ ַנ,”  79–82  argues  that  די  ץפנ  in  Dan  12:7,  reflecting  Akkadian  qāta 
napāṣu, “to thrust away the hand,” also has this negative connotation.

Dingirshadibbas to Personal Deities 

ALAN LENZI 

THE PERSONAL GOD / GODDESS: 

Personal deities, both gods and goddesses, were generally minor deities in 
the Mesopotamian pantheon that, as the name implies, had special significance 
to an individual (henceforth, the protégé).1 The personal deities were the creator 
(bānû) and protector (nāṣiru) of the protégé. They cared (rāʾimu) for the protégé, 
sustained their well-being (balāṭu), secured and maintained their social position 
(via a šumu damqu, “a good name”), and generally granted the protégé success in 
their  varied  endeavors,  both  personal  and  professional  (ila  rašû,  “to  obtain  a 
god” means “to have success, good fortune,” see CAD R, 194). In many respects, 
the personal god was a kind of projection of the protégé’s parents onto the di-
vine  sphere.  Given  the  function  and  importance  of  the  personal  gods,  people 
owed them reverence and respect (ila palāḫu, “to fear the god,” and ila karābu, 
“to bless the god, to greet the god in an honored manner”2). If the individual did 
something wrong, the personal deity could become angry and abandon the pro-
tégé.  Or,  if  the protégé  was experiencing  difficulties  of  some  kind,  they might 
believe these to be the result of the personal god’s anger and abandonment. In 
any  case,  the  anger  and/or  abandonment  of  the  personal  god  left  the  protégé 
without protection, open to further hardships or afflictions. The protégé would 
therefore pray to the deity directly (as in dingirshadibba-prayers) or ask another 
deity to intercede on their behalf (as in many shuilla-prayers) in order to soothe 
the god’s anger and renew amicable fellowship. 

Although  personal  deities  had  a  special  relationship  to  individuals,  they 
were not conceived in strictly individualistic terms like present-day imaginings 
of guardian angels. Rather, the veneration of the personal god always took place 
in a familial or communal context. In many respects, the personal god is more 
like a family god. As such, the personal god could act as a witness to legal set-
tlements  and  an  enforcer  in  family  disputes  or  problems.  The  choice  of  one’s 
 
1  This section is especially indebted to van der Toorn’s work, which is the best treatment of the 
personal god currently available. 
2  For more on this ritual act, which is more complicated than the English word conveys, see van 
der Toorn, 113 and the general introduction, page 30.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

personal god—or rather the god’s identity since there was little choice normal-
ly—was  typically  restricted  to  the  personal  deity  of  one’s  parents.  This  is  evi-
denced at times by the same theophoric element in personal names from genera-
tion to generation within a family. But the selection of a personal deity may also 
have been contingent upon other factors: local (e.g., a nearby temple or shrine) 
or occupational (e.g., many scribes took Nabu or Nisaba as their personal deity). 
A woman, upon marriage, would give up revering the god of her father (ili abīša) 
for that of her husband (ili bēlīša), showing again the familial association of the 
personal god.  

Although  personal  gods  were  usually  minor  or  tertiary  deities  within  the 
Mesopotamian pantheon (e.g., Ninshubur, Ishtar’s vizier, was a common person-
al  god,  whereas  Ishtar  herself  is  never  attested  as  a  personal  god  nor  is  Anu), 
there are exceptions. For example, Enlil, one of the chief gods of the pantheon, 
on occasion took the role of an individual’s personal god. It seems, however, that 
this practice was generally limited to kings. 

THE PRAYER:  

This  treatment  includes  two  brief  examples  of  dingirshadibba-prayers.  In 
fact,  the  division  of  the  Akkadian  text  into  two  rather  than  three  incantation-
prayers  is  not  unanimous  among  the  textual  witnesses.  The  issue  revolves 
around the division of the material in lines 18–31 of this treatment. Some MSS in 
Lambert’s edition preserve a rule line between our lines 21 and 22, suggesting 
lines 18–21 and lines 22–31 be counted as two prayers instead of one. (Thus, the 
material  treated  here  would  contain  three  prayers:  1–17,  18–21,  and  22–31.) 
Two  MSS  leave this  ruling out  and  therefore  see  the material  in lines  18–31  as 
one prayer. (Thus, we have two prayers in the material treated here: 1–17 and 
18–31.) Lambert’s MS K rearranges the material we identify as lines 18–31 as if it 
were dealing with two blocks of text, two prayers: our lines 22–31 occur before 
lines 18–21 on the tablet and a rule line separates the two textual blocks. In an-
other vein of support for dividing lines 18–31 into two prayers, Lambert’s MS B 
includes (a broken) ÉN (šiptu) at the head of line 22, indicating the start of a new 
incantation. But this is ambiguous evidence since MS B skips line 32 (the rubric) 
and continues uninterrupted into what the other textual witness to this material 
considers a separate prayer (i.e., Lambert’s MS K has a ruling after its placement 
of our line 21, indicating a break before the next incantation-prayer on the tab-
let  [not  included  here]).  This  textual  diversity  should  come  as  no  surprise  to 
anyone working with incantation-prayers. As a matter of convenience, the pre-
sent  treatment  follows  previous  translators  in  treating  the  following  thirty-one 
lines of Akkadian as two prayers. 

The  first  prayer  begins  with  a  brief  invocation  of  the  personal  god  and  a 
statement of the supplicant’s ignorance of the severity of the god’s punishment 
(note the predicative verb, dannat). The supplicant’s ignorance, commonly found 
in penitential contexts, is a theme throughout the first half of the prayer. In the 
next five lines the supplicant confesses their sins using mostly Gtn preterites or G

perfects—the forms are ambiguous. This confession culminates in line 7, which 
summarizes the supplicant’s sins (using a predicative verb, mādū) and reiterates 
their ignorance, though this time the ignorance refers to what they actually did. 
Line 7 recalls the first line of the prayer in its use of a predicative and its reprise 
of  the  supplicant’s  ignorance.  Lines  8–10  contain  the  first  wave  of  petitions. 
These are directed only to the personal god (not the goddess) and are centered 
on forgiveness of sins. Lines 11–12 are another confession of sorts but not of sin. 
Rather, in words that recall line 1 (again) the supplicant confesses in line 11, or 
rather  professes,  to  understanding  and  having  experienced (amāru)  the  severity 
(note the predicative, dannat) of the god’s punishment (šēretka). This, they assert 
in line 12, makes them a model from which other sinners should learn (amāru). 
Having made this profession, the supplicant renews their attempts in lines 13–16 
to reconcile with their deities via a series of petitions. The first two petitions are 
directed separately to each of the personal deities, one to the god and one (the 
first  in  the  prayer)  to  the  goddess  (line  13).  The  remaining  petitions  are  ad-
dressed to both deities (lines 14–16). The prayer concludes with a long and em-
phatic promise of praise (line 17). 

The second prayer begins with an invocation that is rather long for a ding-
irshadibba-prayer. Five different phrases over two lines (18–19) invoke the dei-
ty. All of these epithets are related to the supplicant in a personal manner, which 
is quite unlike the epithets in the hymnic introduction to shuilla-prayers. Follow-
ing  this  invocation  are  two  formulaic  petitions  addressed  to  the  personal  god 
and  goddess,  respectively.  Since  only  the  god  was  invoked  in  lines  18–19  and 
the remainder of the text is addressed to him alone (note the 2ms pronominal 
suffixes), this couplet creates a disjunction in the text. Lines 22–23 describe hu-
man ignorance, both generally and the supplicant’s particularly, with regard to 
the divine abode in preparation for the prayer’s only expression of lament in line 
24. Without the divine presence, the  supplicant  complains in line 24,  they are 
helpless.  The prayer concludes with a  series of petitions in lines 25–31 (and a 
ritual meal in line 26). In these lines the supplicant tries to convince the god to 
relent from his  anger and restore the supplicant’s life (balāṭu, see lines 28, 30, 
31)—long life, according to line 31. The first four lines of this block (lines 25–
28) sequentially mention four parts of the god’s body associated with the head 
(i.e., neck, face, lips, and mouth). The last of these is the means for carrying out 
the supplicant’s requests in lines  27b, 28b, and 30 (note the verbs:  qabû twice 
and šâmu). Unlike the previous  example, this prayer does not  conclude with a 
promise of praise. 

As  Lambert  has  noted,  both  of  these  dingirshadibba-prayers  are  known  to 
have been used in specific ritual complexes. KAR 90, rev. 4 cites the incipit of 
our first prayer (among eight other cited incipits) in the course of the ritual it 
calls “my god I did not know” (nēpeši ilī ul īde, 269), and both prayers’ incipits 
are cited in the first tablet of the ritual series Bīt rimki (in Zimmern, BBR, no. 26 
v 81; see Lambert, 268).

irshadibba-prayers with their rituals. She also addresses their reception history and reuse.

Line 1:  ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording,” indicates to the user of the tablet 
that a prayer or incantation follows. It is not part of the prayer proper. DINGIR = ilu, “god.” 
MU  =  1cs  pronominal  suffix,  “my.”  Unlike  the  shuilla-prayers,  the  invocation  in  ding-
irshadibba-prayers is always short; they are typically limited to a vocative and perhaps an 
epithet or two (contrast lines 18–19 in the second prayer). Edû, idû, “to know.” The suppli-
cant admits ignorance several times in the course of the prayer (see lines 6 and 7). Šērtu, 
“guilt, punishment.” Danānu, “to be(come) strong.”  
 
   
Line  2:  Nīšu,  literally,  “life,”  but  idiomatically  “oath.”  Kabtu,  “heavy,  grave,  im-
portant.” Qalliš, “lightly, slightly,” seems in this context to denote a lack of respect for the 
deity invoked, which brings the traditional language of the Decalogue to mind: “in vain.” 
Zakāru, “to speak, to name, to invoke,” with nīšu, “to swear an oath” (lit. “to invoke the 
life [nīšu] of” a deity, king, or someone). The 2ms pronominal suffix in our line replaces 
the expected ili, “god,” because the supplicant is addressing the one on whom they have 
sworn. See CAD Z, 19–20 for the idiom. The verb may look like an N stem (azzakkar), but 
a passive would not make sense in this context. Rather, the verb can be either a G perfect 
(azzakar) or Gtn preterite (azzakkar; see also lines 3a, 4, and 5 but note the simple preter-
ite in  line 3b).  One’s  decision about  these  verbs  will affect  one’s translation and  under-

standing of the nature of the supplicant’s sin. (Previous translations vary. See, e.g., Foster, 
722, who reads perfects throughout, and Seux, 203, who reads a perfect in line 2 but Gtn 
preterites  in  lines 3–5.)  The  –zz–  is a  result  of  the assimilation  of  the infixed –t– to  the 
sibiliant (z) first radical of the root. The line is a stock phrase found elsewhere (Lambert, 
294). See, e.g., line 87 in Lambert’s edition of the dingirshadibba-prayers (278) and Ludlul 
II 22. 
 
   
Line 3: Mû, “divine decree, cultic ordinance, cosmic rule,” comes from the Sumerian 
word  me  (see  Gertrud  Farber-Flügge,  Der  Mythos  “Inanna  und  Enki”  unter  besonderer 
Berücksichtigung  der  Liste  der  m e .  [Studi  Pohl  10;  Rome:  Biblical  Institute  Press,  1973], 
116–64). Mêšu, “to disregard, to neglect” (see CAD M/2, 41–42 for other examples of this 
verb with reference to the gods). Magal, “(very) much, exceedingly,” also appears in lines 
5 and 6. CAD M/1, 31 notes that this word, when it is used in SB Akkadian, typically oc-
curs  several  times  in  the  context.  Alāku,  “to  go.”  Given  the  other  verbs  in  context  (and 
depending on one’s decision about them), one might expect a perfect here rather than the 
preterite. A Gtn form of the verb would not make sense in this context, “I walked about all 
the time” (see CAD M/1, 29 for attestations). The last half of the line seems to be a meta-
phorical restatement of the first. (For another use of magal with alāku in the dingirshadib-
ba-prayers, see Lambert, 280, line 127: magal allak.) 
 
   
Line 4: Šipru, “task, work, product, mission, message, action, affliction.” The context 
does not allow an easy decision about this word’s precise meaning here. Danna/ātu has a 
spectrum of meanings in the semantic domain of “hard, difficult.” Meanings range through 
“difficulty,  distress,  famine,”  “fortified  place,”  “foundation,”  “binding  (agreement),”  and 
“strict or harsh (words),” among other, more technical meanings (see CAD D, 87–91 and 
CDA, 56). The meaning of the last word in the line, certainly a 1cs verb, is unclear. AHw, 
1208, s.v. šeʾēru suggests the verb might be a denominative from šeʾru, “pock-marked.” But 
this suggestion does not provide a sensible translation in our context. CAD Š/2, 259 does 
not give a meaning, but it may be significant for other interpretive decisions in our context 
that the one unbroken attestation of the verb occurs in the Gtn stem. Foster guesses the 
verb means “I skirted” (722). Without a clear meaning for the verb, it is difficult to know 
how to translate the other two, rather general terms in the line. My translation therefore 
must  be  considered  very  tentative.  In any  case,  given the  surrounding  lines,  we may as-
sume the line conveys a negative act committed by the supplicant. 
 
   
itâ etēqu means “to trespass, to transgress.” 
 

Line 5: Itû, “boundary, border.” Etēqu, “to cross over, to pass through.” Idiomatically,

Line 6: See line 1 for ul īde, which occurs again in line 7. The partially preserved AN 
sign allows us to infer that the last part of this line also begins with a 1cs verb (as in lines 
2–5). But no likely restorations have been suggested. 
 
   
Line 7: Mâdu, “to be(come) many, to be(come) numerous.” The form is a 3mp predic-
ative. Arnu, “guilt, fault, sin.” Ēma, usually means “wherever,” but in our context it seems 
to mean “what.” Epēšu, “to do.” The 1cs verb ēpušu ends with the subjunctive –u because it 
is in a relative clause (starting with ēma). The verb īde is formally a preterite but context 
must determine its tense. (There is no durative form.) 
 
   
Line 8: The petition section of the prayer begins with the repetition of the invocation 
(ilī, “my god”) and a series of imperatives. Pasāsu, “to cancel, to annul.” We expect a ms 
impv. here (as with the following two verbs); thus, pusus. Three MSS inexplicably read the 
fs impv., pussī, instead. The two MSS, however, that we are following, add the ventive to a 
ms impv.: pussa.  Paṭāru, “to  loosen, to undo, to release.” Pašāru,  “to loosen, to undo,  to 
release.” Both pašāru and paṭāru (less often pasāsu) are used in contexts dealing with the 
forgiveness of sins or the release from sickness/demonic oppression (CAD P, 219, 237–39, 
290–92). Kiṣru is literally a “knot, bond, lump,” but it is often used with libbu as a meta-
phor  for  anger.  Libbu is literally the “heart,” but it also means “seat  of emotions and/or 
volition.” The anger of the deity must be assuaged before the supplicant can ask for any-
thing further (see lines 9 and 10). 
 

ilī pussa puṭur pušur kiṣir libbīka 

mādū arnūya ēma ēpušu ul īde 

mēša gillātīya liqe unnīnīya 

 
Line 9: The supplicant asks the deity here to mêšu their sins just as the supplicant had 
done with the deity’s ordinances in line 3.  Gillatu, “sin, sacrilege.” Leqû, “to take, to re-
ceive.”  Unnīnu, “prayer, petition.” This  line encapsulates the desires of  the supplicant in 
terms of negative and positive acts: the deity’s forgetting (–) of the supplicants past acts (–) 
and the deity’s acceptance (+) of the present plea (+). 
 
   
Line 10: Šakānu, “to place, to set, to put.” With ana the verb means “to turn X (the 
verb’s  object)  into  (ana)  Y.”  Ḫīṭu,  “error,  sin,  crime.”  Damqu,  “good,  favor,  virtue.”  The 
supplicant  now  asks  for  the  past  sins  to  be transformed  into  virtues,  rather  than  simply 
disregarded, as in line 9.

Line 11: The text harks back to the opening line of the prayer with the words dannat 
and šēretka. But now the words are distributed across the two halves of the line rather than 
placed together, as in line 1.  ŠU = qātu, “hand;”  ŠU.II  indicates both hands (see lines 12 
and 14). Amāru, “to see,” but can also mean “to experience.”  
 
   
Line 12: Palāḫu, “to fear, to reverence.” d15 = ištaru, “goddess.” “God and goddess,” 
as one might suppose, often appear together in Akkadian prayers and rituals and can be 
treated  as  one  grammatical  unit.  Pāliḫ  is  bound  to  both  genitives.  The  idiom  ina  qātīya 
amāru, literally, “to see in or by my hands,” means “to learn from.” The volitional form of 
the verb changes to a precative since a third party (not the deity) is in view. The idea con-
tained in this line is also expressed in Ludlul III, line p. 
 
   
Line 13: The supplicant calls on the god (see also lines 1 and 8) and the goddess (here 
for the first time). They direct a nearly synonymous  petition  in the form  of a  command 
(impv.) at each one individually. Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace, to be(come) reconciled.” 
Our text  follows Lambert’s  MS A here (si-lim). Napšarī is an N-stem fs impv.  from  pašāru 
(see line 8). 
 
   
Line 14: The supplicant now addresses the personal deities as a unit, again with an 
impv.  Tēnīnu,  “prayer,  supplication”  (see  CAD  T,  343),  is  better  than  CDA’s  “weeping, 
lamentation”  (404).  Nīšu,  “lifting,”  is  to  be  distinguished  from  the  homonym  in  line  2. 
Here  we  see the up-lifted  hands as a gesture  for  prayer. Suḫḫuru (D of saḫāru),  “to turn 
(away, toward).” Pānu, “face.” One might experiment with more idiomatic renderings of 
the line. What does it mean to ask someone to turn their face toward a person in a time of 
need? 
 
   
Line 15: Aggu, “Furious.” The adjective precedes the noun that it modifies, libbu. This 
is not unusual in Akkadian poetic texts. Nâḫu, “to be at rest, to calm down, to relent.” The 
verb is 3fp. The subject, libbakunu, is grammatically singular but must be taken as a collec-
tive, as the 2mp pronominal suffix suggests. See likewise kabattakunu in line 16. Lambert’s 
MS K reads  libbaka (note the 2ms suffix) in the first half of the line and then adds ištaru 
zenītu silmī (SILIM-me) ittīya, “O angry goddess, be at peace with me”; see line 21 below.

Line 16: The N-stem of pašāru is also used in line 13. Kabattu, literally, “liver,” often 
has the sense of “mood, temperament,” especially in a context that also attests libbu. SILIM 
= salīmu, “peace, reconciliation, favor.” For šakānu, see line 10. Here the verb must mean 
something like “order, grant.” Lines 15 and 16a utilize the precative, as they express wish-
es about the deities’ moods and attitudes. Line 16b returns to the dominating imperative 
(see lines 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14). 
 
   
Line  17:  Ša  lā,  “without.”  Mašû,  “to  forget.”  Dalīlū,  “praises.”  Šitammuru  (Gtn  of 
šamāru), “to praise, to extol (constantly ?).” See CAD Š/1, 297–98 for the slippage between 
the Gt and Gtn forms. UN.MEŠ = nišū (f), “people, populace.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu 
(f), “wide.” On an interesting twist to the common “promise of praise” formula at the end 
of many Akkadian prayers, our text explicitly mentions not forgetting to fulfill the promise 
and indicates that the praise will be public. 
 
   
Line 18: The second incantation (ÉN) begins here. Bēlu, “lord.” Banû, “to build, cre-
ate.” MU = šumu, “name.” “To create someone’s name” means to engender them, to give 
them existence. A prescriptive grammatical approach to the text might lead us to expect 
bāni šumīya; that is, we might expect the participle to be bound to the genitive and not in 
the nominative case. See likewise the second half of line 19. In SB Akkadian, however, a 
participle from a III-weak root in construct with a following substantive often ends with –û 
(see  Brigitte  R.  M.  Groneberg,  Syntax,  Morphologie  und  Stil  der  jungbabylonischen  „hym-
nischen“  Literatur,  2  Vols.  [Freiburger  Altorientalische  Studien  14/1–2;  Stuttgart:  Franz 
Steiner Verlag, 1987], 1.95). The first two lines of this prayer begin with five epithets of 
the personal god—more than usual for dingirshadibba-prayers. Each epithet directly and 
personally relates to the supplicant. Compare the shuilla-prayers, where the epithets tend 
to relate to the deity’s position within the pantheon or to the deity’s temple. 
 
    
Line 19: Naṣāru, “to guard, to watch.” Napištu, “life.” Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to cause to 
be, to create.” Mušabšû is a participle, parallel with the epithet at the beginning of the line 
(nāṣir).  NUMUN  =  zēru,  “seed,  progeny.”  This  prayer  shows  just  how  closely  šumu 
(“name”), napištu (“life”), and zēru (“seed”) were associated in ancient Mesopotamia.

Line 20: See line 15 above. In the prayer’s first petitions (lines 20 and 21), the suppli-
cant’s personal deities—god as well as goddess,  in contrast to the  prayer’s  invocation in 
lines 18 and 19—are invoked (again). 

ilu aggu libbakunu linūḫā 

Line 21: Zenû (m), zenītu (f), “angry.” KI = itti, “with.” 
ištaru zenītu silmī ittīya 

    
 
    
Line 22: Mannu, “who.” Šubtu, “dwelling, seat.” In some MSS a new prayer starts with 
this line, indicated by the rule line that comes before it (lacking in two MSS). Though lack-
ing in the majority of the MSS, ÉN is partially present in one MS. See the introduction to the 
prayer above. The (reprised) invocation is a simple vocative, ilī, “my god.” The question is 
rhetorical, intended indirectly to place the supplicant within general human ignorance of 
divine things. 
 
    
Line 23: Mazzāzu (manzāzu), “position, abode, location.” Ellu, “clear, clean, (ritually) 
pure,” sometimes translated “holy.” Kummu, “cella, shrine, innermost room.” Matīma, “at 
any time, ever, never.” Amrāku is an active stative (or, a “transitive parsāku construction,” 
in Huehnergard’s grammar) from amāru (see line 11). Manzāzu and kummu further define 
the more general term šubtu in line 22. Now the supplicant directly admits personal igno-
rance  of  the  divine  abode.  Lines  22  and  23  move  from  the  general  to  the  particular  in 
terms of both the location of the deity and those ignorant of it. Both lines begin with the 
same syllable, which binds the two together phonologically. 
 
    
Line 24: Kīma ginâ, “constantly, always.” Šuʾduru (Š of adāru), “to cause annoyance, 
to frighten;” the verb is used to convey something about mood or state of mind, such as 
fright, despondency, or gloominess (see CAD A/1, 105). In contrast to the sublime divine 
abode, the supplicant is in utter misery. Mêš, “where?” The final question in this line is not 
so much rhetorical (as in line 1) as petitioning. But the supplicant is not actually interested 
in where the deity has gone, of course; rather, the supplicant really wants to know why the 
god is not nearby.

Line 25:  Turru (D of târu), “to turn (a part of the body),” see CAD T, 273–75; with 
kišādu,  “neck,”  as  object,  the  verb  means  “to  turn  back,  to  relent”  (see  275,  with  other 
examples). The –a on the end of the imperative form is the ventive. Šabāsu, “to be angry,” 
also has kišādu, the referent of the relative ša, as object (see CAD Š/1, 5), in which case the 
idiom means “to turn away in anger.” UGU = eli, “against, on, upon.” The line, therefore, 
means literally, “turn back your neck which you turned away in anger against me.” Like 
the one preceding it, this line is both a description of the sufferer’s plight as well as a peti-
tion to change it, though the latter is foregrounded. 
 
    
Line 26: Suḫḫuru, (D of saḫāru), see line 14. Used with pānu, the verb can denote a 
positive or negative action (see CAD S, 49–50). The ventive on the verb confirms what the 
context  requires,  a turning  toward.  In  parallel  with  line  25,  the  supplicant  petitions  the 
deity for favor using the language of turning. KÙ = ellu (see line 23). The adjective again 
precedes the noun that it modifies (see also line 15). Mākālû, “meal, food,” with reference 
to  a deity (note the genitive  ili,  which may be translated as an adjective here, “divine”) 
means “offering.” Ulû šamni, “the best oil” (see AHw, 1411 and CDA, 421 s.v. ulû), is in 
apposition to mākālê ili and defines the items presented in the offering. Here the text of the 
prayer gives us a window onto the ritual action that accompanied it: the setting out of an 
offering of choice oil. 
 
    
Line  27:  Šaptā,  “lips”  (nom.  dual).  Ṭūbu,  “goodness,”  is  the  object  of  the  transitive 
verb  maḫāru,  “to  receive.”  Qabû,  “to  speak,  to  command.”    Ešēru,  “to  be  straight,  to  go 
well, to be well, to prosper.” The first part of the line describes the result of the suppli-
cant’s petition for the deity to turn toward the offering in line 26: so he may receive it. The 
end  of  the  line,  paralleling  the  syntax  of  imperative  +  precative  of  the  previous  two 
phrases,  shows  what  the  supplicant  wants  (expects  ?)  in  exchange  for  the  offering:  they 
want a divine decree that will result in prosperity. 
 
    
Line  28:  Pû,  “mouth.”  TI.LA  =  balāṭu,  “life,  health,  well-being.”  The  petition  for  a 
divine decree (qibi) is repeated, though this time with a more direct request (imperative + 
object rather than imperative + precative): the  supplicant wants life.  The deity’s mouth 
becomes the instrument of action rather than the beneficiary of the supplicant’s offering 
(i.e., the deity’s lips received the offering in line 27).

Line 29: Á = idu, “side, arm, strength.” Literally, ina idu means “on the side of,” but it 
functions as a preposition meaning “from” and need not be translated literally (see CAD 
I/J,  14).  MUNUS.ḪUL  =  lemuttu,  “wickedness,  evil.”  Šūtuqu  (Š  of  etēqu),  “to  make  X  pass 
by.” N of eṭēru, “to be rescued, to be saved.” The reading of the two verbs adopted here 
comes from Lambert’s MS B (see 277, n.51). Itti, “with.” What does it mean to be rescued 
“with” the deity? The deity’s renewed attention and presence will give protection to the 
supplicant as they escape the evil that has beset them (see CAD E, 403, which explains the 
preposition  with  “i.e.,  protected  by”).  The  syntagm  imperative  +  precative  (as  result) 
returns in this line. The ina phrase at the head of our line grammatically parallels the one 
in line 28 (ina + body part + modifier); semantically, however, the two are quite distinct. 
The deity’s mouth was an instrument of salvation; the evil power is that from which the 
supplicant needs saving. 
 
    
Line 30: Šâmu, “to decree, to appoint, to ordain.” Šīmtu, “fate, destiny.” The first two 
words  form  a  cognate  accusative.  Like  line  28,  the  supplicant  asks  for  life  or  health 
(balāṭu). Here, however, the use of šâmu and its cognate šīmtu seems more emphatic. 
 
    
Line 31: UD.MEŠ = umū, “days.” Urruku (D of arāku), “to lengthen.” Qâšu, “to give, to 
grant.” The first phrase helps us understand the full meaning of balāṭu in this and the pre-
ceding  lines.  The  supplicant  is  not  only  asking  for  health  but also  an  extension  of  their 
days.  The  prayer’s  petitions  are  firmly  rooted  in  the  mortal  life  of  the  supplicant.  They 
wish that life to be longer. 
 
    
Line 32: The scribe inadvertently omitted the RU sign. This line is the rubric, that is, 
it  tells  something about  the  classification  of  the  preceding  lines.  In  this  case,  the  rubric 
identifies the kind of prayers on the tablet. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. 
It may be translated, “it is the wording for appeasing the angry heart of a god.”

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
Before delving into a broader comparative point about the prayer’s form, I 
first note a few parallels between the language of our Akkadian prayer and what 
is found in the Hebrew Bible. First, the use of the phrase itâ etēqu in the sense of 
“to trespass, to transgress” in line 5 is similar to the semantic range of the BH 
root רבע. I discuss this parallel on page 308. The phrase nāṣir napištīya, “the one 
who guards my life,” in line 19 finds an etymological equivalent in BH שׁ ֶפ ֶנ ר ֵצֹנ. 
In  Prov  24:12  we read  about  the  deity  as   ְשׁ ְפ ַנ  ר ֵצֹנ,  “the  one  who  guards  your

life” (see Tawil, ALCBH, 244). Finally, in the second line of our prayer the sup-
plicant  confesses  “I  repeatedly  swore  a  solemn  oath  on  your  life  in  vain  (lit., 
lightly)”  (nīška  kabtu  qalliš  azzakkar).  Semantically,  this  is  very  close  to  the 
Decalogue’s  commandment  about  pronouncing  (literally,  lifting  [אשׂנ])1  the  di-
vine name א ְו ָשּׁ ַל, “in a worthless or groundless manner, in vain” (Exod 20:7, Deut 
5:11).2 Although the biblical text does not explicitly mention swearing, the idi-
om “to lift a name” may have originally been its equivalent or, rather, a broader 
action that subsumed it. In any case, earliest interpretations seem to have identi-
fied the commandment with a prohibition on swearing falsely.3 These similari-
ties in language once again suggest the conceptual proximity of Mesopotamian 
and ancient Israelite religious worldviews. 
 
Shuilla-prayers typically begin with a long hymnic introduction,  which, as 
argued in the general introduction, is part of the formal greeting appropriate for 
addressing a high god in the pantheon. We have seen how this formal greeting is 
also reflected in some of the prayers of the Hebrew Bible on page 238. In con-
trast to shuillas, the dingirshadibba-prayers attest very brief invocations, some-
times as brief as one word, “my god” (ilī, see line 1). When epithets are used, 
they are few and always reflect the personal nature of the relationship between 
the  personal  god  and  the  supplicant  (see,  e.g.,  lines  18–19).  As  I  have  argued 
elsewhere,4  one  need  not  formally  address  one’s  personal  god  in  a  dingirsha-
dibba as one would a high god in a shuilla because one is already on intimate, 
informal  terms  with the personal  deity.  This  same mode of  brief  and  informal 
address may be seen in the Psalter’s laments of the individual (3; 5; 6; 7; 13; 17; 
22; 25; 26; 27:7–14; 28; 31; 35; 38; 39; 42; 43; 51; 54; 55; 56; 57; 59; 61; 63; 
64;  69; 70; 71; 86; 88; 102; 109; 120; 130; 140; 141; 142; and 143).5 In most 
laments of the individual  the  invocation  is  simply 
 ָוֹהה ,  “O  Yahweh”  (see,  e.g., 
Pss 3:2 and 6:2), or 
, “O God” (see, e.g., 43:1 and 51:3 in the Elohistic Psal-
ter).  Other  invocations  are  just  as  short,  consisting  of  a  single  word  (Ps  59:2, 
, “O my god”), or only slightly longer with brief invocations in parallelism

1  The BH use of אשׂנ in the phrase ם ֵשׁ אשׂנ, “to pronounce a name,” is similar to the Akkadian use 
of the cognate verb našû in the phrase šipta/šuʾillakka našû, “to recite an incantation/a shuilla” 
(see Tawil, ALCBH,  249–50 and CAD N/2, 108–9).  An even  closer  equivalent to the Akkadian 
phrase is BH’s  ה ָלּ ִפ ְתּ אשׂנ in, e.g., 2 Kgs 19:4. 
2  See HALOT, 1425–26. The word was not originally equivalent to “falsely,” though it was even-
tually understood in that way. See the next note.

mode of address between the dingirshadibba-prayers and the laments of the in-
dividual  and  in  light  of  what  others  have  suggested  about  the  familial  Sitz  im 
Leben  and  personal  content  of  the  biblical  laments  of  the  individual,7  it  seems

ing a role akin to the Mesopotamian personal god.

An Ershaḫunga to Any God 

CHARLES HALTON 

THE DEITY ADDRESSED: 

 
Unlike  other  prayers  from  Mesopotamia  this  prayer  is  not  addressed  to  a 
specific,  named  deity.  This  suggests  the petitioner  did  not know  which  god or 
goddess they had offended, so they went to great lengths to frame the supplica-
tion in an inclusive manner. For instance, almost every plea is repeated in order 
to  include  both  genders,  and  the  petitioner  even  included  supplications  to  ac-
count for an unknown deity. Although the petitioner did not direct their prayer 
to a specific deity, the prayer was nonetheless intended for the particular god or 
goddess  that  was  offended.  Early  translations  of  this  prayer,  such  as  in  ANET, 
titled it “Prayer to Every God,” as if the plea was directed at every deity. How-
ever, as Morton Smith rightly observes, 

The composition entitled “Prayer to Every God” should have been entitled “Prayer to 
Any God”—it is not addressed “to all gods in general,” [Smith refers to the introduc-
tion to this prayer in ANET], but to that one god or goddess whom the petitioner sup-
poses to be punishing him or her and it is significant that the petitioner takes it for 
granted that this unknown deity is singular.1 

Since Smith’s critique, most editors have adopted the interpretation and title he 
suggested.  

THE PRAYER:  

The colophon of this text identifies it as an ershaḫunga-prayer, “lament for 
appeasing the heart (of a deity).”2 Generally, these prayers do not include a spe-
cific request such as relief from a disease or demon; instead, they seek reconcili-
ation  with  an  angry  deity.  Furthermore,  ershaḫunga-prayers  avoid  mentioning 
particular sins or transgressions as the petitioner recounts a more generic confes-
sion.  
 
A  full  picture  of  the  rituals  associated  with  the  ershaḫunga-prayers  is  not 
available, but a few details are known. In contrast to balags, ershemas and Su-

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

merian  shuilla-prayers,  ershaḫunga-prayers  were  never  sung  (zamāru).  Rather, 
the ershaḫunga-prayers were made (epēšu), spoken (dabābu), recited (manû), and 
lifted  up  (našû).3  Even  though  ershaḫunga-prayers  were  not  sung,  kettledrums 
often accompanied their recitation. Furthermore, ershaḫunga-prayers were recit-
ed  along  with  other  forms  of  laments  and  prayers  during rituals  such  as  for  a 
substitute  king.4  (See  page  43  in  the  general  introduction  for  more  about  er-
shaḫunga-prayers.) 
 
Originally, the present prayer was composed in Sumerian, but at some point 
most lines were furnished  with an interlinear Akkadian  translation,  which will 
be the focus of this treatment. A handful of lines or parts of lines were left un-
translated, but this primarily occurs in sentences that repeat something or con-
tain  only  a  minor  change  from  the  previous  line  that  was  translated  (such  as 
shifting the gender of the subject). In these cases, the scribe apparently assumed 
the translation would be self-evident. I have filled in these assumed translations 
with an approximated Akkadian text and placed them inside {braces}. The last 
seven lines of the prayer appear only in Sumerian and do not follow the above 
rationale. They are not analyzed in this treatment.5 

The prayer begins with what Maul has labeled the “type C” introductory lit-
any in which the supplicant seeks with a series of precatives to move the deity to 
act on their behalf.6 The first line of the prayer is one of the few petitions within 
the bilingual section that is not repeated to a female deity. It should be seen as 
an introductory statement summarizing the request that the deity be reconciled 
to  the  petitioner.  Lines  2–10  repeat  the  plea  that  the  deity’s  anger  subside  so 
that the relationship may return to status quo and by implication alleviate what-
ever hardship the petitioner is suffering. Although lines 11–16 are broken, the 
lament section of the prayer probably starts here and continues through line 38. 
Based  on  the  scant  clues  that  remain  in  lines  11–16,  the  supplicant  seems  to 
mention their sin and something related to a favorable name, a common Meso-
potamian  concern.7  In  lines  17–20  the  petitioner  confesses  deep  anguish  and 
remorse concerning the sins that they committed in ignorance. They confess that 
 
3  Maul, HB, 25–26. 
4  See Parpola, LASEA 2, nos. 259 and 351.  
5  It may be interpretively significant that the end of the prayer consists of seven lines of untrans-
lated Sumerian since the number seven is central to the petitioner’s plea within this section: 

My god, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins. 
My goddess, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins. 
Whichever god, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins. 
Whichever goddess, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins. 
Forgive my sins, let me sing your praise. 
As if you were my mother, let your heart be reconciled to me. 
As if you were my mother or my father, let your heart be reconciled to me. 

6  Maul, HB, 18 and n.45. 
7  Foster, following Falkenstein (226), reasonably suggests lines 11–12 are a confession of igno-
rance of sin and lines 13–16 are a lament that neither god nor goddess called or pronounced the 
supplicant’s name with favor (763). 

 

ӎӘ AN ERSHAHUNGA TO ANY GOD 

449 

their sins were many and great in lines 21–25. This confession is followed with a 
series of four statements that assert the petitioner’s ignorance of the offence (26–
29). In line 30 the supplicant begins a description of the woes that have lead up 
to  the  current  plight.  The  supplicant  starts  with  the  initial  anger  of  the  deity 
(lines 30–32) and then moves on to the bodily consequences of this anger (lines 
33–34):  the  supplicant  became  sick.  Lines  35–37  recount  the  supplicant’s  at-
tempts to seek aid. But the futility of these attempts has left them in the current 
condition of misery (line 38). Lines 39–46 are identified by Maul as a transition 
between the lament and the petition section  proper.8 In these  lines the suppli-
cant describes their current actions in turning to the deity for help.9 Lines 47–55 
comprise the petition section proper. A series of “how long” questions (lines 47–
50) are followed by the petitioner again reiterating their ignorance in commit-
ting  the  offence  (lines  51–53).  The  petition  section  culminates  with  two  final, 
self-referential pleas (line 54–55). The last three lines of Akkadian (lines 56–58) 
and the first four of the final seven lines in Sumerian (see n. 5 above) replace the 
typical  intercessory  litany  often  found  in  ershaḫunga-prayers  with  a  litany  for 
the removal of sin.10 The fifth line of Sumerian transitions, with its mention of 
praise, into the two-line conclusion formula (Maul’s Schlußformel),11 which is the 
final structural feature of an ershaḫunga-prayer.

1.    šá be-lim nu-ug!-gat ŠÀ-šú ana aš-ri-šú li-tu-ra 
 
   
Line 1: The ša indicates possession (see libbīšu). Bēlu, “lord.” Nuggat, “wrath, anger,” 
related to the verb agāgu, “to be angry” (see CAD A/1, 139–40), is in construct with ŠÀ = 
libbu, “heart.” (See the commentary on this line in Maul, 244 for the reading ug!.) The 3ms 
pronominal suffix on libbu is resumptive, referring back to ša bēlim, “that of the lord.” The 
phrase  ana  ašrīšu  litūra  literally  means  “may  it  return  to  its  place.”  Idiomatically,  the 
phrase means “to return to normal” (see CAD T, 255), which in this case means the suppli-

cant wants the anger of the deity to subside and the deity’s disposition toward the peti-
tioner to return to status quo. Litūra is the precative form of the verb târu “to return,” with 
a ventive suffix. The “anger” of a god is only mentioned in line 1 (in fact, the only time it 
is the  subject of the refrain’s  verb,  litūra). Lines 2–10  each simply identify a  deity (or a 
deity’s heart, as in lines 6–7). We should probably assume that these deities are also con-
sidered  angry  (see  the  next  note  and  the  restoration  in  lines  9–10).  As  indicated  in  the 
introduction, line 1 is distinguished from the following lines, which are all paired to incor-
porate  both  genders.  It  provides  a  summary  of  the  intent  of  the  prayer:  to  placate  the 
god(dess).  
 
   
Line 2: Ilum, “god.” Ša marks a relative clause. Lā is a negative particle used in sub-
ordinate  clauses,  questions, and  prohibitions  while  ul  is  used  in  independent  declarative 
sentences. Edû (idû), “to know.” The form is a 1cs preterite, īde, with a subjunctive = īdû. 
The petitioner begins the prayer by addressing the god and goddess that they do not know, 
indicating their ignorance of the offence committed.  Since  the petitioner does  not know 
how or whom they offended, they must “cover the bases” and make sure to include every 
possible deity. While the scribe left the second half of lines 2–7 and probably 9–10 blank, 
ana ašrīšu/ašrīša litūra is implied (see line 8). The gender (and number) of the pronominal 
suffix on ašru will vary according to the grammatical gender of the deity/item named in 
subsequent lines. 
 
   
Line  3:  Ishtar,  the  goddess  of  love  and  war,  was  a  major  deity  during  the  Neo-
Assyrian  empire  (see Tzvi  Abusch,  “Ishtar,”  DDD,  452–56 and  Black  and  Green, 108–9). 
However, in this text ištar is used generically to indicate a “goddess.” This line begins a 
typical construction seen in this prayer in which consecutive lines repeat the phrase with a 
divine subject of the opposite gender. 
 
   
Line 4: Idû lā idû is rendered “known or unknown, i.e., whatever” according to CAD 
I/J, 29b. Notice the assonance in the first half of the phrase as well as the fact that three of 
the first four words contain two syllables providing a quickly moving rhythm. 
 
   
Line 5: There is no Akkadian translation of the Sumerian line, ama-dinnin ì-zu nu-un-
zu ki-bi-šè; however, the assumed translation is easily provided since the only difference 
between lines 4 and 5 is the shift in subject: from “god” to “goddess.”

Line 6:  DINGIR = ilu, “god.” The sign IA marks the 1cs suffix and is a combination of 
the I and A signs but is commonly normalized as ya (MesZL, #260). This line recalls the 
petition in the first line; however, the pronouns have switched from third to first person 
(though, the Sumerian version contains the 3ms suffix as seen in line 1). In lines 6 and 7 
the petitioner addresses their own personal god/goddess.

Line 8: Litūrū is a 3mp precative form of târu, “to return.” Masculine plural nouns are 
used to indicate mixed gender plurals as well as strictly male plurals. This line is unique in 
that both genders are mentioned within the same line. 
 

Line 7:  As in  line 5, there is no Akkadian translation of the Sumerian line, šà-ama-

ištar ša elīya isbusu ana ašrīša litūra 

Line 10: This line is fragmentary, but presumably it is identical to the previous except 

 
Line 9: The reconstruction is based on line 32. Isbusu is a 3cs preterite from šabāsu 
(sabāsu), “to be(come) angry” (see CAD Š/1, 4b–5a); the –u suffix is the subjunctive, mark-
ing this as the  verb  of  the  clause  beginning  with  ša.  This  line  is  similar  to  the  previous 
lines; however, a verb marks the divine anger explicitly, assuming a correct reconstruction. 
 
   
for the change of subject: from “god” to “goddess.” 
 
   
Line 17: The noun, akal (akalu), “bread, food,” is in the construct state and introduces 
the  relative  clause  that  follows;  this  syntactical  unit  forms  the  object  of  the  line’s  main 
verb (akālu). Uttû is a 3cs durative verb (with a subjunctive suffix) from (w)atû, “to find, to 
be present.” Ramānīya is formed from the noun ramānu, “self,” with a 1cs suffix, yielding 
“myself.” Ul negates (see the note on line 2) ākul which is the 1cs preterite form of akālu, 
“to eat.” The petitioner tells the deity that they did not eat the food and drink “by them-
selves,” i.e., they did not neglect to invite the deity to be present and share the meal with 
them (Maul, 245). This line marks the beginning of a new strophe. The  subject changes

from a god or goddess to the petitioner themselves. In this section (lines 17–25) the sup-
plicant  highlights  their  grief  and  anxiety  over  this  situation  (17–18),  asserts  their  igno-
rance in the hopes that the deity will show them mercy (19–20), and finally, admits that 
their sins are many (21–25). 
 
   
Line 18: Mû, “water.” Mê is the construct form. Šatû, “to drink.” The construction, mê 
uttû, is similar to the first phrase of line 17, akal uttû.  Like the previous line the petitioner 
says that they invited the deity to be present and share in the meal. 
 
   
Line 19: Ikkibu, “abomination, taboo.” See the note on line 17 for a discussion of the 
construct form’s function here. CAD (I/J, 57) notes that the idiom formed with the verb 
akālu, “to eat,” must not always be translated literally; however, this usage might be an 
instance of wordplay. The two previous lines describe acts of eating and drinking while 
lines 19 and 20 depict transgression in a more abstract manner. Line 19 links lines 20 and 
21 with lines 17 and 18 and indicates that this section refers to the same event. The sup-
plicant admits guilt, which indicates a deterministic and retributive perspective regarding 
evil and suffering. The petitioner believes that they “reap what they sow.” In other words, 
since they are suffering they assume that they committed an offense of some kind. Howev-
er,  they  do  not  know  for  which sin  they are suffering.  Notice  the  assonance throughout 
this line, which heightens the emotional impact. 
 
   
Line 20: The use of anzil (construct of anzillu), “abomination, taboo, boundary” and 
ukabbis (1cs preterite of kubbusu [D of kabāsu], “to tread”) is semantically equivalent to the 
idiom in line 19. The supplicant again rephrases the same plea in order to get the god’s 
attention and to make sure that every potentially offended deity is addressed. 
 
   
Line 21: Annu (arnu), “guilt, misdeed.” Mâdu, “to be(come) much, many.” Rabû, “to 
be(come) great.” Maʾdā (see CAD M/1, 24) and rabâ are both 3fp predicatives. (Compare 
the attributive use of the feminine plural form of mādu [maʾdu] in line 58 with the predica-
tive used here.) Ḫiṭītu, “error, crime, sin”; the plural is ḫiṭâtu. This line is the first to men-
tion the quantity and severity of the petitioner’s offence. In addition to recognizing trans-
gression,  the  supplicant  confesses  the  grave  nature  of  it.  Likely,  since  the  sufferer  is  in 
extreme discomfort (see lines 32–33) they assume that their transgression was proportion-
ally offensive to the deity.

lines 24–25.

“whichever” deity. 
 
   
Line 26: Epēšu, “to do.” This form is a 1cs preterite with a subjunctive suffix. Lines 
26–29 are similar in structure: the line begins with a noun in the construct state that in-
troduces a relative clause and is then followed by a 1cs preterite verb ending with a sub-
junctive suffix (see line 17). This syntactical construction forms the object of the main verb 
(edû). Each line ends with ul īde, “I do not know.”  The petitioner lists different synonyms 
for “crime, sin, and taboo” in order to underscore the fact that they are completely igno-
rant of their offence. 
 
anni ēpušu ul īde 
   
Line 27: Ḫīṭu, “error, sin.” Compare this with the form in line 56. Ḫaṭû, “to commit an 
error, crime, sin.” Aḫṭû is a 1cs preterite with a subjunctive suffix. The second half of this 
line is supplied from the previous line according to the pattern of repeating a similar idea 
with different terminology.

Line 30:  Uggat is the construct form of uggatu, “rage, fury.” Nekelmû, “to glower, to 
frown, to regard malevolently.” The preterite form here, ikkelmânni, has a ventive and 1cs 
suffix (as do all the final verbs in lines 30–33). Lines 30–34 attribute the supplicant’s afflic-
tion  to  divine  anger.  This  section  begins  merely  stating  that  the  deity  is  angry  (30–31) 
while lines 32–34 describe the supplicant’s condition as “sick” (marṣu), “burning” (ṣarāpu), 
and “afflicted” (ašuštu), respectively. 
 
bēlum ina uggat libbīšu ikkelmânni 
   
Line 31: Uzzu, “anger.” Šumḫuru (Š of maḫāru), “to cause to confront.” The petitioner 
presents their suffering as a product of divine confrontation. This line includes yet another 
synonym for divine anger. In light of the nominative, bēlum, that begins line 30 we could 
interpret  i-lì  as  a  so-called  nominative  absolute  therefore  translating  this  line  as,  “My 
god—he  had  made  me  confront  the  anger  of  his  heart.”  However,  the  Sumerian,  dingir 
šag4 šur2-ra-bi, speaks against this interpretation. 
 

Line 29: See the note to line 20 for the phrase in the first half of this line. 
anzil ukabbisu ul īde 

ili ina uzzi libbīšu ušamḫiranni 

Line 32: Isbus-ma bears the enclitic –ma, “and,” which is used to join the line’s two 
clauses together. Marṣiš (based on marṣu, “sick”) has the terminative-adverbial ending –iš 
but is not to be confused with the adverb marṣiš, “bitterly.” Šūmû (Š of emû [ewûm]), when 
used  with  –iš,  means  “to  turn,  change  into”  (see  CAD  E,  415).  The  deity’s  anger  is  not 
merely causing external duress but is even affecting the petitioner’s health. 
 

ištar elīya isbus-ma marṣiš ušēmânni 

Line 33: The beginning of lines 33–34 were left blank by the scribe. The translation 
was  apparently  assumed.  The  assumed  Akkadian  translation  is  based  on  the  Sumerian: 
dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-zu. Ṣurrupu (D of ṣarāpu), “to burn.” Foster translates this verb idio-
matically (“excoriated me”) but ṣarāpu can also indicate physical pain such as a burning 
sensation in the intestines and/or epigastrium (CAD Ṣ, 103). This reading fits better with 
the previous line that says a goddess made the petitioner sick.

Line 34: The assumed Akkadian translation is based on the Sumerian: ama-dinnin ì-zu 
nu-un-zu. Ašuštu, “affliction, grief.” Iškuna is a 3cs preterite of šakānu with a ventive. This 
line concludes the section that attributes the supplicant’s affliction to the unknown deity. 
The  nominative  form,  ašuštu,  is  an  example  of  the  fact  that  in  Standard  Babylonian  the 
nominative case ending often occurs where we expect an accusative. 
 
    
Line 35: Aštaneʾʾê-ma is a Gtn durative of šeʾû, “to seek out,” with an enclitic –ma. As 
the supplicant is still lamenting their situation, the duratives in lines 35 and 37 should be 
understood  as  referring  to  habitual  action  in  the  past.  Mamman,  “someone,  somebody.” 
The phrase qāta ṣabātu, lit. “to seize the hand,” is an idiom meaning “to help,” but it can 
also mean “to lead” and possibly both connotations are meant here. The petitioner is alone 
and without help because no one—not even a human much less a god—would guide them 
as they searched for answers (see CAD Ṣ, 30–32). In lines 35–37 the supplicant claims that 
no one responded to their cries for help. The laments build until line 38, where the peti-
tioner concludes the lament section of the prayer by describing their present state of mis-
ery.  
 
    
Line 36: Bakû, “to cry.” Itâtēya is the plural of itû, “boundary, environs,” with a 1cs 
pronoun. Iṭḫû is a 3mp preterite of ṭeḫû, “to approach.” Not only would no one give the 
petitioner guidance but they would not even come near them. 
 
    
Line 37: Qubû, “lament.” Qabû, “to speak.” Šemû, “to hear.” This lament extends the 
idea of the previous line—no one cared about the supplicant enough to listen to their suf-
fering let alone attempt to help them. 
 
    
Line 38: Uššušu, “distress, worry.” Katmu literally means “hidden,” but in the context 
of  this  prayer  the  petitioner  likely  means  that  their  plight  is  hidden  from the  gods;  i.e., 
they are alone in their troubles with no one to help. In concert with the previous two lines, 
this phrase could indicate the fact that other humans have abandoned them as well. The   
–āku endings on the two substantives indicate the 1cs predicative. Naṭālu, “to see.”

Line 39: Rēmēnû, “merciful.” Attanasḫar is a Ntn durative of saḫāru, “to search con-
stantly.” Unnīnu, “prayer, petition.” To speak (qabû) a prayer or petition (unnīnu) to a di-
vine being is to implore them. The description of the god as “merciful” contains an implied 
request that the deity act in accordance with this characteristic. Lines 39–46 comprise a 
transition  section  between  the  lament  and  the  petition  section  in  which  the  supplicant 
turns to the deity for help. The duratives should now be translated as referring to the pre-
sent. 
 
    
Line 40: Šēpā is a dual form of šēpu, “foot.” Nuššuqu (D of našāqu), “to kiss.” The res-
toration  in  the  middle  of  the  line  is  suggested  by  the  Sumerian  mu-un-su-ub-su-ub;  see 
Maul, 239, 245 and Langdon, 42. Aptanaššil is a Gtn from pašālu, “to crawl.” The repeated 
use of š heightens the emotional thrust of this line and possibly imitates a crawling sound. 
The pronominal suffix on šēpāša is redundant with the ša at the head of the line. 
 
    
Line 41:  Nasḫuru  (N of  saḫāru),  “to return, to show favorable attention,  to repent.” 
After an initial ana, the first half of line 41 is blank (an assumed translation) and most of 
the rest of the line is broken. The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first 
half of the line: dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-[zu . . .] (see likewise lines 42 and 44–46). The sec-
ond  halves  of  lines  41–46  take  their  cue  from  Langdon’s  conjectural  restorations  (42). 
These are reasonable but quite uncertain. If the reconstruction is accurate, the supplicant 
tries to  get  the  deity’s attention with  the  use  of  direct imperatives  here  and in  the  next 
several lines in order that the deity might pay attention to the supplicant’s plight.

Line 42: Presumably, this line follows the pattern of repeating the previous plea with 
a goddess as the subject. The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation: ama-dinnin ì-zu 
[nu-un-zu . . .].

Line 43: Lines 43 and 44 address a particular deity whereas lines 41–42 and 45–46 
are addressed to “whichever god/goddess.” The  Akkadian reconstruction of this line  fol-
lows Langdon’s conjecture tentatively (42), but see Maul’s reservations, particularly con-
cerning the reading of the GUR sign (239,  246).  Even if the reading of the  GUR sign is 
valid, it is doubtful that the Akkadian analogue would be saḫāru since there is only one

Line 44: The Sumerian suggests the assumed Akkadian translation for this line: ama-
dinnin. Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to look at, to gaze at, to consider.” Naplisīnni is a 2fs N im-
perative with a 1cs suffix.

Line 45: The Sumerian suggests the assumed Akkadian translation for this line: dìm-

Line 46: Again, the Sumerian suggests the assumed Akkadian translation for this line: 

    
ama-dinnin ì-zu [nu-un-zu…]. 
 
    
Line  47:  The  phrase  adi  mati  is  composed  of  two  particles:  adi,  “until,”  and  mati, 
“when.”  The  phrase  is  typically  rendered,  “how  long  (until)?”  With  line  47  the  prayer 
begins the petition section (lines 47–55). After attempting to get the deity’s attention (lines 
41–46), the petitioner now asks a series of “how long . . .” questions (lines 47–55).  
 
    
Line 48: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line: 
me-en-na ama-dinnin-mu. The second half is partially restored conjecturally by Maul (240). 
Kabattu,  “innards,  liver,  mind,  mood,”  is  frequently  found  in  parallelism  with  libbu  (see 
line 47). Lipšaḫa is a 3cs precative of pašāḫu, “to cool down, rest, abate,” with a ventive 
suffix.  
 
    
Line 49: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line: 
me-en-na  dìm-me-er  ì-zu  nu-un-zu.  Linūḫ  is  a  3cs  precative  of  nâhu,  “to  calm  down,  to 
relent.”

Line 50: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line: 
me-en-na ama-dinnin ì-zu nu-un-zu. Ahû, “foreign, different” (to be differentiated from aḫu, 
which means, “side, arm”). In this line ahû describes the disposition of a goddess’s heart 
that is not in its normal condition, i.e., it is estranged from the petitioner. This final ques-
tion in the series recalls the beginning of the prayer with the plea that the fury of the dei-
ty’s heart subside (see line 1: nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra); however, in line 50 the peti-
tioner asks that the deity’s estranged heart might be reconciled (libbīšu aḫû ana ašrīšu litūr). 
 
    
Line  51:  Amēlūtu  (amīlūtu,  awīlūtum),  “humanity.”  Sukkuku,  “deaf,  mentally  handi-
capped,” is a 3fs predicative here. Mimma, “anything, something.” This line begins a sec-
tion  in  the  petition  (lines  51–55)  in  which  the  supplicant  reiterates  their  ignorance  in 
committing the offence. They stress the finite nature of humanity—in comparison to the 
gods, humans are deaf and unknowing. The supplicant implies that the deity should take 
the human condition into consideration and provide them mercy. 
 
    
Line 52: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation of the line’s first word: nam-
lú-u18-lu. Mal(a), “all, as many as.” Mala / ša šuma nabû, is an idiom for “everything, eve-
ryone” (see CAD N/1, 35 for other examples with amēlūtu). Mīnu, “what?” The supplicant 
has gone out of the way to describe the deity in multiple ways to include every contingen-
cy. In like manner, the supplicant says that no matter how humanity is described or what 
terms are used for them, the results are the same—humans lack knowledge. 
 
    
Line 53: Gullulu (D), “to sin, to do wrong.” Dummuqu (D of damāqu), “to do good, to 
make pleasant.” The syntagm, Lū . . . lū means, “either/whether . . . or” (CDA, 184 and 
CAD L, 226–27). Not only should humanity not be held responsible for misdeeds due to 
ignorance, similarly, good deeds are not meritorious. 
 
    
Line 54: ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.” Sakāpu, “to repulse, to turn away” (see CAD 
S, 73). Lines 54–55 present an emotionally compelling plea. The petitioner imagines them-
selves as stuck in a swamp and unable to extricate themselves—they must rely upon exter-
nal help. Therefore, the supplicant puts their well-being into the hands of the deity. For 
the aradka-style and change of person from first to third, see Maul, 19.

Line 55: Rušumtu, “swamp.” Qassu is formed from the noun qātu, “hand,” and a 3ms 
suffix.  Nadi  is a  predicative  from  nadû,  “to  throw  down,  lay  down.”  See line 35  for  the 
idiom qāssu ṣabat. 
 
    
Line 56:  Ḫiṭṭu  =  ḫīṭu,  “error,  sin.”  For  ḫaṭû,  see  line  27.  Tēr  is  an  imperative  from 
turru  (D of  târu),  which means “to turn something into something else” when used  with 
ana  (this  text  exhibits  occasional  Assyrianisms  such  as  ēpuš  and  accordingly  this  word 
could be read as ti7-ir > tīr). As mentioned in the introduction to the prayer, the last three 
lines of Akkadian (lines 56–58) and the first four of the final seven lines in Sumerian (see 
footnote 5 above) replace the typical intercessory litany often found in ershaḫunga-prayers 
with a litany for the removal of sin. The fifth line of Sumerian transitions with its mention 
of  praise  into  the  two-line  conclusion  formula  (Maul’s Schlußformel),  the  final  structural 
feature of an ershaḫunga-prayer. 
 
    
Line  57:  For  annu,  see  line  21.  Šāru,  “wind.”  We  expect  a  subjunctive  on  the  verb 
ēpuš, as in the previous line, but it is lacking. Litbal is a precative from tabālu, “to carry off, 
to take away,” a verb closely related to (w)abālu. In the last two lines the petitioner asks 
that the sins they have repeatedly acknowledged throughout this prayer be carried away in 
the wind and stripped off of their  body.  Misdeeds are not merely actions that disappear 
with time but they are pictured as objects that stick to the offender. 
 
    
ending. Ṣubātu, “textile, garment.” Kīma, “as, like.” Šaḫātu, “to strip off, to cast off.”

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS: 

 ־ל ַ

There are many constructions in the Prayer to Any God that have semantic 
or  lexical  analogues  to  BH.  The  phrase  in  line  1,  nuggat  libbīšu,  “anger  of  his 
heart,” is semantically similar to several expressions in BH; however, instead of 
using a  bound phrase, Hebrew normally uses verbs with  ב ֵל to indicate anger.1 
For  example,  Prov  19:3:  “a  man’s  folly  subverts  his  path  and  his  heart  rages 
against Yahweh (
)”; Ezek 32:9: “I will provoke the heart (י ִתּ ְס ַ ְכ ִה ְו 
ב ֵל) of many peoples when I bring (news) of your defeat among the nations”; and 
Deut 19:6: “lest the redeemer lynch the killer when his heart burns (וֹב ָב ְל ם ַחֵי).” 
There  are  also  a  few  lexical  analogues.  A  BH  analogue  to  the  word  sukkuku, 
“deaf, mentally handicapped” (line 51), appears once albeit in a verbal form in 
Deut 27:9: ל ֵא ָר ְשׂ ִי ע ַמ ְשׁוּ ת ֵכּ ְס ַה, “Silence! Listen, Israel!”2  

וֹבּ ִל ף ַ ְזִי ה ָוֹהְי

This prayer contains many sentiments that are similar to those found in bib-
lical  prayers.  For  example,  when  Job  brings  his  case  against  Yahweh  he  com-
mands, “take your hand and forearm far away from me—stop terrorizing me!” 
(13:21). Although Job is more forceful and blunt than the petitioner of our Ak-
kadian prayer, both prayers share the  view  that the  offended deity is bringing 
trouble upon the supplicants. Job also asks Yahweh, “why are you hiding your 
face from me and regarding me as your enemy?” (13:24). This question parallels 
lines  35–39  of  this  prayer  in  which  the  petitioner  says  that  they  kept  seeking 
help but no one came to their aid. However, there are differences between Job 
and Prayer to Any God. In contrast to Prayer to Any  God, Job does not admit 
guilt. In fact, Job maintains his innocence and challenges Yahweh to make his 
offenses known (13:23). 

 ָטּ ַה ְו

די ִמ ָת י ִדּ ְג ֶנ י ִתא

Psalm 51 contains a humble confession of sin that is similar to the tone of 
our prayer; however, the psalmist knows his offense (ע ָד ֵא י ִנ ֲא י ַ ָשׁ ְפ) and he is con-
tinually aware of his sin (
; v. 5), whereas our petitioner commit-
ted their offense in ignorance and they do not know what they did that offended 
the  deity  (lines  19–20).  The  psalmist  also  implores  God,  “wash  away  my  vice 
and  cleanse  me  from  my  sin”  (י ִנ ֵר ֲה ַט  י ִתא ָטּ ַח ֵמוּ  י ִנוֹ ֲ ֵמ  י ִנ ֵס ְבּ ַכּ;  v.  4),  which  parallels 
lines 57–58 of Prayer to Any God. Lastly, Psalm 40:3 recounts a time when God 
pulled the psalmist out of a pit of destruction (ןוֹא ָשׁ רוֹבּ) and the miry mud ( טי ִט
ן ֵו ָיּ ַה), which is similar to the imagery in line 55 where the supplicant is stranded 
in swamp water (mê rušumti). 

Finally,  the  anguish  seen  in  Lamentations  1:16,  20–21  parallels  that  in 
Prayer  to  Any  God.  In  Lamentations  1:20  the  lamenter  describes  his  grief  in 
terms of distress (ר ַצ), a burning belly (וּר ָמ ְר ַמ ֳח י ַ ֵמ; this is similar to the imagery 
 
1  Tawil (ALCBH, 182, §37) translates the bound phrase ז ָגּ ַר ב ֵל in Deut 28:65 as “a raging heart” 
under the gloss “furious, raging.” He links this with the Akkadian phrase libbu aggu/ezzu. How-
ever, ז ָגּ ַר merely means “agitated quivering” and the context indicates that the phrase should be 
rendered “fluttering heart,” referring to fear or anxiety instead of anger. 
2  See Chaim Cohen, Biblical Hapax Legomena in the Light of Akkadian and Ugaritic (Missoula: 
Scholars Press, 1978), 111:12.

in line 33), and a heart doing somersaults (י ִבּ ְר ִק ְבּ י ִבּ ִל  ַפּ ְה ֶנ). Both texts try to get 
the  deity’s  attention  by  underscoring  the  petitioner’s  contrition.  Furthermore, 
the lamenter echoes the cry of Prayer to Any God in lines 35–38 in that no one 
is present to give comfort (Lam 1:16, 21).

A Tamitu to Shamash and Adad 

ALAN LENZI 

SHAMASH AND ADAD:  

 

See pages 197 and 85. 

THE PRAYER:  

 
Tamitu-prayers are essentially long yes-or-no questions posed to the gods of 
extispicy,  Shamash  and  Adad.  The  answer  was  received  via  extispicy.  As  de-
scribed in the general introduction, after the invariable invocation and epithets 
(see our line 1), tamitus are quite varied in their content but show a number of 
common  structural  features,  all  or  several  of  which  may  appear  in  any  given 
tamitu-prayer. Our prayer includes a formal presentation of the person for whom 
the diviner is making the inquiry (lines 3–5a)—a guard responsible for a particu-
lar section of the city’s fields; an attempt to persuade the deities to respond via 
flattery  (line  5b);  a  stipulated  term  during  which  the  inquiry  was  applicable 
(lines 6–7); the question (lines 8–21), about which we will say more below; and 
one  technical  qualification  in  the  form  of  an  ezib-clause  (line  22).  The  prayer 
does  not  include  one  of  the  endings  identified  in  Lambert’s  structural  outline 
(14).  
 
The question comprises the majority of the text. It may be divided into three 
parts, the  last  two of which are marked  by  a re-introduction of the person  for 
whom the diviner is inquiring (see lines 13 and 20). The first part (lines 8–12) 
describes the potential preparations and  attack of an enemy army. The second 
(lines 13–18) describes what the enemy may potentially harm among that which 
the  concerned  person  is  guarding.  And  the  third  part  (lines  19–21)  describes 
how the person for whom the diviner is inquiring might be affected by the ene-
my’s potential actions. 
The  main  MS  used  in  Lambert’s  edition  of  this  prayer,  ND  5492  (=  IM 
 
67692), was a compendium tablet that contained six tamitus. Its colophon indi-
cates that this tablet was Tablet VII of the Nimrud series of tamitus. Its copyist 
was an exorcist, not a diviner, as one might expect.

Line 1: The diviner opens with an invocation to the gods of extispicy. dUTU = Šamaš, 
the sun god, god of justice. EN = bēlu, “lord.” Dīnu, “decision, judgment.” dIŠKUR = Adad, a 
storm god. For Adad’s role in divination, see page 86. Bīru, “divination” (both the act of 
extispicy and the answer received). The epithets bēl dīnim and bēl bīri are typical for Sha-
mash  and  Adad  when  they  are  invoked  for  divinatory  purposes.  See  the  OB  ikribu-like 
prayer on page 85 and the ikribu-prayers generally (see Zimmern, BBR, nos. 75–101 [pp. 
190–219]).  
 
   
Line 2: Ša, a relative pronoun (“who, which”), refers to both Shamash and Adad as 
the object of the first verb, thus “whom.” Šâlu, “to ask.” The verb is a 1cs durative with a 
2mp dative pronominal suffix. The pronominal suffix is resumptive. As the verb indicates, 
the body of the text should be understood in an interrogatory mode. Annu, “consent, ap-
proval, ‘yes’.” Kīnu, “firm, reliable, true.” These last two words belong with the following 
imperative; they describe the kind of answer the diviner is requesting the gods give him. 
 

Šamaš bēl dīnim Adad bēl bīri 

ša ašallūkunūši anna kīna 

   
Line  3:  Apālu,  “to  answer,  to  reply.”  The  verb  is  a  cp  impv.  with  a  1cs  accusative 
pronominal suffix. The phrase in lines 2–3b is only attested here on the Nimrud  MS that 
preserves  this tamitu.  The  other five tamitus in  this  Nimrud  compendium  move  directly 
into the identification of the person for whom the diviner is inquiring or into the stipulat-
ed term.  SÍG can be read as both šīpātu, “wool,” or šārtu, “hair.”  TÚG.SÍG = sissiktu, “hem, 
fringe.” Lambert argues that the phrase SÍG u TÚG.SÍG may have originally been understood 
as “hair and fringe,” offering OB and MB parallels for support; but such an understanding, 
he  notes,  leaves the  ms  annû,  “this,”  unexplained since  we  expect  a  fs,  annītu.  Thus,  he 
suggests that although the phrase originally meant “hair and fringe” it was misunderstood 
in the MB period, when scribes read the first SÍG as šipātu, “wool,” and took the phrase as a 
hendiadys: “wool and  fringe” = “woolen  fringe” (see  Lambert, 15–17). In  any case,  the 
item(s) referred to by the phrase is to be understood conceptually as a metonymic substi-

tute  for  its  owner.  Lines  3–5  introduce  this  owner,  for  whom  the  diviner  is  making  the 
divinatory inquiry, as one on guard duty in the fields, which were outside the city walls. 
 
   
Line 4: TA = ištu, “from.” A.ŠÀ = eqlu, “field.” NENNI = annanna, “so-and-so.” Usually 
used as a placeholder for the supplicant’s name, in this case annanna stands for the par-
ticular field being guarded by the person introduced in line 3. EN = adi, “until, as far as.”   
 
   
Line  5:  EN.NUN  =  maṣṣartu,  “watch.”  Naṣāru,  “to  guard,  to  watch,  to  protect.”  The 
verb is 3cs durative. The –u on the end is the subjunctive (due to the ša in line 4). The verb 
and  its  object  require  an  idiomatic  rather  than  literal  translation.  DINGIR-ut-ku-nu  = 
ilūtkunu, “your divinity.” GAL-tum = rabītum (fs), “great.” In a parenthetical expression in 
the second half of this line and the first word of the next the diviner flatters the gods’ su-
perior knowledge. 
 
   
Line 6: ZU = edû (idû), “to know.” The form īdû, although formally preterite, has no 
tense. One must provide it from context. Ūmu, “day.” NE = annû, “this.” Idiomatically, ūme 
annî means “today.” The day of the actual inquiry marks the start of the inquiry’s stipulat-
ed term (often called adannu in Akk., see line 22), that is, the time period during which 
the  divinatory  action  is  applicable.  The  duration  is  indicated  in  the  next  line.  DÙ-ti  = 
nēpeštu, “activity, procedure, ritual performance.” Bārûtu, “divination.” The diviner speci-
fies how he will discover the answer to his inquiry. 
 
   
Line 7: UD.30.KÁM = the 30th day of the month.  ITI = arḫu (warḫum), “month.” The 
stipulated term is less than a month (see also line 22). UD.NÁ.A = bibbulu (bubbulu), “the 
day of the disappearance of the moon.” A lunar month is usually 28 or 29 days. The day of 
the moon’s disappearance would mark the end of the previous month and the beginning of 
the next.  
 
   
Line 8: ÉRIN = ummānu, “army, troops.” KÚR = nakru, “foreign, strange; enemy” In its 
substantival usage, as here, nakru refers to enemies. Mala, “as many as, as much as.” Bašû, 
“to be, to exist.” The form is predicative. Mala bašû means “as many as there are.” Qallu 
(m), qallatu (f), “small, light.” As applied to an army, perhaps “light forces” (see CAD Q, 
62). This line introduces the concern about which the diviner is inquiring for the person 
introduced in lines 3–5. Ummān nakri is the subject of the verbs that follow in lines 9–20.

Some of the verbs are 3cs and others are 3mp. Lines 8–12 describe the potential prepara-
tions and attack of the enemy.

Line 9: Kabittu, “main body, main forces of the army.” Lā, “not.” The following four 
verbs  describe  the  preparations  an  enemy  army  might  make  before  an  attack,  which  is 
finally  mentioned  in  line  12.  The  verb  uštagappašū  and  the  two  morphologically  similar 
verbs in line 10 are difficult. Although probably to be derived from the Št stem, none of 
these verbs is attested in this stem outside of the present text. Tentatively, šutagappušu (Št 
of gapāšu) is understood here to mean “to cause oneself to be enlarged, swelled”(?). The 
form  is  a  3mp  durative,  utilizing  the  long  form  of  the  durative  typical  of  the  Št  lexical 
(likewise with the verbs in line 10).  
 
   
Line 10: Šutapaḫḫuru (Št of paḫāru), “to cause oneself to be gathered in force”(?) (al-
ternatively, see CAD P, 32, whose analysis leaves the infixed –ta– unexplained). Šutadan-
nunu (Št of danānu), “to cause oneself to be strengthened”(?). 
 
   
Line 11: Rēṣu, “helper, ally” (see CAD R, 268–70). Tillatu, “reinforcement, support.” 
TUKU = rašû, “to acquire, to gain.” Notice that the verb here and the one in the next line 
are 3cs. 
 
   
Line 12: Tību, “attack.” Šiḫṭu (šeḫṭu), “attack, raid.” Šakānu, “to put, to place,” but in 
this context a more idiomatic rendering is required: “to make,” “to inflict,” etc. Notice the 
ventive marker on the verb, indicating the action lies in the direction of the speaker.  
 
   
Line 13: Ina usually means “in,” but “during” is contextually more appropriate. For 
EN.NUN = maṣṣartu, see line 5. For the remainder of the line, see line 3. This line breaks 
the rhythm of the previous few and begins a section (lines 13–18) that describes the possi-
ble results of the enemy’s attack. Notice that the person for whom the diviner is inquiring 
is mentioned again here at a structural turning point in the inquiry.

Line 14: EDIN = ṣēru, “steppe, hinterland.” MÁŠ.ANŠE = būlu, “animals, livestock.” URU 
= ālu, “city.” Šallatu, “booty.” The diviner inquires whether the enemy will inflict losses 
(see lines 16–18 for the verbs) inside and outside of the city, that is, anywhere, so as to 
affect the herds and the possessions of the person for whom the diviner is inquiring. Šallatu 
is not limited to moveable property; it includes human captives or prisoners, too. This line 
stands in parallel with line 15. Thus, the two specific nouns here stand in parallel to the 
two that indicate generic quantity in line 15. All four nouns in the acc. case in lines 14–15, 
būla, šallata, mīṣa, maʾda, comprise the grammatical objects of the verbs used in lines 16–
18. 
 
   
Line  15:  The  ina  has  the  sense  of  “with  respect  to”  here.  Mīṣu  (wīṣum,  īṣu),  “little, 
few.”  Maʾdu  (mādu),  “much,  many,  abundant,  numerous.”  The  phrase  ina  mīṣi  mīṣa  ina 
maʾdi maʾda (see the first word of the next line) specifies how much the enemy may take, 
which depends on how much there is available for the taking. Lambert translates it, “little 
where there is little, much where there is much” (33).  
 
   
Line 16: The first word here belongs with the previous line. Lines 16–18 contain the 
following syntagm: relative pronoun ša + inf. + durative verb, where the inf. and dura-
tive verb are from the same root. The ša plus inf. defines that which is potentially available 
among the objects of the verbs to suffer from the action of the verbs, thus “they will not 
kill livestock . . . booty . . . a little . . . a lot, which can be killed, will they?” This is the 
meaning of Lambert’s “as appropriate” (33).

Line  19:  This  line  begins  the  last  section  of  the inquiry;  it  centers  on  the  potential 
aftermath of the enemy’s raid. Bussurtu, “news, report, tidings,” does not necessarily desig-
nate good news, though that is its most common use. It is often bound to other nouns, such

as ḫadû, “joy,” dumqu, “favor,” or lumnu, “evil,” to specify its meaning (see CAD B, 346–47 
for attestations). The noun is fem. pl. here. MUNUS. ḪUL = lemuttu, “evil, wickedness.” 
 
   
Line 20: The person for whom the diviner is inquiring appears yet again at this struc-
tural junction, the  start of the last section of the inquiry, as one who  might receive bad 
news resulting from the enemy’s violent actions. Ana, “to, for.” Bussuru (pussuru), “to de-
liver,  to  send,  to  receive  news.”  Although  often  used  for  good  news,  the  verb  does  not 
necessarily have this connotation (see CAD B, 347–48). 
 
   
Line 21: Libbu, “heart.” GIG = marāṣu, “to be(come) sick.” Lemēnu, “to be(come) bad, 
to fall into bad times.” Both verbs, however, when used with libbu as subject can mean “to 
be(come) angry, displeased” (see CAD M, 274 and L, 117). Lambert therefore renders the 
verbs as “be distressed or distraught.” Since libbu must be the subject of the verbs, the final 
u on both are superfluous, perhaps added by dint of the fact that the verbs in lines 16–18, 
20 end with the 3mp –ū. The query concludes with the potential reaction of the person for 
whom the query is being made. There is no praise offered or promised to the deities in-
voked. 
 
   
Line  22:  The  only  ezib-clause  reinforces  the  stipulated  term,  adannu  (adānu),  “time 
limit, fixed time, deadline” (see lines 6–7). Ezib is a ms impv. from ezēbu; the impv. means 
“leave aside, ignore, disregard.” Ana  arkat (warkat; =  EGIR), “after.” Ēribu,  “entering, in-
coming,” refers here to the coming month, the one after the stipulated term during which 
the inquiry was applicable. Presumably the person for whom the diviner was inquiring was 
on guard duty for one month and only interested in that period of time. 
 
   
“inquiry, oracle-inquiry” (see page 49). SILIM = šulmu, “well-being, peace, safety.” 
 

Line 23: This line is the rubric to the text. It is not part of the diviner’s prayer. Tamītu,

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
The suggestions offered in the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night (see page 
79)  supply  a  broad  comparative  view  on  the  issue  of  extispicy  and  divination 
and  are  relevant  to  developing  a  comparative  perspective  on  this  prayer,  too. 
The suggestions made here will focus on two particular issues: the use of binary 
oracles and the BH equivalent of the term bussurtu. 

 

 

ӎӎӘ A TAMITU TO SHAMASH AND ADAD 

471

Although  the present prayer  involved  extispicy  to  discover  the  will  of  the 
gods,  the  format  of  the  entire  operation  was  essentially  binary:  the  gods  an-
swered a query by selecting one or the other possible reply, positive or negative. 
Biblical  narratives  occasionally  exhibit  a  binary  oracular  method  in  use.1  For 
example, in 1 Sam 14:9–14 Jonathan and his armor bearer contrive an either-or 
situation  to  determine  how  they  should  engage  an  enemy  they  have  encoun-
tered. If the enemy answers one way, the two men will stay where they are; if 
the other, they will take it as a sign that Yahweh has given them victory and will 
go up to fight the enemy. A similar oracle is invented by Gideon in Judg 6:37–40 
with the use of a fleece. These are ad hoc oracles used by individuals.  

The  best  biblical  parallel  to  the  institutional  system  used  in  the  tamitu-
prayers is the official oracular means of the Levitical high priest (Deut 33:8), the 
biblical  Urim and Thummim,  which was kept in the high priest’s ephod (Exod 
28:30;  Lev  8:8)  and  used  to  give  guidance  to  the  leader  of  the  people  (Num 
27:21).  Its  binary  format  is  suggested  by  the  manner  in  which  people  framed 
questions when inquiring of Yahweh in narrative contexts that suggest the Urim 
and  Thummim’s  use.  See,  for  example,  1  Sam  23:9–12  and  30:8.  Perhaps  the 
best  evidence for  how the  Urim  and  Thummim worked  comes  from  the  Greek 
rendering of 1 Sam 14:41, a context in which the MT has become garbled:  εἰ  ἐν 
ἐµοὶ ἤ ἐν Ιωναθαν τῷ υἱῷ µου ἡ ἀδικία, κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ, δὸς δήλους · καὶ ἐὰν τάδε εἴπῃς 
Ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου Ισραηλ, δὸς δὴ ὁσιότητα, “if the wrongdoing is in me or in Jonathan, 
my son, O Yahweh, god of Israel, give Urim (lit., clear), but if you say, ‘(it is) in 
your people Israel,’ give then Thummim (lit., holiness2).’” Although not a yes-no 
question, the framing of the question here suggests a binary opposition between 
which the Urim and Thummim would be used to decide.3 If we take the immedi-
ate context of this particular inquiry into consideration, it seems that the oracle 
could sometimes be inconclusive (1 Sam 14:37; see also 1 Sam 28:6). The same 
held true with Mesopotamian extispicy, which explains why we see the diviners 
petition Shamash  and Adad to give a sure reply (kittam šuknam) in  the ikribu- 
and associated prayers.  
 
The Akk. term bussurtu,  “news, report, tidings,” in line 19 is derived from 
the same root as the verb bussuru (pussuru) in line 20. The BH cognates to these 
are ה ָרֹשׂ ְבּ and רשׂבּ, the latter of which, like the Akk. verb, is found only in the D 
or piel stem (see Tawil, ALCBH, 61–62). The BH terms are quite similar in mean-
ing to the Akk. words. Both BH words can be used to describe goods news with 
or without further modification (see HALOT, 163–64). Compare, for example, 2 
Sam  18:19,  where  the  context  of  the  verse  provides  the  clue  that  the  news  is 
 
1  I leave aside the practice of casting lots, which may or may not have been binary in nature. 
See  Anne  Marie  Kitz,  “The  Hebrew  Terminology  of  Lot  Casting  and  Its  Ancient  Near  Eastern 
Context,”  CBQ  62  (2000),  207–14  for  a  recent  summary  of  what  we  know  about  the  practice 
(reference courtesy of Jeffrey Cooley). 
2  The translator has probably read םי ִמ ָתּ rather than םי ִמּ ֻתּ here.

considered good (
, “let me run so I 
can report to [ה ָר ְשּׂ ַב ֲא] the king that Yahweh has delivered him from the hand of 
his enemies”),4 with v. 27, where David explicitly assumes the news is good on 
the  basis  of  the messenger  (
,  “the  king 
said, ‘he is a good man, he will bring good news’”).5

אוֹבָי  ה ָבוֹט

Since good news is not inherent in the meaning of the words, one will also 
find attestations of these words for the delivery of bad news (determined from 
context). For example, upon hearing the news of Israel’s defeat, the capture of 
the ark, and the death of his sons from a messenger (ר ֵשּׂ ַב ְמ, lit. “one who bears 
news”)  in  1  Sam  4:17–18,  Eli  falls  backwards,  breaks  his  neck,  and  dies!6  Jer 
20:15 exemplifies well how the speaker’s attitude toward that which was report-
ed  shaped  its  reception  as  good  or  bad  news.  Jeremiah  curses  the  man  who 
brought news (ר ַשּׂ ִבּ) of Jeremiah’s birth to his father (Jer 20:15). What was in-
tended to be good news to the father is presented in an entirely negative light by 
the despairing Jeremiah. Likewise holds for the news of the death of Saul. Da-
vid’s  response  to  the  news  was  anger—even  killing  the  messenger  of  the  sup-
posed good tidings(!)—and lamentation (2 Sam 1:1–16, read with 2 Sam 4:10), 
whereas the Philistines cut off Saul’s head and sent it with his armor throughout 
the land to herald the news of his defeat (1 Sam 31:9 „ 1 Chron 10:9; compare 
this to  David’s poetic lament in  2  Sam  1:20).  This last  act  finds  an  interesting 
parallel in a Neo-Assyrian caption-inscription found on a relief. After the defeat 
of  the  Elamite  king  Teumann,  the  officers  in  the  field  sent  the  Elamite  king’s 
head  to  Ashurbanipal  to  inform  him  of  the  good  news  (ana  bussurat  ḫadê).7
 
4  See also vv. 31–32. But note v. 20, where Joab seems to believe the news will not be welcomed 
by its intended audience (David) and tries to keep the messenger from going. For other contexts 
that use our words without בוֹט to describe good news (determined from context) or to announce 
something positive, see, e.g., 2 Kgs 7:9, Isa 40:9, 60:6, 61:1, Nah 2:1 (compare with Isa 52:7), 
Pss 40:10, 68:12–14, and 96:2 („ 1 Chron 16:23). 
5  See similarly 1 Kgs 1:42. 
6  See David’s reaction to the news of Absalom’s death in 2 Sam 18:32–19:1. Although not attest-
ing the words under discussion, Gen 37:31–35 and Job 1:13–21 also illustrate the severe impact 
of unexpected bad news upon its hearers.

A NB Royal Prayer to Nabu 

ALAN LENZI 

 

NABU:  

See page 325. 

THE PRAYER:  

 
Neo-Babylonian  royal  inscriptions  typically  conclude  with  a  prayer,  some-
times also called a blessing (Segenswunsch). The deity to whom the prayer is di-
rected is always chosen on the basis of the building project being commemorat-
ed in the inscription. In the present text Nabu is invoked by Nebuchadnezzar II 
because the royal inscription commemorates his restoration of É-ur5-(me)-imin-
an-ki, “the house that gathers the seven (me’s) of heaven and earth,” the ziggu-
rat of Nabu’s E-zida temple in Borsippa.1  
 
The prayer is quite simple in structure. The first two lines contain an invo-
cation and four epithets. The remainder of the prayer consists of a series of peti-
tions (lines 3–16). Although several of the epithets in the opening two lines are 
common, they seem to correspond rather closely with the petitions in the second 
part of the prayer. The first and last of the four epithets, aplu kīnim, “true heir,” 
and narām Marduk, “beloved of Marduk,” foreshadow Nebuchadnezzar’s petition 
for Nabu to intercede with Marduk on his behalf (see lines 11–12). The second, 
sukkallam ṣīri, “exalted vizier,” hints at Nabu’s role as divine scribe in the assem-
bly of the gods, mentioned in lines 8–10, and establishes him as one with official 
access  to  commend  the  supplicant  to  Marduk  (lines  13–16).  The  third  epithet, 
šitluṭu,  “triumphant,  pre-eminent  one,”  has  martial  overtones  and  connects  to 
Nebuchadnezzar’s request for dominance over his enemies in lines 6–7. 

Lines 3–16 contain four petitions. The first petition, in lines 3–7, is the most 
extensive. Based on his pious deeds (epšētūya, line 3), Nebuchadnezzar asks for 
long life, a stable reign, and the defeat of his enemies as a gift (line 7). Lines 8–
10 repeat the request for long life but this time Nabu is asked to decree and in-

zations 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993), #1193.

scribe it on his true writing board (line 8). In a culture that knows well the pres-
tige and permanence of the written word, this request is more than a repetition 
of the first petition. Nebuchadnezzar seems to be asking Nabu, the scribal god, 
to put this particular gift “in writing,” that is, to make his long life official in the 
heavenly accounts. In lines  11–13 Nebuchadnezzar asks Nabu  to commend  his 
good deeds (epšētūya, which harks back to line 3) and decree his well-being be-
fore Marduk. As the high god’s son, Nabu would have had special access to the 
figure  head  of  the  pantheon  and  would  therefore  have  been  a  very  powerful 
intercessor. Lines 14–16, the final petition, provide the actual content, the spe-
cific  words,  Nabu  is to  speak  while  in  Marduk’s presence:  “Nebuchadnezzar  is 
indeed the king, the provider!”  
 
Alongside the obvious theme of long life, one will note the predominance of 
the written and spoken word throughout the prayer. As a king, Nebuchadnezzar 
would have known very well the power of his own decree over his subjects and 
the permanence of that which he put into  writing. It seems  this prayer is con-
structed on analogy to the king’s own power:  it is hoped that  a divine written 
record  and  oral  testimony  would  insure  the  fulfillment  of  the  petitions.

I have adjusted these in consultation with the published copy of Langdon’s MS A, Norris I R 51,

Line 1:  dNa-bi-um is an archaizing spelling for Nabû. After the invocation, the intro-
duction to the prayer consists of a string of epithets that hymn Nabu. IBILA = aplu, “son, 
heir.” Kīnu, “true.” Here, the word denotes legitimacy, as in the “true heir.” Sukkallu (šuk-
kallu), “vizier, court official, minister.” Langdon’s edition omits the AL sign (see Norris I R 
51, no. 1 ii 16). Ṣīru, “exalted, supreme, outstanding.” Case endings in NB Akkadian had 
fallen out of use. The  case  endings as they appear in the text are  basically irrelevant  to 
grammatical analysis.  
 
   
Line 2: Šitluṭu,  “triumphant, pre-eminent,” is an epithet used only for Nabu and Ni-
nurta (see CAD Š/3, 130). For the martial tone of the epithet, see the related verb, the Gt

father of Nabu and high god of the Babylonian pantheon (see page 325).  
 
   
Line 3: Epištu, “work.” Epšētūya is the direct object of the verb in the next line. Ana, 
“to, for.” Damiqtu, “favor, goodwill.” Ana damiqti as a prepositional phrase works adverbi-
ally,  expressing  the  manner  in  which  the  supplicant  wishes  the  god  to  look  (see  line  4) 
upon his works. “Favorably” is a good English equivalent. Ḫadîš, “joyfully, happily.” Nebu-
chadnezzar bases his first petition (lines 3–7) on his good deeds. 
 
   
 
   
Line  5:  Balāṭu,  “life.”  Da-rí-a  is  a  pseudologogram  for  dārû,  “eternal,  lasting”  (see 
Hanspeter Schaudig, Die Inschriften Nabonids von Babylon und Kyros’ des Großen samt den in 
ihrem  Umfeld  enstandenen  Tendenzschriften:  Textausgabe  und  Grammatik  [AOAT 256; Mün-
ster: Ugarit-Verlag, 2001], 103). Šebû, “to be full, to be replete, to be satisfied with.” The 
inf. is in construct with the following noun (see the same syntagm in line 6). Littūtu, “ex-
treme old age.” Lines 5, 6, and half of 7 contain the direct object of the verb in line 7. 
 
   
Line 6: Kūnu, “firmness.” GIŠ.GU.ZA = kussû, “throne, chair.” Labāru, “to be(come) old, 
long-lasting.” Palû, “reign.” Labār palê means “long-lasting reign.” Šumqutu (Š of maqātu), 
“to cause to fall, to cause someone’s downfall or ruin.” Nakru, nakiru means “strange, for-
eign,” but as a substantive, “enemy, foe.” 
 
   
Line 7: Kašādu, “to reach, to arrive, to accomplish, to conquer.” MA.DA = mātu, “land, 
country.”  MA.DA,  rather  than  KUR,  is  used  frequently  in  NB  royal  inscriptions  for  mātu. 
Ayyābu, “enemy.” Širiktu (šeriktu), “gift, present.” Šarāku, “to give, to bestow.” The impera-
tive bears a 1cs dative suffix, showing who is to be given the gift (namely, the supplicant, 
Nebuchadnezzar).

Line  8:  Ina,  “on,  in.”  GIŠ.LI.U5.UM  =  lēʾu,  “writing  board.” Writing  boards  were  flat 
boards  made  of  wood,  ivory,  lapis  lazuli,  gold,  or  silver  which  were  covered  with  wax. 
(Only  the  first  two  materials are  attested  among  discovered artifacts.)  The  scribe  would 
inscribe a text  into  the  wax,  which  could  then  be  erased  by  heating.  For  the  discovery, 
restoration (including Agatha Christie’s role), and description of the 32 examples found at 
Nimrud,  see  Joan and  David  Oates,  Nimrud:  An  Assyrian  Imperial  City  Revealed  (London: 
British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2001), 97–99, 104 (fig. 62), and 219–20. Kunnu, “to 
establish firmly, to define, to fix.” The participle modifies lēʾu. It is bound to the following 
noun, pulukku, “boundary, limits.” As a scribal god, Nabu holds a writing board that has 
power over the cosmos as well as individuals’ fates (see line 10). 
 

ina lēʾīka mukīn puluk  

Line  9:  Šamû,  “heavens.”  U,  “and.”  Erṣetu,  “earth.”  In  this  common  word  pair,  the 

 
“earth” refers to the netherworld, forming a cosmic merism. 

šamê u erṣetim 

ibi arāku ūmīya šuṭur littūtim 

maḫar Marduk šarri šamê u erṣetim 

Line 11: (Ina) maḫar, “before, in the presence of, in front of someone.” LUGAL = šarru, 

   
Line  10:  Nabû,  “to  name,  to  decree.”  Arāku,  “to  be  long,  to  last  long.”  UD  =  ūmu, 
“day.” Šaṭāru,  “to  write,  to  inscribe.”  Lines  8–10  comprise  the  second  petition.  The  two 
imperatives  with  their  objects  are  parallel,  describing  sequential  action  Nebuchadnezzar 
wants the god to do on his behalf: he wants the god to pronounce long life and then in-
scribe that decree on his tablet. 
 
   
“king.”  
 
   
Line 12: Abu, “father.” Alādu, “to give birth to” (female subject), “to engender” (male 
subject). Note that epšētūya harks back to line 3, where “my good deeds” formed the basis 
of the first petition. Now in the third petition (lines 11–13) Nebuchadnezzar requests Nabu 
to commend his good deeds to Marduk. Šumguru (Š of magāru), “to cause to be acceptable, 
agreeable, to induce a deity to accept a  prayer, pious deed” (on  the latter meaning,  see 
CAD M/1, 42). The final vowel on the imperative, which we expect to be šumgir, is super-
fluous. 
 
   
Line 13: Qabû, “to say, to speak, to command.” Dumqu, “favor, goodness.” Idiomati-
cally, dumqī (pl) qabû means “to decree one’s well-being” (see CDA, 62). Nebuchadnezzar 
requests Nabu to give him general well-being. The two imperatives are again sequential: 
 

abi ālidīka epšētūya šumgir(i)

he  wants  the  god  to  commend  Nebuchadnezzar’s  good  deeds  and  then  decree  his  well-
being. Note the grammatical parallelism between the second and third petitions: a preposi-
tional  phrase  begins  each  (lines  8a,  11a);  an  epithet  or  two  describing  the  item/person 
identified  in  the  prepositional  phrase  follows  (lines  8b–9,  11b–12a,  both  including  the 
words šamê u erṣetim); then each conclude with two imperatives and their object (lines 10, 
12b–13). 
 
   
Line 14: The last three lines of the prayer form its final petition. Lines 14–15 contain 
the direct speech that the supplicant, in line 16, wishes to be placed in the mouth of the 
god.  dNabû-kudurri-uṣur,  “Nebuchadnezzar,”  means  “O  Nabu,  protect  the  eldest  son!” 
Kudurru in the sense of “eldest son” is almost exclusively used in proper names. See CDA, 
165 (kudurru III) and CAD K, 497 (kudurru C). 
 
   
Line 15: Lū is a particle expressing a wish, “may it be, let it be,” or affirmation, “in-
deed, verily.” It is  related to the precative. One’s translation will be  determined by how 
one understands the purpose of the deity’s direct speech (expressing the deity’s wish or the 
deity’s asseveration) within the final petition of the prayer (line 16). Zāninānu, “provision-
er, provider” (only attested here), is related to the more common zāninu. See CAD Z, 45–
46. Note the lack of a case ending on the noun. Nebuchadnezzar’s role as king is directly 
related to his ability to provide for his subjects. 
 
   
Line 16: Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed.” In keeping with the characteristics of 
a petition, the verb is a precative. Pû, “mouth.” Nebuchadnezzar expresses the desire that 
Nabu would utter the words in lines 14–15, apparently before Marduk. 
 

Nabium-kudurri-uṣur

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
Nebuchadnezzar’s first petition is a series of requests: for a long life, a stable 
throne,  an  enduring  reign,  and  the  conquest  of  his  enemies.  These  desires  are 
quite typical of ancient Near Eastern kings, including those in Israel and Judah 
as depicted in the Hebrew Bible. An interesting example from the Bible is Solo-
mon in 1 Kgs 3. When given the opportunity to ask Yahweh for anything (v. 5), 
Solomon  chose  wisdom  to  govern  his  people  (vv.  7–9)  rather  than  long  life, 

 

480

great wealth, or security from enemies.1 His choice so pleased Yahweh that the 
deity  decided  to  grant  Solomon  all  of the  other  things  that  he  did  not request 
(see vv. 12–14). These additional gifts look very similar to what Nebuchadnezzar 
requests  in  our  prayer.  Solomon’s  choice  may  look  somewhat  distinctive  upon 
first glance, but it should be kept in mind that wisdom was often characterized 
as a gift of the gods in descriptions of ancient Near Eastern kings.  

The idea of a heavenly ledger, sometimes referred to as the tablet of destiny 
and in line 8 of our prayer as “the true writing board, which establishes heaven 
and netherworld,” is found throughout Mesopotamian literature and corresponds 
to the Hebrew Bible’s heavenly scroll (ר ֶפ ֵס). Shalom Paul has listed a great many 
relevant  texts  from  Mesopotamian  literature  as  well  as  fourteen  that  name  or 
allude  to  the  heavenly  scroll  in  the  Hebrew  Bible  (Exod  32:32–33,  Isa  4:3, 
34:16–17,  65:6,  Jer  17:13,  22:30,  Mal  3:16,  Ps  40:8,  56:9,  87:6,  139:16,  Dan 
7:10, 10:21, and 12:1).2 Despite the common mythological notion of a heavenly 
ledger, the Hebrew Bible differs, as we would expect in light of its monotheistic 
editing, in that there is no separate scribal god that serves Yahweh’s court. Ei-
ther Yahweh writes in this book himself (see, e.g., Exod 32:32–33) or some other 
divine  being  must  do  it,  though  one  is  never  actually  named  (see,  e.g.,  Mal 
3:16). 
 
1  One might compare this request and its purpose to the characterization of Hammurabi in the 
prologue and epilogue of his Code. See Martha Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia 
Minor (2d ed.; SBLWAW 6; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997), 76–81, 133–40.

A Hymn to Marduk: Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 1–40 

ALAN LENZI 

MARDUK:  

See page 291. 

THE HYMN:  

The  present  hymn  forms  the  introduction  to  a  sophisticated  literary  poem 
called Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, “I will praise the Lord of wisdom.” The lord in the title 
is of course Marduk. The poem was written in four parts (“tablets”) of one hun-
dred-twenty lines each and comes down to us today on over four dozen tablets 
and fragments in various conditions of preservation.  

The  opening  hymn  in  Ludlul  I  1–40  expatiates  upon  Marduk’s  anger  and 
mercy. These contrasting  attributes are praised thematically  but the hymn also 
sets up a serial relationship between the two, especially clear in lines  2 and  4: 
Marduk’s wrath is followed by his mercy. We may read this expatiation as evi-
dence  of  divine  caprice  or  a  god’s  twisted  malevolence,  but  Shubshi-meshre-
Shakkan,  the  sufferer  who  speaks  in  the  first  person  here  (and  speaks  for  the 
poem’s anonymous author, we presume), apparently did not. Rather, the open-
ing  hymn  reflects  this man’s  personal  experience  of  Marduk,  which  the  rest  of 
the  poem  retrospectively  recounts.  The  god  who  became  angry  with  him—
precisely why remains unclear—inflicted suffering upon him both socially  (Tab-
let  I)  and  physically  (Tablet  II)  and  then  subsequently  healed  his  body  (Tablet 
III) and restored him to his previous social standing (Tablet IV). The poem ends 
as it began: with praise for Marduk (see IV 120). Despite our modern objections, 
therefore,  Marduk,  according  to  Ludlul,  is  not  the  divine  equivalent  of  the  cat 
that toys with its mouse before devouring it. Rather, he is a deity that ultimately 
shows  mercy  to  frail  and  imperfect  humans  who  have  angered  him.  Shubshi-
meshre-Shakkan  has  experienced  this  mercy  and  is  intent  upon  telling  others 
what Marduk has done for him (see line 39). 
 
The hymn, like Ludlul as a whole, employs rare  words, complex  grammar, 
and  a  sophisticated  poetic  style.  Antithetical  couplets  dominate  the  hymn,  a

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

handful  of  which  comprise  two  four  line  strophes  (see  lines  9–12  and  29–32) 
that recall Sumerian hymnic style.1 But the hymn is also punctuated by lines that 
do  not  conform to this  dominant  style.  For  example, lines 2,  4,  33,  and  34  all 
attest a semantic antithesis within their lines and lines 19–20 form a couplet with 
synonymous parallelism (see also lines 39–40, possibly).  

The  hymn’s  structure  may  be  analyzed  in  various  ways.  For  example,  one 
might see the placement of Marduk’s name as a structuring principle. It appears 
in lines 3, 11, and 31, each of which is the third line of a four-line strophe (1–4, 
9–12, and 29–32).  But it  is not clear  how this informs our  reading of  the text, 
since the segments thus delineated do not evince a clear thematic coherence or 
progression.  

Albertz has proposed a detailed structure in which a double frame (lines 1–
4, 29–36, 37–40) announces the theme of the hymn while the hymn’s core (lines 
5–28) develops it. Lines 1 and 37–40 correspond in their use of the first person 
voice and form the first, hortatory frame of the hymn. Lines 1–4 correspond to 
lines 29–36 thematically and form the second frame, presenting the initial praise 
for Marduk’s anger and relenting (lines 1–4) and his paramount position among 
the gods with regard to the same (29–36). Only here, as noted above, does one 
find both anger and mercy mentioned within the same line (lines 2, 4, 33, and 
34). The core of the hymn, according to Albertz, may be divided into three equal 
parts: lines  5–12,  13–20,  and  21–28.  Each  of  these  develop  the theme  of  Mar-
duk’s anger and relenting with regard to the deity’s character (lines 5–12) or the 
impact of  Marduk’s  anger and relenting on humanity (lines 13–20 and 21–28). 
Albertz sees each of these core parts breaking down further into two antithetical 
couplets  followed by  a  four line  strophe  (of  varied  structure:  A,  B,  Aʹ,  B,  as  in 
lines  9–12,  or  A,  B,  C  //  D, as  in  lines  17–20  and  25–282).  Although  one may 
balk  at  interpreting  the  final twelve lines of the  hymn  (nearly  a  third  of  it)  as 
part of its frame, Albertz’s analysis brings out several important features of the 
text. Moreover, the remainder of the article shows how the introductory hymn 
orients the interpretation of the entire poem. 

Moran presents a much simpler structure. As he reads it, the hymn consists 
of three parts, each of which starts with a 1cs precative verb. Part one begins in 
line 1, two in line 37, and three in line 39. The first part he calls “objective, “for 
it  hymns  the  wrath  and  mercy  of  Marduk  without  specific  reference  to  the 
speaker.”  The  second  part  tells  of  the  speaker’s  experience;  and  the  third  “an-
nounces  his  intention  to  provide  the  people  with  instruction  in  the  worship of 
Marduk.”3  Although  one  might  hesitate  to  see  three  parts  so  distinguished,  the 
use of first person precatives at the beginning and then again only at the end of 
the hymn is surely significant (as Albertz would affirm, too). On the one hand, 
the absence of the first person from lines 2–36 practically hides the speaker for 
 
1  This style is also evidenced in lines 1–4, but this strophe does not employ antithetical couplets. 
2  His understanding of line 27 differs significantly from the text presented below.

most of the hymn and thereby emphasizes the hymn’s central concern, Marduk’s 
character.  On  the  other  hand,  despite  its  limited  usage,  the  first  person  voice 
turns the hymn into a testimonial account, and the precatives generate a perlo-
cutionary  effect  of  exhortation  and  instruction—common  in  hymnic  discourse. 
Despite presenting Marduk as its prominent theme, therefore, the hymn is actu-
ally quite personal and intends to expand Marduk’s claim over the lives of those 
who hear it.

1.    lud-lul EN né-me-qí DINGIR muš-[ta-lum] 
 

 Line 1: Dalālu,  “to praise.” As many  of the prayers in this volume have shown,  the 
1cs precative form of dalālu, ludlul, is frequently found in the closing line(s) of prayers as 
part  of  the  common  “promise  of  praise”  motif.  Here  the  word  ludlul  opens  the  text  and 
marks its hymnic tone. The initial first person verb signals that the hymn is uttered by the 
sufferer  in  the  poem,  a man  named  Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan  (see III  44,  IV  111,  and  IV 
119). But the first person voice fades completely from view with the second word of the 
line. The large majority of the remaining hymn is centered on describing and praising the 
object of the initial verb, Marduk, the “lord of wisdom.” The first person voice only returns 
in the hymn’s closing lines (I 37 and 39). EN = bēlu, “lord.” Nēmequ, “wisdom.” Bēl X is a 
common  construction  in  Akkadian.  When  referring  to  humans  bēl  can  designate,  among 
other  things,  a  person  responsible  for  or  possessor  of  the  noun  that  follows,  whether  an 
office, object, or something more abstract (see CAD B, 198; e.g., bēl šutummi, “steward of 
the storehouse,” bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” or bēl dabābi, “adversary” [lit. “owner of a law-

suit”]). Similarly with deities (see CAD B, 193). For example, Ea is called bēl pirištim, “lord 
of the secret council,” in an OB text from Malgium. Bēl nēmeqi, “lord of wisdom,” here and 
in line 3 identifies Marduk as the divine possessor and distributor of wisdom. DINGIR = ilu, 
“god.” Muštālu, “thoughtful, deliberate, circumspect.” As mimation had disappeared in SB 
Akkadian, one may also read the word as muš-ta-lu4. In any case, we expect an acc. case 
here, since ilu muštālum is in apposition to the object of the verb, bēl nēmeqi. Muštālum is 
also used to translate one of Marduk’s names in Enūma eliš VI 137 alongside eziz (see our 
line  2).  See  also  AN  =  dA-nu-um  (Richard  L.  Litke,  A  Reconstruction  of  the  Assyro-
Babylonian  God-Lists,  AN  :  dan-nu-um  and  AN  :  anu  ša amēli  [Texts  from  the  Babylonian 
Collection 3; New Haven: Yale Babylonian Collection, 1998], 90: 192). 

ludlul bēl nēmeqi ilu muštālum 
 
Line 2: Ezēzu, “to be(come) angry, to rage.” The form of the word is a 3ms predica-
tive.  (Participles  of  stative  verbs  occur  only  rarely  outside  of  proper  names,  see  GAG 
§85d.)  Mūšu,  “night.”  Napšuru  (N  of  pašāru),  “to  be  released,  to  become  reconciled,  to 
forgive.” Urru, “daybreak, day.” Note the use of the participle in parallel to the predicative 
eziz. The alternation in this line between negative and positive attributes or images of the 
deity sets the pattern for the remainder of the hymn, with only a few exceptions. 
 
eziz mūši muppašir urri 
 
Line 3: Adopting the typical Sumerian hymnic style, the opening couplet is repeated 
nearly  verbatim  in  lines  3–4.  The  major  difference,  of  course,  is  that  the  deity’s  name, 
dAMAR.UTU = Marduk, replaces the initial verb in line 1. This is a slight variation from the 
norm. See lines 9–12. For similar uses of this hymnic form in prayers, see Mayer, UFBG, 40. 

Marduk bēl nēmeqi ilu muštālum 
   
Line 4: In a society that relied on oil lamps and the moon for light after sundown, the 
night would be an apt association with negative emotions such as anger and fear. The first 
light of dawn would have been a welcomed relief from the darkness. 

eziz mūši muppašir urri 
   
Line 5: The opening relative pronoun (ša) indicates the line is dependent on an earlier 
noun, namely, Marduk. Since the subject of the nominal clause that follows, uggatu, “fury, 
rage,” has a resumptive 3ms pronominal suffix on it (–šu, indicated in the writing as –su 
since  the  cluster  –tš–  becomes  –ss–),  the  relative  particle  is  best  translated  as  “whose.” 
Kīma, “like, as.” UD = ūmu, “day,” but the word can also be read as the homonymous ūmu, 
“storm,”  often used  to describe demons. Meḫû, “storm.” Based on equivalencies found in 
lexical  and  bilingual  texts  (see  the  citations  in  AHw,  642,  1420  and  CAD  M/2,  4–5),  it 
seems most likely that ūmi meḫê in construct means something like “very violent storm.” 
Namû,  “steppe,  deserted  area,  pasture  lands.”  Marduk’s  anger  is  likened  to  a  powerful 
natural force that leaves destruction in its wake.

Line 6: U, “and.” Given the fact that the statements in lines 5 and 6 are antithetical, 
one  might  translate  the  conjunction  as  an  adversative,  “but.”  Kī  (kî),  “like,  as.”  Mānitu, 
“breeze,  gentle  wind.”  Šērtu,  “morning,”  pl.  šērētu,  “morning  hours.”  Zâqu,  “to  blow,  to 
waft, to gust.” The inf. is being used as a gerund here. Ṭābu, “sweet, good.” The adj. is 3ms 
predicative (ṭāb) with the subjunctive –u (line 7 is still part of the relative clause begun in 
line 6). Notice the grammatical parallelism between lines 5 and 6. In a land known for its 
scorching temperatures, the morning breeze must have been an especially comfortable and 
enjoyable part of the day, thus making it an apt simile for Marduk in a favorable mood. 
 
   
Line 7:  Uzzu,  “anger, rage.” The form  includes the locative-adverbial suffix –um (= 
ina) before the 3ms pronominal suffix (–šu); the m of the former has assimilated to the š of 
latter (–mš– becomes –šš–). Maḫāru, “to confront, to face, to oppose.” Lā maḫār, a negated 
inf. in the absolute form, literally means “not confronting,” thus “unstoppable, irresistible, 
not opposable.” Abūbu, “flood,” is often used metaphorically to characterize the inexorable 
power of a deity’s anger, a king’s military actions, or either’s weapons (see CAD A/1, 78–
79). Rūbu, “anger,  turmoil, fury.” Juxtaposing the words abūbu and lā maḫār in  this line 
conveys the overwhelming power of Marduk’s anger. Like water breaking through a levee, 
it cannot easily be stopped.  
 
   
Line  8:  Mussaḫḫiru,  “merciful,”  probably  based  on  the  Gtn  participle  of  saḫāru,  “to 
turn back/towards someone with concern, favor,” is a 3ms predicative (note the lack of a 
case ending). See CAD M/2, 235 (s.v. mussaḫru) for the one other known instance of this 
word, also used predicatively. Karšu, lit. “stomach,” but here it means “mind, mood.” The 
form of the word used with suffixes, karaš–, puts the final consonant adjacent to the š of 
the 3ms pronominal suffix. The resulting –šš– becomes –ss–. Kabattu (also kabtatu, see line 
36),  lit.  “liver,”  but  here  it  means  “mood,  temper,  emotions.”  Târu,  “to  return,  to  turn 
back, to relent.” This form is also predicative (3fs).

Line 9: Nakbatu, “weight, combat power, main force.” Qātu, “hand.” Nakbat qātīšu is 
the  object  of  the  verb  in  this  line.  Našû,  “to  lift,  to  carry,  to  bear.”  Šamāʾū  (šamāmū), 
“heavens,”  is  a  poetic  term  synonymous  with  the  more  common  šamû.  Marduk’s  over-
whelming power is unbearable even at the cosmic level.

Line 10: Rittu, “hand, palm.” The final vowel of the 3ms suffix has been elided. Com-
pare line 12. Rabbu (m), rabbatu  (f), “soft, gentle.” Given  the fact that two Assyrian  MSS 
read rabbat here (MSS AA and ff, partially restored), it is probably best to understand rab-
bati, attested in two late Babylonian MSS (MSS gg and ii), as a 3fs predicative with a super-
fluous  vowel  attached—not  atypical  in  late  manuscripts.  Mītu  means  “dead.”  “Dead”  is 
probably not to be understood here as the cessation of all bodily functions but as “mori-
bund, dying, as good as dead.” Kuššu (D of kâšu) is problematic. Formally, it is a 3cs dura-
tive  with  subjunctive.  Semantically,  however,  one  can  take  it  to  mean  “to  help”  (CDA’s 
kiāšu;  CAD’s  kâšu  B)  or  “to  delay”  (CDA’s  kâšu;  CAD’s  kâšu  A).  If  one  accepts  the  latter 
verb, one must take the phrase to mean “it delays (the death of) the dying” (see, e.g., CAD 
K, 295). If one accepts the former verb, one faces the problem that the CAD offers no cer-
tain attestations of this verb in the D stem (K, 295). This issue has been mollified slightly 
by the fact that new material in Ludlul IV 26 (according to the line numbering of Annus 
and Lenzi) does attest it in a broken line that occurs in a context of the sufferer recounting 
his salvation:  [ . . .  ] ukaššu Zarpān[ītu],  “whom Zarpanitu helps.” Given this attestation 
and  the  fact  that  “help”  or  “rescue”  makes  contextual  sense  in  line  10,  this  rendering 
seems  to  be  the  most  likely  understanding  of  the  verb  (see  likewise  Foster,  395;  George 
and Al-Rawi, 194). Marduk, this line states, can also be tender and caring, rescuing those 
destined for the grave. 
 
   
Line 11: Lines 9–12 employ the Sumerian hymnic style by repeating a couplet, first 
without the deity’s name and then with it.  Unlike  lines 1 and 3, which also employ this 
literary form, the insertion of the deity’s name in line 11 does not replace a word in line 9. 
This is the typical execution of the form. 
 
   
Line 12: The line varies from its mate in line 10 in that the initial pair of words has 
switched places. Notice also that the 3ms pronominal suffix on rittu shows its final vowel 
in this line. 
 
   
Line 13: Ina, “in, on, by, among,  from,” is best understood here as “on account of.” 
Libbātu, pl. “wrath, fury.” Putattû (Dt of petû), “to be opened.” Qabru, “grave.” The opening 
(i.e., digging) of graves suggests the need to bury the dead, the apparent result of Marduk’s 
anger.

Line 14: Inūšu (Assyrian, enūšu, rendered enuššu in MS ff from Nimrud, for which see 
George  and  Al-Rawi,  197),  “at  that  time,  then.”  Karašû  (karāšu),  “disaster,  catastrophe.” 
Generally, maqtu indicates a destitute person or a fugitive—one who has fallen through the 
social safety net, so to speak (see CAD M/1, 254–55). Lines 13 and 14 indicate that many 
people will die when Marduk is angry, but he also has mercy on the devastated survivors 
of his wrath. 
 
   
Line 15:  Nekelmû,  “to  frown  at.” The  form  of  the  word is  N  3cs  durative.  Nesû,  “to 
withdraw, to be distant.” Lamassu (= dLAMMA) and šēdu (= dALAD) are anonymous tutelary 
deities of individuals, temples, gates, or cities, who are, as line 16 shows, distinct from but 
conceptually related to one’s personal god (ilu). Lamassu and šēdu, female and male respec-
tively,  appear  together  frequently  in  inscriptions  and  texts  (see  CAD  L,  63–64  and  Š/2, 
257–58). Lamassū are depicted in iconography as female deities in a human form leading 
devotees before a seated god. Acquiring (rašû) a divine guardian  is a stroke  of good for-
tune for a person. One benefits from their divine protection as these deities walk at one’s 
side (ida alāku, see Ludlul I 45) or go before and behind (pāni u arki alāku) their ward. But 
when these agents of protection withdraw (nesû), leave (ezēbu), re-deploy themselves (šanâ 
saḫāru, “to turn to another,” šanâ šeʾû, “to search for another”; see Ludlul I 46), get angry 
(e.g., ezēzu), or the like, one is exposed to danger because the divine hedge of protection is 
removed.  In  our  line  Marduk  simply  glowers  and  these  protective  agents  dismiss  them-
selves, leaving their ward open to harm. Clearly Marduk’s displeasure is enough to scare 
off the lowly tutelary deities. Conversely, a mere glance of concern from Marduk as line 16 
says, and one’s divine protectors return. The hierarchy of the divine world closely parallels 
human  social  interaction:  the  human  and  divine  kings’  decisions  trump  all  lower-level 
contracts  or  agreements.  Even  the  terseness  that  relates  Marduk’s  mood  in  these  lines 
(ikkelemmû-ma  and  ippallas-ma)  suggests  he  need  only  speak  a  single  word  and  others 
scramble to fall into line. This is precisely how one expects peons to behave under an abso-
lute ruler. 
 
   
Line 16: Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to see, to look at,” often though not exclusively im-
plies a benevolent intent. Ana begins a prepositional phrase in which a subordinate clause 
(starting with ša) is embedded. Sakāpu, “to push away, to reject, to forsake.” The subject of 
this verb must be the personal god, mentioned next in the line. The pronominal suffix on 
this verb is resumptive, referring to the same person as does the initial ša, that is, the hu-
man ward of the god. There is some question, however, about the subject of the final verb 
isaḫḫuršu,  from  saḫāru,  “to  turn  (back)  to,  to  show  favor  to.”  Some  take  Marduk  as  the 
subject (e.g., D. J. Wiseman, “A New Text of the Babylonian Poem of the Righteous Suffer-
er,” AnSt 30 [1980], 105; von Soden, TUAT III/1, 115, and W. Horowitz and W. G. Lam-
bert, “A New Exemplar of Ludlul Bēl Nēmeqi Tablet I from Birmingham,” Iraq 64 [2002],

19.   id-du-ud-ma ri-ma-šu ú-kan-ni 
 
245), which is grammatically possible. If, however, one reads the previous line in parallel 
with line 16, then a pattern emerges in which Marduk’s action is followed by the divine 
protectors’ reaction. In this case, ilšu, “his god,” is the most likely subject of isaḫḫuršu (thus 
the personal god is the subject of both verbs after the –ma). The pronominal suffix on the 
verb  is  therefore  3ms  dative  (–šum,  with  the  loss  of  the  final  m)  and  refers  to  the  same 
person as  the ana  ša  phrase  in  the  middle  of  the line  (see  likewise  George and  Al-Rawi, 
197 and others listed there). 
 
   
Line 17:  Akṣu, “dangerous,  overbearing, terrible.” The adjective is a 3fs predicative. 
Ana  surri,  “immediately,  soon.”  Ennettu  (ennittu),  “punishment.”  Kabtu  (m),  kabittu  (f), 
“heavy, important, grave, grievous.” Marduk’s terrible wrath is quick to strike.  
 
   
Line 18: Nakruṭu (N of karāṭu), “to be merciful, to show pity.” (This part of the hymn 
was not known to CAD K [1971], 215 or N/1 [1980], 196. One may wish to add this refer-
ence.) Zamar, “quickly, immediately.” Târu, “to turn, to return, to turn into, to become.” 
Several NB MSS read a final vowel on the verb here. As George and Al-Rawi explain on the 
basis of a study in NB grammar (198), NB has a tendency to add such final vowels to dura-
tives of middle weak roots (sometimes in II-y roots and very often in II-w roots, like târu). 
Ālittu, “mother, one who gives birth.” The š on the noun may be an apocopated 3ms suffix. 
Or, as George and Al-Rawi believe, the –uš ending is a late form of the adverbial –iš and 
ālittuš should be translated “like a mother” (see likewise Foster, 395). In either case, line 
18  shows  that  Marduk in  a  merciful  mood  can  quickly  turn  “motherly”  toward  humans. 
The semantic contrast in the couplet of lines 17–18 is complemented by the phonological 
similarities between them. Compare the k and t sounds in akṣat and ikkarriṭ, the sibiliant 
(s, z) and r sounds in surri and zamar, and the t and š sounds in ennittašu kabitti and ālittuš. 
 
    
Line 19: Lines 19–20, as presently understood, break the pattern of alternating nega-
tive and positive images. Edēdu is difficult. All extant MSS read the verb as iddud, a G dura-
tive.  Normally,  the  verb  in the  G  stem  means  “to  be(come)  pointed.”  But  this  makes no 
sense in context. The D stem’s meaning, on the other hand, when in hendiadys (as our verb 
seems  to  be  with  kunnû),  is  quite  suitable  to  our  context,  “to  do  something  quickly,  to 
hasten to” (see CAD E, 24; note the adverbs ana surri and zamar in lines 17 and 18). But 
our verb is clearly a G stem. If, however, the alternative restoration of Ludlul II 81 is cor-
rect ([i]-du-ud), there may be another attestation of the G stem with the meaning “to has-
ten”  (see  Annus  and  Lenzi,  xxvii,  n.50,  correcting  the  Akkadian  there  to  [i]-du-ud,  and 
Moran, 260). Given this possibility and the propensity for our author to use rare verbs or 
verbs  in  otherwise  rarely  attested  stems  (see  Annus  and  Lenzi,  xxvii),  translating  the  G 
with the D stem’s meaning “to hasten to” is the only reasonable and viable alternative at 
present. Rîmu (reʾmu, CAD R, 259), “beloved.” Though it is a rarely attested word, it makes

better contextual sense than rīmu, “bull.” As Foster notes (395, n.2), rîmu, “beloved,” may 
be punning on rīmu, “bull,” given the bovine references in line 20. MS gg personalizes this 
noun with a 1cs pronominal suffix, “my beloved,” against MS ff’s 3ms suffix accepted here 
(see the next line, too). But MS gg’s reading seems less satisfactory from a literary perspec-
tive. Kunnû (D of kanû), “to care for, to treat kindly.” 
 

iddud-ma rîmašu ukanni 

    
Line 20:  Arḫu,  “cow.”  Būru, “calf.” In keeping with  the  “motherly” language of line 
18,  Marduk  is  compared  to  a  cow  with  a  calf.  Arkīšu,  “behind  it/him.”  In  light  of  the 
meaning of verb, the “him” is probably best understood as a reference to the cow/Marduk. 
Itasḫuru (Ntn of saḫāru ), “to keep turning back/around, to be constantly in attendance.” 
Ittanasḫara is a 3cs durative with the ventive. Just as a cow keeps turning around behind it 
to look at its calf, so Marduk does to his ward. The variant in MS gg, arkīya, “behind me,” 
does not fit this imagery. Instead, it would seem to be working with the analogy of a cow 
turning  around  to  get  physically  behind  the  calf,  perhaps  to  direct  it.  The  variants  may 
correspond to two different stages of cow behavior in relationship to her calf. “When the 
calf is first  born, the  cow  will nudge the calf  from behind,  encouraging it to walk. After 
that, the calf follows the mother, and she will look back to check on it” (personal commu-
nication from Ms. Jauson King, a bovine expert). Moran notes that the “cow looking back,” 
especially as the calf nurses, is a common motif in ancient Near Eastern art (“The Babylo-
nian Job,” in The Most Magic Words: Essays on Babylonian and Biblical Literature [ed. Ronald 
S. Hendel; CBQMS 35; Washington, D.C.: Catholic Biblical Association of America, 2002], 
194).   
 

u kī araḫ būri ittanasḫara arkīšu 

zaqtā niṭâtūšu usaḫḫalā zumra 

    
Line 21: Zaqtu, “pointed, barbed.” The adjective is a 3fp predicative. Niṭâtu, pl. “beat-
ings.” Saḫālu, “to prick, to pierce.” Zumru, “body.” MS gg, in keeping with its previous two 
lines’  1cs  suffixes,  preserves  zumrī,  “my  body.”  Lines  21  and  22  renew  the  antithetical 
couplet pattern observed earlier in the hymn. Despite the semantic antithesis, the two lines 
show very close grammatical parallelism (but note the alteration between feminine  [line 
21] and masculine [line 22] grammatical gender). 
 
    
Line 22: Pašḫu, “soothing, resting.” The adjective is a 3mp predicative. Ṣindu (ṣimdu), 
“bandage.” Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to revive, to restore to health, to cure, to support.” Nam-
taru, “death, fate, (name of a demon).” The object of the verb is always the person receiv-
ing care, not the thing for which they need a cure. Since it is unlikely that Marduk heals or 
revives  a  demon  or  death,  one  should  probably  supply  some  words  for  sense:  “the  one 
afflicted by” or the like. The hymn once again affirms Marduk’s compassionate nature as 
do many other texts. Note, e.g., this phrase from Šurpu VII 77: Marduk bēlu rēmēnû ša mīta 
bulluṭa irammu, “Marduk, the merciful lord, who loves to heal the dying” (CAD M/2, 140).

Line  23:  Qabû,  “to  speak.”  Gillatu,  “sin.”  Ušrašši  is a  ŠD  durative  from  rašû,  “to  ac-
quire.” According to Moran, this is the first attestation of rašû in this stem (258). Its mean-
ing here is causative, “to cause someone to acquire something.” In light of gillatu, “to im-
pute” seems a contextually appropriate definition. Marduk need only speak and he reckons 
sin to someone’s account. The offending party is not even mentioned. Whatever one’s ac-
tions may be, it is the judgment of Marduk that determines one’s guilt. This shows another 
side to Marduk’s absolute sovereignty.  
 
    
Line  24:  Išartu,  “prosperity,  righteousness,  justice.”  Putaṭṭuru  (Dt  of  paṭāru),  “to  be 
released,  to  be  forgiven.”  Eʾiltu,  “bond,  liability,  sin.”  Annu  (arnu),  “guilt,  penalty,  fault, 
sin.” The couplet in lines 23–24 shows several structural and grammatical parallelisms to 
the one in lines 25–26. 
 
    
Line 25: Šū-ma is the 3ms independent pronoun, “he,” with the enclitic –ma. It em-
phasizes the implied subject of the verb, Marduk. Utukku, “demon,” is in apposition to the 
following noun:  raʾību, “shivering, cramp,” also known to  be the name of  the demon be-
hind the medical condition (see qāt Raʾību, CAD R, 81). Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause some-
one to acquire (something).” This is the more common causative stem for rašû. One’s trans-
lation  must  supply  the  second  object,  the  person  on  whom  the  disease  is  imposed. 
Although Marduk imputes guilt and causes illness, the hymn is (apparently) free of cyni-
cism  or  bitterness.  Marduk’s  capricious  disposition  is  simply  accepted.  Apart  from  some 
very poignant but passing protest in Tablet II (lines 10–47), Ludlul’s author seems resigned 
to the will and ways of Marduk (see II 48). 
 
    
Line 26: Tû, “incantation.” Marduk and his father Ea were famous for their effective 
incantatory  word  (see,  e.g.,  Enūma  eliš  IV  19–28,  61;  VI  153;  VII  11,  26,  33–34 and  the 
prayer to Ea in this volume, page 227). Šuruppû, “frost, chills.” Ḫurbāšu, “frost, shivering, 
cold tremors.” The verb ušdapparu is another ŠD stem durative from the root duppuru (so 
CAD D, 186–88, defended by William Moran, “duppuru [dubburu] — ṭuppuru, too?” JCS 33 
[1981], 44–47) or ṭuppuru (D of ṭapāru, so AHw, 1380 and CDA, 413). The meaning of the 
ŠD, attested only here to my knowledge, follows the D stem, “to drive away.” The final –u 
on the verb (in all three MSS attesting this line, MSS gg, ff, and JJ, from Babylon, Nimrud, 
and  Nineveh,  respectively)  presents  a  problem  with  regard  to  the  subject  of  the  verb.  If 
šuruppû and ḫurbāšu are the subjects (and the final –ū is the 3mp suffix on the verb), we 
would expect the verb to be passive, “they were driven away.” We might even expect this 
grammatical understanding given the other parallels between lines 23–24 and 25–26 (note 
especially  the compound subject at the  end of line 24 and the  passive,  plural verb in its

middle). But the verb clearly is not passive—at least, if the decipherment is correct. That 
leaves Marduk as the subject and the unnecessary final –u on the verb, which cannot be 
explained as a subjunctive. Given this impasse, perhaps we could explain the –u as a scrib-
al mistake, the result of an early scribe understanding šuruppû and ḫurbāšu as the subject of 
the  (rare)  verb  due  to  the  false  expectation  generated  by  the  parallelisms  between  lines 
23–24 and  25–26.  But  this  is  only  a  conjecture.  When  the  textual  basis  for  this  line  im-
proves, a clearer answer may arise. 
 
    
Line 27:  Riḫiṣtu,  “flooding.”  George  and  Al-Rawi, 198  disagree  with  this  restoration 
but  offer  no  alternative.  Miḫiṣtu,  “strike,  blow,  wound.”  Notice  the  consonance  between 
the two words.  dIŠKUR = Adad, a storm god. Erra was a god associated with war, plague, 
and destruction (see page 85). The first word of the line is very problematic. The signs that 
comprise the verb are securely attested (in one MS) but there is widespread disagreement 
about  how  to  understand  them  (see  George  and  Al-Rawi,  198  for  several  options). 
Mušmanṭi is here assumed to stand for mušmaṭṭi, a proposed ŠD participle of the root maṭû, 
“to be(come) small.” A very tentative understanding of the verb as “who makes slight” (see 
the meaning of the D stem) aligns itself with Foster’s “who dwarfs(?)” (395). On this ren-
dering,  the  line suggests  that Marduk’s rage is  so severe that it makes the destruction  of 
Adad and Erra seem small. This understanding stands in contrast with the mercy Marduk 
effects in  I  28.  But  like  so  many other  translation  problems  in Ludlul,  this  solution  must 
remain tentative. 
 
    
sonal) goddess.” Šabbasû, “very angry.” The adj. is mp and modifies both ilu and ištaru. 
 
    
Line 29: A renewed invocation begins the line. Lines 29–32 underline Marduk’s abso-
lute inscrutability and therefore superiority even among his peers, the other gods. Mimma, 
“everything, anything, all.” ŠÀ = libbu, “heart, mind.” Barû, “to see.” Marduk sees, which 
implies he knows, everything the gods are doing. 
 
    
Line 30: Manāma, “someone,” with negative, “no one.” Alaktu, “way, course,” refers 
to Marduk’s decisions. No one among the gods can determine Marduk’s intent (see line 32.) 
Ul, “not.” Edû (idû), “to know.” Īde is preterite in form but the tense of the verb must be 
derived from context. 
 

Line 28: Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to soothe, to reconcile, to create peace.” Ištaru, “(per-

Line  32:  Line  32  repeats  the  sense  of  line  30  in  different  words.  Ayyumma,  “any,” 
with  negative, “none, no one.” Lamādu, “to learn.” Ṭēnu  (ṭēmu), “(fore)thought, plan, in-
struction, understanding.” The n of this noun assimilates to the following š in the pronom-
inal suffix (see the normalization). 
 
ilu ayyumma ul ilammad ṭēššu 
    
Line 33: The unusual construction ana kī (von Soden, TUAT III/1, 117) prepares for a 
contrastive  comparison  of  Marduk’s  nature  in  the  first  and  second  halves  of  each  of  the 
following two lines. This intra-line contrast (rather than contrasting adjacent lines) has not 
appeared in the hymn since lines 2 and 4. For kabtu, see line 17. For qātu, see line 9 and 
note that –tš– (at the junction of the noun and suffix) changes to –ss–. Rēmēnû, “merciful.” 
In lines 33–34, the first half of the line concerns instruments on the exterior of the body 
that are capable of violence (hand, a bodily agent, and weapons, the hand’s instrument). 
The  second  half  describes  internal  body  parts,  representing  positive  intentions  and/or 
emotions. 
 
    
Line  34:  Gaṣṣu,  “cruel,  murderous.”  GIŠ.TUKUL  =  kakku,  “weapon.”  For  kabattu,  see 
line 8. Šunuššu (Š of nêšu), “to keep alive, to sustain.” The form of the word is a participle 
used predicatively (3fs). Marduk is called an ilu mušneššu in Enūma eliš VI 151. 
 
    
Line 35: Ša lā, “without.” “Without his heart, mind” seems to refer to a lack of Mar-
duk’s consent. Mannu, “who?” Šupšuḫu (Š of pašāḫu), “to cause to rest, to pacify, to calm.” 
Without Marduk’s consent, no one can avert what he inflicts. 
 
    
Line 36: This line restates the idea in line 35 in different words. Ela, “apart from, in 
the absence of.” Ayyu, “which (person)?” Šūlulu (Š of alālu), “to cause to hang,” with qātu 
as object, “to stay one’s hand.” The line makes clear that no one can thwart what Marduk 
intends  to  do.  Obviously,  lines  35–36  are  not  internally  contrastive  as  lines  33–34  were 
nor do they form an antithetical couplet as many of the previous lines do. Rather, the cou-
plet seems to end this part of the hymn on a negative note, emphasizing Marduk’s unstop-

pable prerogative to punish. Miḫiṣtu (as in line 27) and qātu are the objects of the verbs in 
each of these lines. Just as qātu the agent was paired to kakkū the instrument in line 33, 
qātu the agent is here paired to miḫiṣtu the agent’s action. 
 
    
Line 37: Šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to make manifest, to make glorious, to proclaim.” Lines 
37 and 39 return to the first person voice, which has been absent in the poem since line 1. 
Like line 1, both verbs are in the precative and, conspicuously, commence their respective 
lines. Uggatu, see line 5. The rest of line 37 is a subordinate clause that further describes 
the  first  person  speaker.  kīma,  see  line  5.  Nūnu,  “fish.”  Akālu,  “to  eat.”  Rušumtu,  “mud, 
silt.”  Fish and birds are attested in rituals describing the most  distant  removal of an  un-
wanted item,  e.g.,  sin  (see  the  examples  cited in  CAD  N/2,  339).  The  two  animals  have 
access to the extremes of the cosmos in that birds fly to the heavens and fish swim into the 
depths. Here in line 37 the sufferer is using the fish simile, I think, to state that he was at 
the lowest point to which a creature could descend. The simile probably reflects the fact 
that  a  common  fish  in  the  Euphrates,  carp,  was  a  bottom  dweller  that  would  scour  the 
riverbed for food. 
 
    
Line 38: A pair of couplets (lines 37–40) closes the hymn, though they are not strong-
ly antithetical as in previous lines. There is, however, a clear antithesis in terms of agents. 
In the first member of each couplet the (first person) speaker of the hymn is the subject of 
the  verbs  (see  the  first  person  verbs  in  lines 37 and  39).  In  the  second  member  of  each 
couplet (lines 38 and 40), Marduk or one of his attributes is subject. Enēnu, “to grant fa-
vor.”  The  –am  ending  on  the  verb  is  the  1cs  dative  suffix,  showing  to  whom  favor  was 
granted.  Enēnu  here  is  an  a/u  verb  whereas  the  homonymous  root  used  in  Ludlul  I  41, 
meaning  to “punish,” is i/i. Zamar, see line 18 (compare the use  of  arḫiš in Ludlul  III 50 
and  the  problematic  IV  28,  according  to  Annus  and  Lenzi’s  numbering,  to  describe  the 
sufferer’s  rapid  recovery).  Kī  here  probably  means  “when,”  “like,”  or  “just  as”  (compare 
line 6). Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), see line 22. Mītūtu could be understood as the abstract noun 
“(state of) death.” In this case, we would need to supply, as in line 22, “the one afflicted 
by.”  More  likely,  one  could  understand  mītūtu  as  a  pl.  substantival  use  of  the  adj.  mītu, 
“dead” (see similarly line 10). In any case, the idea in the line is that the sufferer eventual-
ly becomes the object of Marduk’s mercy, which he has extolled earlier. 
 
    
Line 39: Šulmudu (Š of lamādu), “to teach.” UN.MEŠ = nišū, “people.” On the sufferer’s 
role as teacher, see also Ludlul II  18, 32, and III line p. Qitrubu  (Gt of qerēbu), “to come 
close  up,”  in  the  pred.  means  “is  imminent.”  Qitruba  is  a  3ms  pred.  with  the  ventive. 
Gumālu is a hapax, according to George and Al-Rawi (198), and may mean something like 
“mercy,  clemency”  (see  the  CDA’s  online  archive  at  http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/ 
cda_archive/lemmata.htm). It is currently not in any of the dictionaries. MS ff, though bro-

ken (gi-[mil-šin]), probably used the more common cognate gimillu, “favor, a turn in kind 
(both requested and bestowed),” here. Since the purās-noun formation is often used with 
prayer-words (see GAG §55k sub 15b), we might place gumālu in this semantic field; thus, 
the  word  could  be specifically defined as  “a  plea  for favor,  mercy,  clemency  (something 
both requested and bestowed).” The 3fp pronominal suffix on the noun associates gumālu 
with nišū (fp), mentioned earlier in the line. This antecedent to the pronoun creates a par-
allel with the noun to which –šina is attached in line 40. 
 
    
Line  40:  The  term  ḫissatu  is  used  elsewhere  to  indicate  intelligence,  understanding, 
remembrance, or thought for someone (see CAD Ḫ, 201 and CDA, 117). There are only a 
couple of instances in which the term is used with deities, the most important of which for 
our purposes describes a person “who recovered on account of the ḫissatu of Marduk,” [ša 
ina]  ḫissat  Marduk  ibluṭu  (cited  in  CAD  Ḫ,  202).  The  CAD  translates  ḫissatu  here  with 
“grace.” However one  chooses to  translate the  term, it ought  to convey the general idea 
that Marduk  shows  benevolent  consideration  for  people.  SIG5  =  damqu  (m),  damiqtu  (f), 
“good,  favorable,  kind.”  Arnu,  see  line  24.  This  reconstruction  is  highly  questionable  in 
light of a re-examination of MS ff, which is the only tablet that preserves any hint of the 
word that once lay before the pronominal suffix. Tabālu, “to carry off, to take away.” The 
sufferer ends his hymn with a wish that builds on the optimistic statement in line 39: that 
Marduk, having heard the people’s plea, will take away their sin. This is the only time in 
the entire opening hymn that we see an explicit statement attributing sin to humans.

COMPARATIVE SUGGESTIONS:  

 
Our  hymn  offers  many  points  of  departure  for  the  reader  inclined  to  com-
pare it with biblical literature. Divine anger and its impact on human experience 
are probably the most obvious and broadest thematic issues communicated in the 
hymn. But space does not allow even a foray into this vast and complex subject.1 
Rather,  the  comparative  suggestions  here  are  limited  to  two  more  manageable 
issues: the use of BH’s cognate to bēlu, ל ַ ַבּ, and the cultural-literary associations 
of the morning hours of the day. 

The Akkadian construction bēl X, “lord of X,” has an etymological equivalent 
in BH’s X ל ַ ַבּ, “lord of X.” Like its Akkadian mate, this phrase can refer to a per-
son responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows. Compare bēl šutummi, 
“steward of the storehouse,” with רי ִ ָה י ֵל ֲ ַבּ, “lords of the city, citizens” (e.g., Jud 
9:51); bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” with םי ִשׁ ָר ָפּ ַה  י ֵל ֲ ַבּ, “horsemen” (2 Sam 1:6); and 
bēl dabābi, “adversary” (lit. “owner of a lawsuit”) with י ִט ָפּ ְשׁ ִמ ל ַ ַבּ, “my adversary” 
(Isa 50:8; lit. “owner of my dispute”).  

 

1 Compare, e.g., the very different attitudes about and contexts for divine anger in Nah 1:2–8 and 
Job 9:2–24. The latter passage is remarkable for its bitterness, quite in contrast to what we see in 
Ludlul’s opening hymn. For a broad treatment of theodicy in the biblical world, see Antti Laato 
and Johannes C. de Moor, ed. Theodicy in the World of the Bible: The Goodness of God and the Prob-
lem of Evil (Leiden: Brill, 2003). 

 

 

ӎゞ A HYMN TO MARDUK: LUDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40 

497

Just as Akkadian bēlu came to be a proper name for Marduk (Bēl), the Bibli-
cal  Hebrew term ל ַ ַבּ was used as  an  epithet  and/or  name of  an  important Ca-
naanite storm-deity, Baal (Northwest Semitic, Baʿlu), who may be related to the 
Syrian and Mesopotamian Ḫaddu/Adad.1 Some of Baal’s local manifestations are 
attested in the Bible: Baal-Peor (see, e.g., Num 25:3, 5), Baal-Berith (god of She-
chem, see Judg 8:33, 9:4), and Baal-Zebub (“Lord of the flies,” god of Ekron in 2 
Kings  1,  though  this  title  is  probably  a  distortion  of  the  original  Baal-Zebul, 
“Lord  Prince”);2  still  other  local  manifestations  are  preserved  in  nine  biblical 
toponyms  (e.g.,  Baal-Gad  in  Josh  11:17,  12:7,  and  13:3).3  Although  some  of 
Baal’s features were appropriated into the mythology of Yahweh by biblical au-
thors,4 the use of  the originally  generic term ל ַ ַבּ  for the  Canaanite deity moti-
vated other biblical authors to reject the term for Yahweh altogether (see espe-
cially  Hos  2:18,  but  note  the  PN  ה ָי ְל ַ ְבּ,  “Yahweh  is  lord,”  in  1  Chron  12:5). 
Apparently, so hated was the epithet/god that early scribes changed attestations 
of  the  god’s  name  in  the  Bible  to  the  derogatory  ת ֶשֹׁבּ ַה,  “the  shame”  (see  Jer 
3:24, 11:13, and Hos 9:10), even going so far as to replace the appellation with 
ת ֶשֹׁבּ when it appears as a theophoric element in personal names (compare, e.g., 
Ish-boshet in 2 Sam 2:8, etc. with Eshbaal in 1 Chron 8:33, 9:39).5 Of course, the 
biblical authors called Yahweh lord, but they did so with the term ןוֹד ָא.6 

This  Levantine  religious  polemic  may  have  made  the  Judean’s  encounter 
with Marduk’s related title, Bēl, during the Babylonian crisis of the sixth century 
all  the  more  bitter.  In  several  predictions  of  Babylonian  destruction  Judean 
 
1  Opinions  vary  on  the  identity  of Baal  and  Adad.  See  the  treatments  of  the  issue in  J.  C.  de 
Moor and M. J. Mulder, “ל ַ ַבּ baʿal,” TDOT 2:192–99; J. Day, “Baal (Deity),” ABD 1:543; and W. 
Herrmann, “Baal,” DDD, 132. For fuller treatments of the storm god, see Alberto R. W. Green, 
The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East (Biblical and Judaic Studies from the University of Califor-
nia, San Diego 8; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2003), who treats the biblical material, too, and the 
encyclopedic tome from Daniel Schwemer, Die Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens 
im Zeitalter der Keilschriftkulturen (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2001). See also the literature 
for Adad on page 88. 
2  See K. Spronk, “Baal of Peor,” DDD, 147–48; M. J. Mulder, “Baal-Berith,” DDD, 141–44; and W. 
Herrmann, “Baal Zebub,” DDD, 154–56. 
3  See the other eight toponyms in HALOT, 144 and N. Na’aman, “Baal Toponyms,” DDD, 140–41 
(and related entries). The plural form of the noun, םי ִל ָ ְבּ ָה, appears 18 times in the Hebrew Bible 
but its meaning is not entirely clear. The term may have been used for various local manifesta-
tions of Baal or a more generic term for Canaanite gods in general (see J. Day, “Baal (Deity),” 
547).  
4  See the convenient précis in Day, “Baal (Deity),” 548–49. A classic essay on this issue is Frank 
Moore Cross’s chapter “Yahweh and Baʿl” (pp. 147–94) in Canaanite  Myth and Hebrew Epic: Es-
says in the History of the Religion of Israel (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1973). See also 
Reinhard  Muller,  Jahwe  als  Wettergott:  Studien  zur  althebraischen  Kultlyrik  anhand  ausgewahlter 
Psalmen (BZAW 387; Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008). The use of storm imagery for Yahweh, of 
course, brings up a topic that intersects with our hymn (see line 5). 
5  See de Moor and Mulder, “ל ַ ַבּ baʿal,” 193, who note these changes are limited to the book of 
Samuel. 
6  See K. Spronk, “Lord,” DDD, 531–33 for more about this title, which eventually became a pious 
substitute (י ָנוֹד ֲא) for the Tetragrammaton.

READING AKKADIAN PRAYERS AND HYMNS: AN INTRODUCTION 

prophets  seem  to  relish  the  idea  of  the  great  Babylonian  Bel’s  (ל ֵבּ)  defeat  and 
putting to shame (see Jer 50:2, 51:44, and Isa 46:1–2). 
 
The opening several lines of our hymn associate Marduk’s favorable nature 
(i.e., relenting from anger) with the morning (see line 2, 4, and 6). This manner 
of speaking recalls passages in the Psalter that associate the morning with divine 
help or hope for divine mercy.7 Interestingly, several of these passages also occur 
in  the  context  of  a  person  lamenting  divine  displeasure.  See,  for  example,  Pss 
46:6, 59:17 (and contrast the psalmist’s enemies who are depicted as dogs roam-
ing about in the evening in vv. 7 and 15), 90:14 (with vv. 5–6), and 143:8. In Ps 
130:6 the  psalmist describes  themselves waiting  on  Yahweh’s favorable answer 
to their cry with more anticipation than the watchmen awaiting the appearance 
of  the  morning.  Such  a  comparison  confirms  rather  explicitly  the  expectation 
and hope associated with the morning hours. In light of our Akkadian hymn, Ps 
30:6  provides  a  particularly  interesting  example  of  the  contrast  between 
night/divine anger and morning/divine favor. In the context of thanksgiving for 
deliverance (vv. 2–4), the psalmist calls on others to praise Yahweh (v. 5), offer-
ing the following as further support for the exhortation to praise:  םיִיּ ַח וֹפּ ַא ְבּ ע ַג ֶר י ִכּ
ה ָנּ ִר ר ֶקֹבּ ַל ְו י ִכ ֶבּ ןי ִל ָי ב ֶר ֶ ָבּ וֹנוֹצ ְר ִבּ, “although (one is) a moment in his anger, (there is) a 
lifetime in his favor; weeping lodges in the evening, (but) jubilation belongs to 
the morning.”  The  Psalter  also presents the  morning  as  an  appropriate  time  to 
request  Yahweh’s  favor  (see  Pss  5:4  and  88:14)  and  indicates  in  Ps  101:8  that 
judgment of the wicked (i.e., vindication for the psalmist) occurs every morning 
(םי ִר ָק ְבּ ַל; see also Zeph 3:5). Clearly, the morning was often associated with good 
things for those in distress. This might make us read the lament in Ps 73:14 as 
especially bitter, for there the psalmist complains that every morning brings new 
afflictions (see also Ps 55:10, where the psalmist complains morning, noon, and 
night). 
  Why  exactly  the  morning  was  so  often  associated  with  expectation  of  or 
requests  for  Yahweh’s  favor  has  elicited  several  creative  explanations.8  Joseph 
Blenkinsopp  may  be  closest  to  understanding  the  issue  when  he  explains  the 
association as “simply the feeling that morning puts an end to night as a time of 
danger and fear; it is a time for new beginnings.”9 
 
7  The most famous passage in the Bible in this regard may be the optimistic statement in Lam 
3:22–23, where the kindnesses of Yahweh (ה ָוֹהְי י ֵד ְס ַח) are said to be new every morning (םי ִשׁ ָד ֲח 
םי ִר ָק ְבּ ַל).  
8  See, e.g., a summary of Joseph Ziegler’s article on the topic (“Die Hilfe Gottes ‘am Morgen’,” in 
Alttestamentliche  Studien  Friedrich  Nötscher  zum  60.  Geburtstag  gewidmet [ed. Hubert  Junker  and 
Johannes Botterweck; Bonner Biblische Beiträge 1; Bonn: Peter Hanstein Verlag, 1950], 281–88) 
with criticisms of his proposal in Ch. Barth, “ר ֶקֹבּ bōqer,” TDOT 2:226–28.

TRANSLATION: 

 

1. I will praise the lord of wisdom, the circumspect god, 
2. Angry at night (but) relenting at daybreak. 
3. Marduk, the lord of wisdom, the circumspect god, 
4. Angry at night (but) relenting at daybreak. 
5. Whose fury, like a violent storm, is a wasteland, 
6. But whose blowing, like a breeze of the morning hours, is pleasant. 
7. (Who) in his anger is irresistible, his fury a flood, 
8. (But) his heart is merciful, his mood relenting. 
9. The brunt of whose hand the heavens cannot bear, 
10. (But) whose palm is (so) gentle it aids the dying.   
11. Marduk, the brunt of whose hand the heavens cannot bear, 
12. (But) whose palm is so gentle it aids the dying. 
13. On account of whose wrath, graves are opened, 
14. At that time he raises up the fallen from catastrophe. 
15. He frowns: the divine guardian and protective spirit withdraw.   
16. He takes notice: his god turns back to him whom he had rejected. 
17. His grievous punishment is immediately overbearing, 
18. He shows pity and instantly becomes motherly. 
19. He hastens to treat his beloved kindly, 
20. And like a cow with a calf, he is ever attentive. 
21. His beatings are barbed, they pierce the body, 
22.  (But)  his  bandages  mollify,  they  restore  (the  one  afflicted  by)  the  Namtar-

 

demon. 

23. He speaks, and he imputes sin, 
24. (But) on his day of justice liability and guilt are absolved. 
25. He makes (one) acquire the demon shivering,  
26. (But) with his incantation he expels chills and cold tremors. 
27. Who makes slight(?) the flood(?) of Adad, the blow of Erra, 
28. (But) who reconciles (one’s) enraged god and goddess. 
29. The Lord, he sees everything in the heart of the gods, 
30. (But) no one among the gods knows his way.  
31. Marduk, he sees everything in the heart of the gods, 
32. (But) no god can learn his counsel. 
33. As heavy as is his hand, his heart is merciful. 
34. As murderous as are his weapons, his intention is life-sustaining. 
35. Without his consent, who may assuage his striking? 
36. Apart from his intention, who may stay his hand? 
37. I, who ate mud like a fish, will extol his anger. 
38. He quickly bestowed favor on me, just as he restored the dead. 
39. I will teach the people that their plea for favor is near. 
40. May his sympathetic concern carry off their sin.

There are few resources for students of the Bible who wish to 
work with ancient Near Eastern textual materials in the original 
languages  but  have  only  an  intermediate  level  of  linguistic 
aptitude.  The  field  needs  something  that  offers  glosses  on 
vocabulary, grammatical notes, basic literary commentary, and 
comparative suggestions about how the text connects to biblical 
material. This book provides such a tool for a body of material 
that has long occupied comparatively inclined biblical scholars. 
The  introduction  gives  a  panoramic  overview  of  Akkadian 
prayers  and  hymns,  their  cultural  and  literary  background, 
and  the  history  of  modern  scholarship’s  use  of  these  texts 
for  understanding  the  Hebrew  Bible,  and  the  volume  offers 
extensive linguistic, literary, and cultural commentary for the 
hymns and prayers in a line-by-line manner.
