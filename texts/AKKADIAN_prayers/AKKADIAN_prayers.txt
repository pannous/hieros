viAcknowledgments
Several people deserve a word of thanks for their role in the production of
this book. I first and foremost want to thank all of the contributors for signing
on to this project and working hard to bring it to completion. Among the con-
tributors, I especially wish to thank Christopher Frechette, Duane Smith, and
Anna Zernecke. Christopher was a constant source of information, conversation,
and encouragement. This book has greatly benefited from his sage advice and
scholarly knowledge. Duane lent his programming expertise to the project, mak-
ing the transformation of Unicode to cuneiform as painless as one could hope.
He saved me many, many hours of tedious work. Anna graciously took on the
review of biblical scholarship for the general introduction rather late in the pro-
ject, allowing me extra time to focus on editorial tasks. That section is no doubt
the better for her having written it. I also wish to extend my heartfelt apprecia-
tion to several people, including some of the above, who read drafts of my con-
tributions to this volume and offered their suggestions and critical feedback:
Tzvi Abusch, Jeffrey Cooley, Christopher Frechette, Eugene McGarry, Seth Sand-
ers, Duane Smith, and Niek Veldhuis. When I did not follow their suggestions, I
did so only after much deliberation, in full knowledge that I alone must take
responsibility for my work. Monica Schutzman and the Interlibrary Loan staff at
University of the Pacific were a tremendous support throughout the duration of
this project. Getting obscure Assyriological works into the Central Valley is their
speciality. Leigh Andersen from the Society of Biblical Literature editorial staff
was a patient guide as I laid out the complicated pages of this volume. And final-
ly, I wish to thank my family for allowing me to work ridiculous hours every day
of the week during the final months of this project. They are always a source of
comfort, joy, and diversion.

viiAbout This Book
A LAN L ENZI
This book is a pedagogical tool intended to increase reading fluency for sec-
ond or third semester Akkadian students by way of annotated readings. It is
equally an introduction to Akkadian prayers and hymns from ancient Mesopo-
tamia: selected classes, their vocabulary and phraseology, and to some extent
their ritual uses. Finally, the introductory material in this book exposes readers
to theoretical and critical perspectives that will be useful in the study of other
ancient religious texts. More advanced students of Akkadian may therefore find
something profitable here as well.
The idea for this book was inspired by tools developed in Biblical and Clas-
sical Studies in which lexical and grammatical help is printed on the same page
as the ancient text to be read. 1 This arrangement cuts out the time-consuming
process of looking up words and allows the intermediate student to cement their
basic grammatical knowledge and expand their vocabulary through extensive
reading. There is currently nothing like this available for Akkadian.
As many students will attest, academic books are often quite expensive, tak-
ing important tools out of the reach of economically-challenged students and/or
those who may be without access to a well-stocked academic research library. It
is gratifying therefore to make this volume available free of charge through the
SBL’s electronic open-access Ancient Near East Monograph series. If the reader
finds this tool useful, please feel free to share it with others.
Because prayers and hymns—but especially prayers—display stereotyped
forms and utilize a manageable core of vocabulary, selecting texts from this
body of material seemed a perfect choice for this kind of book. But selecting
prayers and hymns also serves educational interests beyond Akkadian fluency
for the book’s targeted audiences. For Assyriological students, learning the forms
and vocabulary of prayers and hymns as well as something about the addressees

University Press, 2007); Ehud Ben Zvi, Maxine Hancock, and Richard A. Beinert, Readings in
Biblical Hebrew: An Intermediate Textbook (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993); and Richard
J. Goodrich and David Diewert, A Summer Greek Reader: A Workbook for Maintaining Your Biblical
Greek (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2001).
ixxof such is an important step toward gaining a broad familiarity with the Akkadi-
an religious textual corpus. The contents and format of this book will facilitate
acquiring that familiarity with relative ease, preparing them for advanced study.
Although Classicists are increasingly taking an interest in Akkadian, the majority
of non-Assyriological students who study Akkadian comes from the ranks of bib-
lical scholarship. As there is a long history of interaction between Assyriology
and Biblical Studies in the matter of prayers and hymns, selecting texts from this
corpus again seemed to serve an important segment of Akkadian students. It is
hoped that this volume will fill a gap in the available resources to these Akkadi-
an students and spur other scholars on to produce similar pedagogical materials
for different genres, especially historical inscriptions.
T HE S ELECTION OF T EXTS IN THIS V OLUME :
There are a great many texts one might choose to include in a volume of
Akkadian prayers and hymns. We have made our very limited selection accord-
ing to a few guiding principles.
1. Texts included in this volume represent several different kinds of Akkadian pray-
ers. Not every category of prayer is represented, but a good variety is of-
fered. Due to the great number of extant shuilla- and incantation-prayers as
well as their importance in both Assyriological research and the compara-
tive work of biblical scholars, we have included a very generous selection
from these categories. As hymns are not nearly as numerous and those pre-
served are often quite long (e.g., two hundred lines), only a couple of sam-
ples have been included. But as one will see, most prayers contain a hymnic
element. So even when reading a prayer, one frequently will gain some ex-
posure to the language of praise as well.
2. Texts included in this volume reflect a wide variety of addressees. We have in-
cluded prayers to most of the high gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon (En-
lil, Ashur, and Ninurta are obvious omissions) as well as examples of pray-
ers to personal gods, familial ghosts, and materials used in the cult. Some
deities are very richly represented among extant prayers (e.g., Shamash, Ish-
tar, and Marduk). We have reflected this popularity by including several
prayers addressed to these gods.
3. Texts included in this volume have a suitable modern edition available. The
treatments offered in this volume do not produce a new critical edition of
the prayer or hymn under study. That epigraphic and text critical work has
been done, freeing contributors to focus on helping students understand the
grammar and meaning of the texts. Satisfying the first two criteria above,
however, took precedence over this criterion. There are a few cases there-
fore in which contributors were forced to use a dated edition (e.g., from Er-
ich Ebeling’s Die akkadische Gebetsserie “Handerhebung.” Von neuem gesam-A BOUT T HIS B OOK
xi
melt und herausgegeben (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1953; abbreviated, Ebe-
ling, AGH). 2
4. Texts included in this volume have accessible modern translations available. Alt-
hough each treatment includes a fresh translation, choosing to treat previ-
ously translated texts ensured that each text would be relatively well-
understood. This gave contributors conversation partners in their annota-
tions and offers students more resources for in-depth study.
5. Texts included in this volume are written in either the Old Babylonian (OB) or
Standard Babylonian (SB) dialects of the Akkadian language. Prayers and
hymns are preserved in various Akkadian dialects. But most students begin
learning Akkadian with the OB dialect and then progress to SB. It seemed
pedagogically appropriate therefore to include prayers in these two dialects
(as opposed to also including some in Assyrian or peripheral dialects). As
the greatest number of prayers and hymns are preserved in SB and most
second year Akkadian students will be ready to read these, the SB prayers
comprise the majority of texts treated in this volume.
T HE C ONTENTS OF E ACH T EXTUAL T REATMENT :
Each textual treatment in this volume is self-contained. A student can begin
reading with text no. 13 (𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹), for example, and have all the information neces-
sary within the treatment to read and understand that text. 3 This feature allows
students to read the prayers in any order; it also gives professors the flexibility
to assign any sub-set of prayers in the volume without concern that the student
will be missing something assumed from an earlier textual treatment. Although
this manner of presentation results in significant overlap and repetition, this is
pedagogically beneficial. Seeing the meanings of the same word over and over
will help a student lock it into their memory. As the student’s reading fluency
increases, they can easily pass over glosses and annotations that are no longer
necessary to them. Each treatment includes the following sections:
An introduction to the deity/entity addressed or praised
An introduction to the prayer
The text of the prayer or hymn in transliteration
Notes on the text, including a normalization
Comparative suggestions
A translation in English
The text of the prayer in a cuneiform font
2
One of the most pressing desiderata in Assyriological research related to prayers is a compre-
hensive edition of all of the known Akkadian shuillas.
Cross-referencing between treatments is limited, generally reserved for major issues or refer-
ence to deities.
3xiiDeity. Each treatment begins with a succinct introduction to the entity ad-
dressed or praised in the text. In most cases, this means an introduction to a
deity. But in a few treatments, the addressee is undetermined (see the Prayer to
Any God on page 447) or not a deity (as in the prayers to familial ghosts, see
page 133, and salt, page 189). These introductions attempt to give something
more than what one finds in Jeremy Black’s and Anthony Green’s useful book,
Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia, 4 but less than the very rich
and technical entries in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie (RlA). Although the con-
tent of the introductions varies, the ones concerned with deities usually include
a discussion of the deity’s sphere of power, their position in the pantheon, their
original city, the locations of their major temples, their relationships to other
deities, their iconographic and astrological representations, and their divine
number. The purpose of this section is to help the reader gain some familiarity
with the deity so as to understand the broader context of the prayer. The reader
who works through this book will have substantially enriched their knowledge
of a variety of non-obvious beings from ancient Mesopotamia.
The Prayer. The second section of each treatment gives an introduction to
the prayer or hymn under consideration. In the case of many SB prayers, these
texts are identified by the name of the deity invoked followed by a number (e.g.,
Shamash 1 or Nusku 12). This identification convention follows Werner Mayer’s
catalog of incantation-prayers in his important work Untersuchungen zur Formen-
sprache der babylonischen „Gebetsbeschwörungen “ (abbreviated, Mayer, UFBG). 5
Although one might expect these introductions to vary due to each text’s indi-
vidual character, genre, or availability of data, they also vary due to the differ-
ent interests of the contributing authors. Some contributors give more attention
to the ritual uses of the particular text under discussion while others prefer to
exposit the text’s literary features and themes. This diversity of approach will
benefit the reader by illustrating the diverse results various analytical and inter-
pretive methods can produce. The one common denominator in all of the treat-
ments is the identification of the structure of the prayer, that is, how it “works”
rhetorically.
Essential Bibliography. After the two introductions, each treatment in-
cludes an essential bibliography for both the deity and the text treated. The full
citation for works cited by author or by author and short title in the footnotes to
the introductions will be found here. In the case of prayers and hymns, the bib-
liography includes references to the most recent edition, several translations,
and an important work or two that has discussed the text at some length—if
available. As the title of the section indicates, this is only essential bibliography
as judged by the contributors and the editor. It is not exhaustive.

Edition: Knowing the edition upon which the treatment’s text is based was
considered essential. Full publication information for each witness to or manu-
script ( MS ) of the text was not deemed essential. Usually, one can consult the
text’s most recent edition to learn the identity of the various manuscripts ( MSS ,
that is, tablets) that attest the text. And this will tell the reader where the tablets
are housed and assist them in locating the pertinent hand copies or photos for
further study. Generally, only in cases where the edition is very dated (e.g.,
when the only edition is in Ebeling’s AGH) or is in press (e.g., the shuilla to
Nisaba) has information about the tablets and/or their copies been included in
the bibliography or its footnotes. Consulting tablets (deciphering or collating
actual tablets and reading from photos or hand copies of tablets) is a very im-
portant part of Assyriological research and therefore an essential element of As-
syriological training. The present volume, however, is not intended to be a
handbook on cuneiform epigraphy or a manual on how to produce a critical
edition. It is a tool to facilitate more fluent reading in Akkadian religious texts.
For readers who want to learn more about the textual basis for an individual
prayer, the best place to start is the most recently published critical edition.
Translations: References to the translations by Foster (English), Seux
(French), and Falkenstein/von Soden (German), when available, are included
among the essential bibliography, although contributors may choose to add oth-
ers. Reference to these translators is made by way of their last name alone. Fos-
ter’s translations may be found in Benjamin R. Foster, Before the Muses: An An-
thology of Akkadian Literature (3d ed.; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2005); Seux’s are in
Marie-Joseph Seux, Hymnes et Prieres aux Dieux de Babylonie et d’Assyrie (Paris:
Les Éditions de Cerf, 1976); and von Soden’s (in one of our prayers, Falken-
stein’s) are in Adam Falkenstein and Wolfram von Soden, Sumerische und akka-
dische Hymnen und Gebete (Die Bibliothek der Alten Welt; Stuttgart: Artemis-
Verlag Zürich, 1953), 233–407. For students interested in digging deeper into
the text of a prayer or hymn, these translations, especially Foster and Seux, are a
treasure trove of useful information, often offering different understandings of
the text, pointing to further bibliography, and sometimes including new witness-
es discovered since the production of the text’s critical edition.
The Text in Transliteration. Anyone wishing to utilize Akkadian in their
research will encounter the language in transliteration, that is, in a sign for sign
system of notation using Latin letters and various diacritical marks. The center
piece of each treatment therefore is the text of the prayer or the hymn in trans-
literation. The text is printed a few lines at a time at the top of the page.
The text utilized in each treatment generally follows the reconstruction of
the most recent critical edition with one major exception: in order to avoid over-
loading the student’s eye with epigraphic technicalities, half-brackets in the edi-
tions were ignored. Moreover, no textual apparatus is included and there has been
no attempt to provide in the notes a comprehensive discussion of all of the vari-
ants in all of the MSS of each prayer or hymn. Such would have transformed this
work into something quite different. Occasionally, a departure from the critical
edition’s reconstructed text is identified in a note at the foot of the page. Depar-xivtures may be something as simple as selecting a variant reading rather than the
one preferred by the critical edition because the variant provided a pedagogical-
ly advantageous text. For example, the edition may have selected the harder
reading (lectio difficilior) when deciding between variants whereas the contribu-
tor to this volume preferred the one best suited to a pedagogical context. In oth-
er cases, the critical edition required the contributors to make a decision about
which lines to include and which lines to exclude. For example, various MSS of a
prayer may preserve a self-introduction formula at different places in the prayer
or one MS may insert an attalû-formula while others lack it. If the critical edition
did not reconstruct an “original” text (as, e.g., in the editions for Sin 1 and the
Universal Namburbi), the contributors had to make decisions about what would
be used in their treatment and what would be excluded. It must be emphasized
therefore that the texts used in this edition are no substitute for the consultation and
careful study of a modern critical edition and the individual witnesses that preserve
the text. For readers who want to understand the textual diversity of a given
prayer or take their study of its text to an advanced level, they absolutely must
consult the text’s modern critical edition.
A word should also be said here about the use of sequential line numbering
in the presentation of the texts. Critical editions may reconstruct line numbers
based on what the editor has chosen as the primary textual witness (usually
dubbed MS A). This, for example, was the procedure used by Werner Mayer in
the selection of prayers he edited at the back of UFBG (439–541). In other cases,
the editor contrives a system of line numbering that makes the best sense of the
preserved, perhaps fragmentary witnesses and allows for designating what the
editor deems secondary. When variant lines occur, they are given number-letter
designations (e.g., 7a and 7b would occur after line 7 of the main text) or simply
placed in a footnote. The potential for confusion in this diversity of methods in
text editions is compounded by the fact that some texts are part of a larger, mul-
ti-tablet work. For example, the prayers to salt and to Girra included in this vol-
ume come from the eight-tablet, anti-witchcraft series called Maqlû, “burning,”
and the hymn to Marduk comes from the four-tablet poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi. The
texts of these prayers are properly referenced by the tablet in which the text
occurs and then the line number on that tablet (e.g., I 1–40, which means Tablet
I, lines 1 through 40).
For pedagogical purposes, a simplified consistent numbering method was
decided upon. Throughout the volume, each treatment begins with line number
1 and proceeds sequentially to the text’s end, even when the critical edition or
the position of the text in a multi-tablet series indicated otherwise. There is only
one exception to this practice. In the Universal Namburbi, there is a gap (due to
a tablet break) of undetermined length in the middle of the text (see page 412).
When the text resumes, the line numbering in this treatment begins with 1ʹ. As
is standard in Assyriological literature, the prime marker (ʹ) indicates that the
absolute line numbering cannot be determined due to a lack of evidence among
the witnesses (because of a break on a tablet).A BOUT T HIS B OOK

Annotations. At the foot of the page are brief notes on each line of Akkadi-
an text. Every logogram in the text is given its Akkadian equivalent and the first
occurrence of each word in the prayer or hymn is defined briefly. 6 At the discre-
tion of the contributor, grammatical and syntactical help is provided for difficult
forms or complex sentences. In many notes, the contributor also offers brief
commentary that may highlight a literary feature, a ritual gesture, and/or a
broader textual, linguistic, or cultural item suggested by the text. At the end of
each note the text of the Akkadian line is given again in normalized Akkadian,
that is, in a Latin-character transcription that approximates how the language
would have sounded in ancient times. This normalization is intended to help
clarify the grammar of the line.
Assyriologists have differing ideas about how to normalize an Akkadian sen-
tence. Even the dictionaries disagree sometimes about the normalization of indi-
vidual words (e.g., they often disagree about vowel length and doubled conso-
nants). For consistency’s sake, contributors were asked to follow John
Huehnergard’s system of normalization as practiced in his popular pedagogical
grammar, A Grammar of Akkadian, 2d ed., 7 and the normalization of words ac-
cording to the handbook dictionary most students will use in their early studies:
A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian (CDA, 8 based on von Soden’s AHw 9 ). But there
is an important caveat with regard to the latter’s use. Unlike the CDA, which
always gives the lemma in OB form, the glossed words and normalized lines of
text in this volume always use OB forms in OB texts and SB forms in SB texts
(e.g., amātu instead of awātum in SB texts). An alternate normalization or the OB
form is sometimes given alongside an Akkadian word that is glossed in the
notes. The alternates are given in order to facilitate looking these words up in
the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) 10 —the indispensible reference lexicon of
the Akkadian language—or the OB-based CDA. After gaining some familiarity
with the basic sound changes from OB to SB Akkadian (see Huehnergard’s Ap-
pendix D) and some practice, navigating through these minor differences and
disagreements among the dictionaries will be no trouble.
Another point about normalization requires our brief attention. SB Akkadian
shows more freedom in the use of case-endings (final vowels) on substantives
6
Given the multiple contributors to the volume and the varied contexts in which words are
used, the editor has not attempted a thorough standardization of the meanings of words that
recur frequently.

Sippar, and Uruk) show even more freedom—some might say disarray—in this
respect. Normalizations in this volume have not forced these texts to conform to
OB grammatical expectations. The case ending in the text at the top of the page
is also adopted in the normalization in the notes. If the tablet reads a genitive
where one expects an accusative, the normalization will show the genitive. The
contributors often alert the student to these instances in their grammatical
comments.
Comparative Suggestions. Comparativism may have fallen out of style in
many fields (due to Postmodernism’s particularism and the many pitfalls inher-
ent in comparative practices) but it continues unabated among Akkadian-
reading biblical scholars. 11 Given the series and publisher of the present volume,
it seemed appropriate to include in each treatment a section in which the con-
tributor offers ideas about how the Akkadian prayer might tie in to biblical liter-
ature on a linguistic, thematic, or cultural (including religious) level. Assyriolog-
ical students may not be interested in this section. It is easily skipped. Biblical
students may wish for more. That is often facilitated by references to the biblical
text and/or secondary literature. It should be emphasized that contributors were
instructed to offer only brief suggestions not fully developed arguments, which
could easily—but were not allowed to—over-shadow the entire treatment.
Translation. The translations offered for each text in this volume tend to-
ward the literal side of the translation spectrum. They are not intended to be
polished, literary renderings. A literal-tending translation gives the reader one
more layer of help to understand the Akkadian grammar. As the reader advances
in their knowledge of Akkadian, their translations should progress toward a
more sophisticated translation technique. In fact, we encourage readers to re-
work the translations offered here in light of their own interpretive decisions
and as their Akkadian fluency increases. 12

Press, 2000).

A brief note about inclusive language: Throughout the prayers, the supplicant is referred to in
Akkadian with masculine singular pronouns. Although in some cases, it is clear that the suppli-
cant is a man, there is no conclusive evidence known to me that the supplicant in all prayers was
always male. Since the masculine grammatical gender was the default gender and since it seems
unlikely to me that women never prayed or needed the services of an exorcist, it seems reasona-
ble to believe women prayed other prayers besides those dealing with specifically women’s is-
sues (e.g., Ishtar 28 and 29). Rather than cluttering up the text with “he or she” or “her/him,”
etc. when referring to the supplicant, I have advised contributors to use the pronouns “they,
them, their, theirs.” For justification of using a third person plural pronoun as a gender neutral
third person singular pronoun, see the online dictionary maintained by Oxford University Press
at this address: http://oxforddictionaries.com/page/384 (accessed last, March 12, 2011). On theA BOUT T HIS B OOK

Cuneiform. At the end of each treatment the Akkadian text is presented in
a Unicode cuneiform font. Unlike the sophisticated shading of signs in the most
recent volumes of the State Archives of Assyria Cuneiform Text (SAACT) series,
there is no indication of restored or broken signs. The available Unicode fonts
did not allow this kind of precision. Moreover, in some cases, the signs are not
quite perfectly shaped. The cuneiform is given here simply so readers can prac-
tice their knowledge of the script. This neat, uniform presentation of the text in
cuneiform is, of course, no substitute for reading from hand copies, photos of
tablets, and eventually the tablets themselves. The reality on the tablets is much
messier and, on first glance at least, more chaotic than anything a handbook can
teach.
The font used for OB texts, Santakku, is based on the OB cursive sign list.
The SB font is called Assurbanipal, based on the Neo-Assyrian inventory of signs.
Both fonts were created by Sylvie Vanséveren at the Université Libre de Brux-
elles. 13 Students wishing to work from the cuneiform are encouraged to print out
a hardcopy of the pages containing this section and use it in tandem with the
transliteration and notes.
other hand, and despite the inconsistency, we have not rendered māru, “son,” in an inclusive
manner when it appears in the phrase annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so.”

A LAN L ENZI , C HRISTOPHER F RECHETTE , AND A NNA E LISE Z ERNECKE *
Interpreting textual remains from an ancient culture requires a reader to
develop multiple competencies that will both situate the textual material in its
original context and translate this material to the contemporary sphere in a
manner that is authentic yet understandable. The interpreter of ancient texts
requires more than a strong knowledge of the language used in the texts; they
also need a theoretical interpretive framework suitable to the material at hand, a
broad understanding of the historical, cultural, and textual issues surrounding
the documents, and a literary competence in the specific genres to which the
texts belong. Religious texts from ancient Mesopotamia present an array of chal-
lenges with regard to the acquisition of these intellectual tools, challenges which
are compounded by the fact that the texts are often utilized in a comparative
fashion. This introductory chapter is intended to help the reader of Akkadian
prayers and hymns begin working through these complex issues and developing
the multiple competencies required to interpret ancient prayers and hymns well.
First, this introduction sets out a general interpretive framework for defin-
ing and understanding prayer and praise within the various human activities we
deem religious. Although space will not permit a full discussion of all the com-
plexities involved, issues surrounding the definition of religion, the academic
study of religion in a post-Enlightenment Western intellectual milieu, and the
multi-faceted character of prayer and praise will receive some attention. The
goal in this section, although apparently distant from Akkadian prayers and
hymns, is to familiarize the reader with some broad trends in Religious Studies
so as to sharpen their interpretive approach to the Akkadian materials.
Second, turning to ancient Mesopotamia, this introduction provides a gen-
eral discussion of the definition of prayer and to some extent praise as they are
applied to ancient Mesopotamian texts in order to fine tune these definitions to
the Akkadian material. This inevitably brings up the thorny issue of how modern
*
Although throughout the writing of this introduction we have enjoyed several collegial con-
versations and offered one another constructive criticism of the other’s material, each scholar is
responsible for their section(s) alone: Frechette for the shuilla-prayer discussion, Zernecke for the
comparative discussion, and Lenzi for the remaining parts.
12scholarly categorizations relate (or should relate) to the ancient scribal classifi-
catory labels that were applied to the texts. The position adopted here is that the
modern imposition of conceptual categories and definitions upon ancient texts is
inevitable and can be quite useful for the modern scholar; however, one must
also be ever vigilant to reflect upon the relationship between the modern and
ancient manner of classifying texts lest one conflate one’s own categories with
those of the Mesopotamians and distort the material being interpreted.
Third, having explored the parameters of Akkadian prayer and praise in a
general manner, the focus narrows to descriptions of the most important kinds of
Akkadian texts scholars have usually classified as prayers. The goal in this sec-
tion is to provide useful overviews along with essential bibliographical assis-
tance that will help the reader understand the specific prayers included in this
volume (and others they may read outside of this volume) within the context of
prayers of the same class.
Finally, a brief survey of the use of Akkadian prayers in biblical scholarship
concludes the introductory material. Akkadian prayers and hymns have a long
history of comparative use, full of pitfalls, missteps, but also insights. This sec-
tion informs the reader of the history of scholarship and offers suggestions for
the way ahead.
Due to the length and varied content of the introduction, one might find it
most useful to read the first two sections before reading any Akkadian texts and
then return to the relevant part of the third section when one begins to read a
prayer from a particular class. The fourth section may be read independently.
P RAYERS AND H YMNS IN A R ELIGIOUS S TUDIES P ERSPECTIVE :
The various characteristics that comprise what is called “prayer” and
“hymn” are commonly understood by contemporary people as falling within the
conceptual domain of religion, a term readily understood when used in everyday
conversation. Though a tacit definition of religion may be useful—indeed, neces-
sary—in everyday life, it repays the careful student of another culture (and
time!) to reflect upon issues surrounding the definition of religion, lest one im-
pose one’s own parochial understanding of religion on the culture under study in
a prejudicial and/or uncritical manner. Of course, defining religion is rather
complex and raises more issues than can be covered, let alone solved here. The
following reflections therefore remain general and are only intended to intro-
duce the philological student to some issues and contemporary literature that
may contribute to the development of a general interpretive framework for Mes-
opotamian religious texts, especially prayers and hymns.
Like other abstract terms used in the social sciences—terms such as art, lit-
erature, or history—religion is not easily defined. 1 Unlike objective entities such

as a book, a desk, or a tablet, scholars cannot simply point to the thing / concept
“religion” and thereby make the referent of the term more or less clear to all
with whom they would communicate. Scholars therefore must devise a technical
definition. As one might imagine, there are no shortages of these in the litera-
ture. Classic theorists often looked to the supposed content of religion (substan-
tivist definitions) or what religion putatively does (functionalist definitions) for
help. 2 Attempts to define religion substantively may isolate one essential feature
(an essentialist definition) that really captures the essence of religion (e.g., Fra-
zer thought belief in divine beings was the essential ingredient) or may enumer-
ate a series of family resemblances a number of which every example of religion
will have. Attempts to define religion functionally tend to look for what religion
does for/to its adherents: it provides psychological comfort (Freud), creates so-
cial solidarity (Durkheim), formulates “a general order of existence” that estab-
lishes “uniquely realistic” “moods and motivations” via a “system of symbols”
(Geertz), 3 or creates a “false consciousness” (an ideology) that veils the true na-
ture of economic exploitation of the masses by the owners of the means of pro-
duction (Marx). Functionalist definitions may also take an essentialist approach,
arguing that one function really explains what religion does and thereby cap-
tures its true nature or essence.
Both approaches have had their problems and detractors. Substantivist defi-
nitions might evoke accusations of prejudice, political bias, arbitrariness, or cir-
cularity. One might easily ask why a belief (intellectual assent) should define
religion instead of, for example, a set of behaviors, or why a majority of broad
features found in the (assumed) major world religions today should define reli-
gion universally (and from the past). 4 Even as functionalist definitions provide
insight into those activities deemed religious, they run the risk of being applied
in a metaphysically reductionistic manner; that is, they may explain religion
defining and the actual definition of religion: William Arnal, “Definition,” in A Guide to the Study
of Religion (ed. Willi Braun and Russell T. McCutcheon; London and New York: Cassell, 2000),
21–34; Bruce Lincoln’s chapter entitled “The Study of Religion in the Current Political Moment”
in Holy Terrors: Thinking about Religion after September 11 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
2003; 2d ed., 2006), 1–8; Melford E. Spiro, “Religion: Problems of Definition and Explanation,”
in Culture and Human Nature: Theoretical Papers of Melford E. Spiro (ed. Benjamin Kilborne and L.
L. Langness; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), 187–98, and Jonathan Z. Smith, “Reli-
gion, Religions, Religious,” in Critical Terms for Religious Studies (ed. Mark C. Taylor; Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1998), 269–84.
2
For a treatment of a number of classic theorists of religion, see Daniel Pals, Eight Theories of
Religion (2d ed.; New York: Oxford University Press, 2006).
3
See Clifford Geertz, Interpretation of Cultures (New York: Basic Books, 1973), 90 and 91–123 for
his elaboration.
4
For criticisms of the former, see Talal Asad, Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of
Power in Christianity and Islam (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993); for issues
surrounding the latter, see Jonathan Z. Smith, “Classification,” 41–43 in Guide to the Study of
Religion.4away as nothing but psychology, sociology, biology, etc. 5 Or, functionalist defi-
nitions may fail to clarify how their proposed understanding of religion identi-
fies a distinctive subset of human activity. Watching a football game or attend-
ing a rock concert can create social solidarity. Are these examples of religion?
Finally, in as much as substantivist and functionalist definitions attempt to cir-
cumscribe the genuine essence of a “transhistorical and transcultural phenome-
non,” they may reflect a kind of epistemological idealism and/or conceal an
implicit theological assumption on the part of their wielder. 6
Given these problems and pitfalls of defining the concept, some scholars re-
fuse to define religion at all and content themselves with deconstructing what
people might mean by the term. 7 Others, such as Jonathan Z. Smith, have ar-
gued that scholars simply ought to recognize that religion as such does not actu-
ally, objectively exist in space and time but can be understood as something
constructed by scholars and wielded usefully as an analytical category for under-
standing cultural data (i.e., observable human activities and the products there-
of). 8 In this case, the ideas and perspectives offered by substantivist and func-
tionalist definitions, without their absolutist claims, may be incorporated into
this approach in an eclectic manner, if such ideas and perspectives are deemed
useful for the scholar’s purposes. This latter option is adopted here.
Before deciding how to construct this category called religion, it is im-
portant to note that the recognition of “religion” and its continued use among
scholars as a useful category for understanding human culture are the product of
a specific confluence of historical circumstances in the West, especially the Eu-
ropean Enlightenment. 9 This need not negate religion’s analytical usefulness,
since every concept is a product of some place and time and has a history. 10
5
It is well-known, e.g., that Durkheim, Freud, and Marx, all three major figures in functionalist
approaches to religion, were ardent atheists and believed their theories explained transcendental
religious claims away. For the important distinction between metaphysical and methodological
(see below) reductionism, see Russel T. McCutcheon, Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public
Study of Religion (Issues in the Study of Religion; Albany: State University of New York, 2001), x–
xi.
6
“Transhistorical and transcultural phenomenon” are the words of Talal Asad, quoted in Arnal,
“Definition,” 30. The work of Mircea Eliade, an important and popular twentieth century histori-
an of religion, is often criticized for its implicit theological assumption (see, e.g., Pals, Eight The-
ories of Religion, 223).
7
This is Arnal’s preference (“Definition,” 30). See also Timothy Fitzgerald’s provocative The
Ideology of Religious Studies (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000).
8
Jonathan Z. Smith, Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago Studies in the Histo-
ry of Judaism; Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1982), xi. Human claims about
the gods and their actions, for example, are observable and therefore count as data.
9
This is argued forcefully by Talal Asad, Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power
in Christianity and Islam (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), especially 27–
54, who dismantles Geertz’s once dominant definition of religion. For details about the struggle
of the philosophes against Christianity, see, e.g., Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation,
vol. 1, The Rise of Modern Paganism (New York: Knopf, 1967).
10
See Lincoln, Holy Terrors, 2, who counters Asad in this manner.I NTRODUCTION
5
Moreover, without some kind of categorization, one simply cannot begin any
intellectual undertaking—how would one know what to look for? 11 But it is
worth considering that our analytical awareness to mark religion out as a dis-
tinct element in culture is the result of historical struggles in which the cultural
hegemony of specific institutions in Europe, notably the churches, receded and
made room for secular cultural institutions and activities. In a rather unusual
turn of cultural events, that which is called religion in the West lost its unques-
tioned position of primacy in the public sphere (e.g., the separation of Church
and State was only thinkable in a post-Enlightenment context) and has largely
retreated to the private sector. 12 The recognition of this contemporary cultural
context should urge caution when approaching a non-Western, non-modern cul-
ture such as ancient Mesopotamia, where one might reasonably ask, in light of
our modern situation and definition offered below, “What is not religious in
Mesopotamia?” 13
The purpose of providing a definition in this introduction is to create a use-
ful heuristic mechanism, a filter that serves our descriptive and interpretive pur-
poses by identifying a subset of human cultural activity as religious. 14 Due to the
limits of time, skills, technology, interests, observable data, and perhaps our
inability to see beyond our own prejudices, defining religion in this mode will be
limited and limiting in its scope. In other words, this understanding of definition
is methodologically reductionistic. Methodological reductionism, according to
McCutcheon, means one’s definitional stance is prefaced as follows: “given my
methods/theories, the discursive rules of our institution, and my particular set of

See Jonathan Z. Smith, “Classification,” 43, where he concludes his essay with this statement:
“the rejection of classificatory interest is, at the same time, a rejection of thought.”
12
These statements are not intended to negate the fact that religious people and groups continue
to have a substantial impact on the public sphere. They clearly do. But their influence in, e.g.,
the United States, is not due to a State-sanctioned, privileged position. Even in some places
where a Christian church does have state sanction, reason seems to have trumped revelation on a
large scale. See Paul Zuckerman, Society Without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us
About Contentment (Albany: New York University Press, 2008).

See Niek Veldhuis’s comments in his book Religion, Literature, and Scholarship: The Sumerian
Composition Nanše and the Birds, with a catalogue of Sumerian bird names (Cuneiform Monographs
22; Leiden/Boston: Styx/Brill, 2004), 11–13. Bruce Lincoln’s essay “Culture” in A Guide to the
Study of Religion (ed. Willi Braun and Russell T. McCutcheon; London and New York: Cassell,
2000), 409–22 provides a useful model for thinking about culture. Culture, according to Lincoln,
may be considered to be composed of two major domains of human preferences: ethics (what is
good) and aesthetics (what is pleasing). These two domains are always present in culture. Reli-
gion, as he defines it (see below), is a third, potential component that does not offer unique
content (for ethics and aesthetics subsume all cultural content) but authorizes particular ethical
and aesthetic preferences in a way that gives them supra-human or transcendent authority. In
some cultures, religion plays this role minimally, affecting relatively few or only private prefer-
ences; in others, it has maximal effect, touching nearly every ethical and aesthetic preference a
person holds. Mesopotamian cultures, according to this model, would fall on the “maximal” side
of the spectrum.
14
The same caveat applies to the definitions of “prayer” and “hymn” developed below, which
should not be understood as natural categories but constructs used for analytical purposes.6interests and curiosities, religion turns out to be. . . .” 15 Moreover, such a defini-
tion should be held as provisional, a starting point; it should undergo refinement
and adjustment as new data are examined, the definition’s limitations explored,
and one’s interests and focus change.
Given the complexity of human activity in general, a multi-faceted or poly-
thetic definition of religion may be more useful than one that attempts to home
in on a single feature or two. Bruce Lincoln offers the following helpful perspec-
tive on the matter:
Briefly, I take religion to include four different components, which can re-
late to one another in various ways, including disjuncture and contradiction.
These components are:
1. A discourse that claims its concerns transcend the human, temporal and
contingent, while claiming for itself a similarly transcendent status.
2. A set of practices informed and structured by that discourse.
3. A community, whose members construct their identity with reference to
the discourse and its attendant practices.
4. An institution that regulates discourse, practices and community, repro-
ducing and modifying them over time, while asserting their eternal validity
and transcendent value. 16
Turning to prayers and hymns and how they fit into Lincoln’s definition of
religion, one might think they obviously and only belong to discourse. After all,
prayer, in everyday language, is simply a kind of religious or ritual speech that
communicates one’s concerns/petitions to a benevolent supra-human being via
words. Understood thus, prayer as a type of speech includes hymns, which con-
stitute a thematically more specific variety of prayer; namely, hymns communi-
cate praise (predominantly) by the same means. A prayer considered as dis-
course, alongside its primary and obvious purpose of communicating
information (one’s own, often worldly concerns and petitions) to the supra-
human addressee, also communicates something to any human who hears its
words, including the one praying. For prayers, as Sam Gill has stated, are often
“composed for the purpose of edifying, instructing, and influencing people in the
matters of dogma, belief, and tradition.” 17 Thus, prayers contain the petitions of
the supplicant but may also convey to people authoritatively “concerns [such as
theological truths, that] transcend the human, temporal and contingent.” Fur-
thermore, given the general sources from which one learns to pray (e.g., a scrip-
ture [Matt 6:5–13, Luke 11:1–13; Deut 6:4–9; Sura 1], an official prayerbook, a

priest of a god, an authoritative adult, a myth, and/or a normative tradition
handed down from the ancestors), it is not difficult to see how liturgical/ritual
prayer, even spontaneous prayer to the extent that it is shaped by an authorita-
tive model, 18 may at least implicitly claim “for itself a similarly transcendent
status.”
Related to this discourse perspective, one may also consider prayers and
hymns as a form of practice because the words spoken in a prayer have illocu-
tionary effects (i.e., they do things). The very act of uttering the words of a
hymn is to give honor, and the very act of directing words or petitions to a deity
is to seek assistance. But there is more to prayer/praise as practice than an act of
communication that may also give honor or seek assistance. In as much as ac-
tions (rituals, gestures, posture, comportment, etc.) are prescribed to accompany
the verbal act, prayers or hymns display other aspects of religious practice.
These actions, just like the forms of speech used in prayers, are historically and
culturally conditioned and may shed significant light on a prayer when consid-
ered alongside its other features.
Prayers as discourse/practice complexes are always spoken in a particular
social context, a community, which is implicitly or explicitly under the guidance
and (often but not always) authority of institutions (e.g., temples) and communi-
ty leaders (e.g., parents, priests, elders, a headman, etc.). 19 Considering the
communal and the institutional context of prayer helps one see its various as-
pects that extend beyond the individual supplicant. As noted earlier in the cita-
tion of Gill, when considering prayer as discourse, the wording of prayers often
contain more than the communication of one’s personal concerns; they may also
instruct and exhort others. “Such aspects of prayer,” Gill writes, “must be recog-
nized as important and often essential to the continuity and communication of
tradition and culture. In its capacity of performing these important functions,
the formulaic, repetitive, and standardized characteristics of prayer are effective
pedagogically and to enculturate.” 20 In other words, prayer as discourse and
practice is often institutionally prescribed or encouraged as a means of perpetu-
ating or reshaping, in times of liturgical reform, the community. When one
prays, one participates in a community and perpetuates its institutional values,
relevance, and power in society. To modify Donne’s famous line, no supplicant is
an island unto themselves.
Lincoln’s definition of religion brings into focus, therefore, how prayers are
more than texts. They are part and parcel of a whole network of social activities
that reflect and perpetuate the broader social formation that uses them. Failing
18
Note Gill’s generalization in this regard: “the record of personal prayers found in letters, biog-
raphies, and diaries suggests a strong correlation and interdependence of personal prayer with
ritual and liturgical prayer in language, form, style, and physical attitude” (ibid., 490).
19
Even the person praying spontaneously while completely alone will have had some communal
and institutional influence. How else would they know how to pray or to whom to direct it?
20
Ibid., 490.8to take these aspects into consideration explicitly when reading prayers and
hymns—even if the evidence for determining the details of a practice, communi-
ty, or institution is more limited than one would like—may lead to failing to
understand fully or seriously misunderstanding the prayers one reads and the
humans who produced and/or utilized them.
P RAYERS AND H YMNS IN A G ENERAL M ESOPOTAMIAN P ERSPECTIVE :
Although this book focuses on language and on increasing one’s Akkadian
fluency, the above brief remarks provide a conceptual starting point for going
beyond reading Mesopotamian prayers and hymns as texts that simply “speak
for themselves.” It moves the reader toward interpreting prayers and hymns in a
multi-faceted manner as cultural artifacts situated in a subset of human activities
identified as religious. But all of this raises an initial question that needs to be
explored: How does one identify a prayer or a hymn when reading an Akkadian
text? Although this is not the place to present a complete discussion of what
might constitute a genus “Mesopotamian ritual speech” of which “prayer” might
be distinguished as a species, some consideration of this issue is in order.
One could begin to answer this question of identification with an appeal to
particular textual details such as scribal rubrics (a label at the end of a text) or
superscripts (a label at the head of a text) that the ancient scribes used to identi-
fy and classify their own writings. In other words, one could identify prayers
based on the Mesopotamians’ own ideas of classifying prayers. Potential candi-
dates of such scribal metadata could include én, én-é-nu-ru, šu-íla, tamītu, ikribu,
ér-šà-ḫun-gá, nam-búr-bi, nam-érim-búr-ru-da, uš 11 -búr-ru-da, dingir-šà-dib-ba,
etc. Having identified these, one could then populate the categories of prayer
and hymn based on an indigenous classification. Unfortunately, the indigenous
labels are often problematic in their own right (see the extensive discussion of
the shuilla-rubric below), and not every text bears one, thus potentially depriv-
ing the dataset of some relevant texts. Moreover, while some rubrics, for exam-
ple, ikribu, might be translated generically as “prayer,” there is no native classi-
fier that corresponds to the broad categories of prayers and hymns proposed
here. Thus, there is a more fundamental problem with this well-meaning meth-
odology: one must already know what a prayer/hymn is before one can identify
the indigenous superscripts or rubrics that would supposedly populate the cate-
gory with texts. Rather than using tacit notions of prayer and hymn as a guide,
one might instead simply recognize that one is guided initially in the classifica-
tory endeavor by specific definitions arising from one’s own sphere and then to
refine and clarify these definitions in interaction with the data that is encoun-
tered from the ancient world. In other words, in proposing to treat certain Akka-
dian texts as prayers and hymns, the modern reader must impose their own ide-I NTRODUCTION
9
as upon them initially. 21 But as the modern reader works with the texts, a pro-
cess is initiated in which one attempts to understand them with increasing preci-
sion within their own cultural contexts. Ideally, this process will in turn lead to
improvements in the models/definitions one uses to translate and interpret the
texts in and for the contemporary sphere.
An initial foray into the subject might begin with an everyday notion of
prayer and hymn as mentioned above. A prayer, to start with, is a kind of reli-
gious, ritual form of speech that communicates one’s concerns/petitions to a
benevolent supra-human being (or more than one being) via words; a hymn is a
similar communication with a narrower thematic focus: petition is either lacking
or very restricted while praise and adoration (the expression of a different kind
of concern) dominate the text. The boundary between the two is not hard and
fast. Despite the fuzzy boundary, these initial definitions are useful for the pre-
sent analytical purpose. But there are some aspects of the definitions that raise
important questions that deserve fuller consideration. In the attempt to answer
these questions, the definition of prayer offered above will develop toward one
that more suitably fits the Mesopotamian data.
First, what does benevolent supra-human being mean in polytheistic ancient Mes-
opotamia? 22 In Mesopotamia there were a great many entities that were not hu-
man, though characterized anthropomorphically, 23 and had powers that went
well-beyond normal human capacity. These supra-human beings included
ghosts, gods, protective spirits (e.g., lamassū and šēdū), demons, witches, certain
cult-objects, and others (e.g., the apkallū, “primordial semi-divine sages”). 24 Hu-
mans could use ritual speech to communicate with all of these beings; descrip-
21
Although this point is a commonplace among social scientific and religious studies scholars, it
seems to be resisted by ancient historians. See classicist Sarah Iles Johnston’s review article
“Describing the Undefinable: New Books on Magic and Old Problems of Definition,” History of
Religions 43.1 (2003), 50–54, especially 54 for the same conclusion as presented above. In her
concluding remarks, she offers an important reason for imposing our own categories on the data
we study. She says that “without etic categories [that is, categories defined by the outside inves-
tigator], however provisional, the Hellenist is unable to talk to the Assyriologist, the Egyptologist
to the scholar of Judaism.” In other words, if our work is to be meaningful and informative be-
yond the insular world of our own fields of study, constructing meaningful categories that com-
municate across contemporary academic boundaries is absolutely essential.
22
We could, of course, have asked something similar about our own contemporary setting in the
earlier general discussion, but such was unnecessary for our present purposes.
23
One can see the anthropomorphism even in the incantation-prayer addressed to salt (see page
189) and in the one to the horse that pulls Marduk’s chariot in W. G. Lambert, Babylonian Oracle
Questions (Mesopotamian Civilizations 13; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2007), no. 9, lines 15–27.
For the role of anthropomorphism in the human imagining of supra-human powers, see Stewart
Guthrie, Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995)
generally and What Is a God? Anthropomorphic and Non-Anthropomorphic Aspects of Deity in An-
cient Mesopotamia (ed. Barbara Nevling Porter; Transactions of the Casco Bay Assyriological
Institute 2; Chebeaugue Island, ME: Casco Bay Assyriological Institute, 2009) for ancient Meso-
potamia.
24
See Black and Green for a convenient summary of the most important of these.10tions of such communication as well as the actual texts that contain these com-
munications are well-attested. Many of these powerful beings could be both be-
nevolent and malevolent toward a human. Enlil, for example, could be gracious
or vindictive; family ghosts could be implored for help or ritually expelled to the
netherworld; the apkallū, the sages of Ea, could assist or afflict humans; Pazuzu
was to be feared in his own right as a demon but could also be utilized for apo-
tropaic purposes against Lamashtu. 25 In order for a definition of prayer to be
useful in Mesopotamia, it needs to specify that “benevolent supra-human being,”
for the present purposes, refers to any supra-human being to whom a text directs
itself and about whom the text assumes, implicitly or explicitly, sufficient power
to aid the speaker. Because the text expresses hope for a beneficent response,
one might find words of deference or honor addressed to the supra-human pow-
er at the beginning of the communication (see below, for example, on the struc-
ture of the incantation-prayer). This text-centered orientation makes speculation
about an actual speaker’s subjective intention or emotion irrelevant. The per-
spective and warrants of the text are all that is accessible to modern readers.
Because the present definition defines prayer as something directed to be-
nevolent supra-human powers, texts that communicate concerns or desires to
malevolent demons, ghosts, witches, illnesses, and other powerful entities are
not prayers. The same applies to texts that address themselves to mere humans
or no one in particular, benevolent or otherwise. These texts use forms of ritual
speech, to be sure (see below); but an investigation of the broader domain of
“Mesopotamian ritual speech” goes beyond the present purpose, which is fo-
cused on the narrower categories of Mesopotamian prayer and the even more
focused category of hymn or praise. Other forms of ritual speech will be brought
into the present discussion only in so far as they help delineate the conceptual
parameters of prayer and praise by way of contrast (see fig. 1).
Second, does the descriptor “communication via words” in the initial definition
do justice to the Mesopotamian data about prayer and praise? Despite the promi-
nence and therefore usefulness that verbal communication has for the present
purpose (this book does after all deal with language), the answer is negative.
“Communication via words” does Mesopotamian prayer justice no more than it
does justice to the contemporary Muslim practice of ṣalāt (   ). Throughout the
ancient Near East, texts that contain or describe prayers and hymns—recognized
as such by the initial definition given above—often record or prescribe various
bodily gestures. These may include prostration, raising one’s hands, kneeling,
lifting up one’s head, facing oneself toward a temple, etc. as well as ritual acts
25

an iconographic perspective, see Anthony Green, “Beneficent Spirits and Malevolent Demons:

such as setting up altars, making offerings, applying substances to one’s body,
and manipulating objects (e.g., figurines or other items) before, during, and/or
after the recitation of the verbal communication. For a variety of reasons, the
descriptions of such practices may not be preserved with the texts to be recited
and so may not be as easily identified. Nevertheless, attending to these other
features—and therefore adjusting the definition of prayer in light of them—is
important in order to avoid a truncated understanding of Mesopotamian prayer
and praise. In order to capture the discourse/practice complex that is Mesopo-
tamian prayer, it is advisable to think about most prayers as “ritual-prayers,”
comprising dromena, that which is done, and legomena, that which is spoken. 26
Further, a definition of Mesopotamian prayer should avoid making commu-
nication via words a central or essential feature. Obviously the verbal or textual
side of prayer is important for the purposes of this volume. Yet this focus should
not unduly limit one’s view of Mesopotamian prayer and praise. Although non-
verbal prayer is not explored in this volume, it is important to keep in mind that
a votive statue placed in a temple or a cylinder seal depicting a presentation
scene may represent a petitioner’s attempt to express their concerns or praise to
a benevolent being visually, a manner completely lacking any linguistic form of
communication. 27
26
There are exceptions. Some prayers, e.g., the prayers used in royal building inscriptions, do
not as far as we know have a ritual element.
27
For general remarks on votive statues, see, e.g., Dominique Collon, Ancient Near Eastern Art
(Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995), 60–62, with a photo of the
famous Tell Asmar votive statues; on presentation scenes, see her Near Eastern Seals (Interpreting
the Past; Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1990), 46–47. We should not
neglect to mention the fact that some cylinder seal legends (inscriptions) contained actual pray-
ers in Sumerian and Akkadian. Although probably not intended for speaking aloud, these in-
scribed supplications were “recited” with each impression of the seal. For many examples of
these silent prayers, see Henri Limet, Les legendes de sceaux cassites (Académie royale de Bel-
gique, Classe des letters: Mémoires LX/2; Bruxelles: Palais des Académies, 1971).12Third, does the phrase “one’s concerns/petitions” adequately capture all that one
might see in Mesopotamian texts identified as prayers? No. One might suggest that
petitions, easily identified since they are usually expressed grammatically with
imperatives or precatives, are essential to identifying and understanding prayers
because supplicants seem always to present at least one request in the course of a
prayer and sometimes many, many more (as in, e.g., Nebuchadnezzar’s prayer to
Nabu on page 475). 28 But petitions sometimes comprise a tiny fraction of what
one sees in a prayer. For example, in Nabu 1 (see page 325), the petition consists
of only one line in twenty, a mere five percent. Moreover, hymns, a subset of
prayer, may not contain a petition at all, but occupy themselves with enumerat-
ing the character and actions of the deity. Although one might say that con-
cerns/petitions capture important aspects of the content of prayers and hymns, it
would be a mistake to absolutize these as the exclusive content of what is com-
municated in the texts. What else therefore might a Mesopotamian prayer/hymn
generally contain?
Although an exhaustive listing is not appropriate here (in some cases, more
detail will be presented when various kinds of prayers are introduced), the fol-
lowing are important general elements one will find in the texts. Mesopotamian
prayers normally begin with an invocation of the deity by name, which identi-
fies the benevolent supra-human being to whom the prayer is directed. Just as
one might speak one’s friend’s name aloud in a group to gain their attention
before conversing with them, the invocation is intended to get the supra-human
being’s attention before the prayer continues on to other matters. Prayers also
often contain praise. Along with the invocation, for example, one may see a
hymnic introduction in which the supplicant praises the deity invoked via a list
of divine epithets, attributes, actions, or other features. This introductory praise
functions as a kind of formal greeting, a social protocol utilized when a social
inferior approaches a social superior with an unsolicited address (see the discus-
sion of shuillas below). When this hymnic element is present, the length varies
significantly from as little as one line to a dozen or more. Prayers may also end
with praise of thanksgiving, or rather, a promise to give the deity thanks via
verbal (see, e.g., the end of incantation-prayers) and/or other ritual means (see,
e.g., the animal sacrifices in the OB letter-prayer to Ninmug on page 105). In the
subset of prayer identified here as hymn, praise predominates throughout. An-
other common element of content in prayers is the self-presentation or self-
introduction formula, in which the supplicant identifies their name, filiation,
and perhaps personal gods. The supplicant may also voice their concerns in the
form of complaints or laments about the problems that have given them reason
to seek supra-human assistance. 29 During the course of praising, complaining to,
28
Moreover, hymns are not entirely devoid of petition. See, e.g., the OB hymn to Ishtar on page
111.
Cultic laments such as balags and ershemmas, composed in Sumerian and used liturgically by
the kalû, “cult-singer,” fall outside the purview of this study. The ershaḫunga-prayers, however,
29I NTRODUCTION
13
or petitioning the deity or in their promise of thanksgiving the supplicant may
refer to various ritual actions they have performed, are performing, or will per-
form. These descriptions in the text of the prayer are not always identical to or
do not always seem to correspond to the ritual instructions that may accompa-
ny the text. (The ritual instructions may be listed in a separate section on the
tablet at the end of the prayer or written on a separate ritual tablet altogether in
the case of prayers that belong to long ritual series such as Maqlû.) The reason
for what seems to be an imperfect correspondence may be due to the fact that
the precise meaning of a ritual act mentioned in the prayer is not fully under-
stood (e.g., sissikta ṣabātu, “to seize the hem”), that the ritual instructions are
truncated or entirely lacking, the prayer or ritual has undergone scribal devel-
opment, leaving evidence of such in the resulting mismatch, and/or that the text
assumes the specialist would have known certain routine procedures and there-
fore did not record them (e.g., when to bow, when to kneel, etc.). But there are
numerous instances of the contrary situation; that is, there are texts that show a
close correspondence between ritual actions mentioned in the prayer and the
ritual instructions (see, e.g., Nusku 12 on page 179). 30
Fourth, despite the complexities of the issue, it is an important and worth-
while exercise to revisit the earlier concern with indigenous categorization of
texts and ask, Does the definition of Mesopotamian textual prayer developed here jibe
with the various Mesopotamian categorization of texts (i.e., the scribal metadata)?
And if not, should this be a concern? To the first question, the answer will have to
be a firm no; the present definition actually cuts across various Mesopotamian
scribal categories. The answer to the second question should probably be both
yes and no. It should be a concern that the present definition does not corre-
spond to any ancient category and one ought to remain aware of the fact that a
modern scholarly conceptualization of categories is different from the indige-
nous Mesopotamian ones. On the other hand, it is the prerogative of the inter-
preter to establish what seem to be productive avenues of cultural interpreta-
tion, including how to categorize and organize data so that it will communicate
with contemporaries. Indigenous sources are just that, sources. They should of
course inform contemporary scholarship; but they should not dictate the interpre-
tive results. 31 The brief discussion in the next several paragraphs will show via
also part of kalûtu, “the craft of the cult-singer,” are discussed below. Although the balags and
ershemmas were also given interlinear Akkadian translations by ancient scribes, the ershaḫungas
were included in this volume because they have affinities with some of the monolingual Akkadi-
an penitential prayers for individuals (i.e., the dingirshadibbas and the shuilla Marduk 4). More-
over, the one ershaḫunga-prayer treated in this volume, the prayer to any god (see page 447),
has appeared in various anthologies of Mesopotamian/Akkadian prayers.

When our ancient sources are allowed to determine or dictate to us our interpretive results,
we have moved from being an ancient historian to a curator or caretaker of antiquity. See Bruce
Lincoln, “Theses on Method,” Method & Theory in the Study of Religion 8 (1996), 225–27 (reprint-
ed in MTSR 17 [2005], 8–10).14concrete examples how the present categorization of prayer cuts across known
Mesopotamian scribal categories and how this informs and refines the present
understanding of prayer. The discussion will also suggest, however, that there is
an interpretive benefit in maintaining modern constructions of categorization
despite the important ancient scribal rubrics and superscripts that have come
down to us.
Consider the following two texts. Each is the ritual wording of a (different)
shaziga-ritual that was used to remedy a man’s sexual impotence. The Sumerian
term šà-zi-ga (Akk. nīš libbi, “rising of the heart”) was the rubric scribes used to
classify the purpose of these rituals. They normally placed the rubrics at the end
of the text. The superscript én, discussed further below, marks the beginning of
the ritual’s wording recited in the course of the ritual.
én: Let the wind blow (lillik)! Let the grove quake (linūš).
Let the clouds gather (lištakṣir)! Let the moisture fall (littuk)!
Let my potency be (lū) flowing river water!
Let my penis be (lū) a (taut) harp string
So that it will not slip out of her! tu 6 én. 32
én: O Adad, canal inspector of heaven, son of Anu,
Who gives oracular decisions for all people, the protector of the land,
At your supreme command which cannot be opposed,
And your faithful affirmation which cannot be altered,
May NN son of NN, become stiff (limgug) 33 for NN, daughter of NN,
may he come into contact with (limḫaṣ), mount (lirkab), and
penetrate (lišērib) (her)! tu 6 én. 34
The second text begins with an invocation of a supra-human being; there
are several honorific epithets and statements intended to glorify the deity; and
the text concludes with a complex petition (note the four precatives) for the dei-
ty to act upon. It becomes clear in the course of the prayer that the deity is con-
strued as benevolent because a) he is assumed to be interested in hearing the
prayer and b) he is assumed to be capable of acting upon it for the benefit of the
supplicant. This text is clearly a prayer according to the definition developed
above (more specifically, modern scholars call this text an “incantation-prayer,”
about which see page 24 below). 35

“so-and-so.” The actual names of the people involved would be filled in during the ritual.

As for the first text, the agent to whom it is directed, if any at all, is unclear;
there is no invocation. The text does, however, contain what one might call peti-
tions (note the four precatives and the two uses of lū). These statements are
grammatically identical to what one sees in the petitions of the second text. In
fact, the precatives in the first shaziga dominate the text even more so. But the
precatives in this first text have a more general character than those in the sec-
ond. Although the precatives in both texts express the speaker’s desires (wishes,
hopes), only those in the second may be further qualified as petitions since peti-
tions by definition require the involvement of one thought capable of responding
(the addressee, Adad). As there is no invocation of a benevolent supra-human
being to act upon the precatives in the first text, they remain conceptually at a
more general level of expressed desire. Because it lacks an invocation of a be-
nevolent supra-human being, praise, and petition the first shaziga, according to
the present definition, is not a prayer (or hymn); rather, it is another form of
ritual speech.
To be sure, both texts belong to the corpus of shaziga-rituals, designated by
a common rubric; both texts were used for the same general remedial purpose.
But only the second one qualifies as a prayer according to the definition devel-
oped above. One might be inclined to adjust one’s definition of prayer to ac-
count for this mismatch between the modern definition and the ancient rubrics.
This is, of course, one way to allow the evidence to re-shape the heuristic defini-
tion. The following paragraphs, however, will suggest that such is unnecessary
and ultimately may be unhelpful to the larger interpretive project.
The two examples of shazigas bring up another, more general (and trouble-
some) scribal label that illustrates how the present definition of prayer cuts
across Mesopotamian categories: the Sumerian superscript én or én-é-nu-ru in
OB and older texts. 36 These Sumerian terms are equivalent to the Akkadian term
šiptu and translated into English, conventionally and unfortunately, as “incanta-
tion.” 37 As was stated earlier, there are a great many ritual texts in Akkadian
that contain prescribed words to communicate concerns or desires to demons,
ghosts, witches, illnesses, and other malevolent things/forces. These texts usual-
ly communicate a desire for protection from (apotropaism) or the expulsion of
(exorcism) these forces. The following is a representative example:
én: Fire, fire!
Fire seized a lone man.
It seized (his) insides, (his) temple,

ical study.
37
The translation is unfortunate because “incantation” has been closely associated with magic,
paganism, primitivism, and generally those things that are “other” to “true” religion (especially
as defined by Protestant Europeans). For the intellectual background to such issues in the West,
see Stanley Tambiah, Magic, Science, Religion, and the Scope of Rationality (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1990), 1–41.16It spread (to others) the gnawing of (his) insides,
The stock of the human race was diminished.
Belet-ili went before Ea the king,
“O Ea, humankind was created by your spell,
“Second, you pinched off their clay
from the firmament of the depths.
“By your great command, you determined their capacities.
“I cast a spell on the ...-disease, fever, boils,
“Leprosy(?), jaundice!
“Rain down like dew,
“Flow down like tears,
“Go down to the netherworld!”
This incantation is an incantation of Belet-ili, the great queen. 38
Although these kinds of texts are clearly excluded from the present understand-
ing of prayer because they are directed at malevolent (here, an illness) rather
than benevolent powers, they often bear one of the two Sumerian superscripts,
én or én-é-nu-ru, under discussion. There are a number of other texts that also
bear one of these superscripts but are directed at such things as an animal, the
wind, a would-be human lover, and in some cases nothing clearly discernible, as
in the first shaziga cited above. Finally, as in the second shaziga cited, there are
still other texts that bear the én superscript but also fit the present definition of
prayer. In fact, nearly all of the SB shuilla- and dingirshadibba-prayers in this
volume bear the én superscript (and are therefore usually called “incantation-
prayers” by contemporary scholars). Besides recognizing that our constructed
category of prayer cuts across another indigenous Mesopotamian scribal catego-
ry, this fact calls for some deeper reflection about how the notion of prayer that
is developed here relates to the ancient Mesopotamian category of ritual speech
labeled én—a Sumerian. term often translated simply as “incantation” but better
rendered “ritual wording.” 39
First, applying an antiquated Frazerian dichotomy between “mechanical”
magic and “personal” religion—personal in that volitional agents are involved—
should be resisted because it is not helpful in clarifying or explaining the texts. 40
38
See W. G. Lambert, “Fire Incantations,” AfO 23 (1970), 39–45 for an edition of the text and
Foster, 971, whose translation is cited here.
Despite the fact that “ritual wording” is probably a better translation of the terms én and šiptu,
the conventional translation “incantation” is so entrenched in Assyriological scholarship that we
have (hesitantly) opted to use this rendering throughout the volume. For how our modern notion
of prayer does not correspond with the ancient superscript én, see briefly W. G. Lambert, “The
Classification of Incantations,” in Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale,
Held at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005 (ed. Robert D. Biggs,

ence courtesy of Christopher Frechette).

In discussing these two shaziga-prayers above, their ancient scribal categoriza-
tion, and how these relate to a modern definition of prayer, only the formal,
linguistic features of the texts have been addressed. Both shazigas—both of
which also bear the én superscript—are forms of ritual speech used for the same
remedial purpose, and they “work” conceptually rather similarly, whatever one
decides to call them in a modern system of classification. Note, for example, the
ritual instructions that follow each of the two shazigas. 41 Although the instruc-
tions for each text differ with regard to the accompanying ritual actions, they do
agree that the ritual wording for each, identified on the tablet with the én super-
script in both cases, is to be recited seven times. Despite their respective ad-
dressees (or lack thereof), both were apparently considered more effective when
repeated multiple times. If repetition of words is associated with “mechanical”
magic, as it often was among some past interpreters, 42 then one would have to
argue that the shaziga that the above definition identifies as a prayer (called an
“incantation-prayer” by scholars today) is just as “magical” as the shaziga that
the above definition dismisses from the category of prayer (and therefore is of-
ten simply called an “incantation” by modern scholars). In this case, therefore,
the magic vs. religion model is not very helpful in making sense of the data. A
better interpretation is to recognize that the common ritual instructions calling
for repetition of these two shazigas point to conceptual similarities in the utiliza-
tion of these two examples of ritual speech (both labeled én by the ancients),
despite the modern distinction in seeing one as prayer and one as not-prayer.
Another important point in this regard is that the involvement of a deity in
a text labeled a prayer by modern scholarship does not necessarily impute to this
form of ritual speech a more contingent or uncertain efficaciousness than that
associated with texts one might view as “mechanical” incantations. It would be a
mistake to think that the supplicant nervously had to await the deity’s answer to
the shaziga identified as a prayer but could feel confident that the other text
worked automatically against whatever or whomever it was directed. 43 There
are, to be sure, places where one reads of supplicants asking a deity to hear or
accept their prayer and others when supplicants mention how a deity has ac-
cepted or heard their prayer. 44 There are even complaints about unheeded pray-
ers (see Marduk 4, lines 3–4 on page 296). Clearly, the personal-agent-element
of a prayer elicited talk from the Mesopotamians about prayer in terms of divine
41
The ritual instructions are identified on the tablet by the typical indicator in Sumerian, dù-dù-
bi, “its ritual action.” The ritual instructions are generally placed immediately after the last line
of the ritual wording.
42
This was historically a problem among Protestant interpreters, who could appeal to Matt 6:7–
8 to support their position.
43
There are, of course, cases of prayer in Mesopotamia in which the supplicants do await a
divine response (see, e.g., the tamitus). But this is due to the particular kind of prayer being
offered, one which accompanies an oracular extispicy.
44
Several examples of both situations can be found under the words magāru (CAD M/1, 38–39),
leqû (CAD L, 136–37), and šemû (CAD Š/2, 284–85), among others.18response or lack thereof. Indeed, the ancient Mesopotamians knew full well that
the gods were sovereign over the affairs of humans; the gods ultimately decided
if, when, and how a response to human supplication would occur (see Ludlul bēl
nēmeqi, for example). 45 But this need not contradict the fact that some (most?)
prayers seem to have worked, i.e., instilled good reason for the supplicant to
have confidence that positive results had been gained for their petitions, simply
by virtue of their being spoken. In other words, despite modern misgivings about
inconsistency, the involvement of a personal, benevolent agent need not have
ruled out a genuine confidence in the efficaciousness of a prayer. 46 In fact, some
ritual instructions for prayers actually state that after a specified number of reci-
tations of the text the supplicant’s prayer would be heard (see, e.g., Gula 1a, line
28 on page 252). Such a statement can plausibly be interpreted as intended to
instill confidence in the supplicant. 47 (Of course, this confident expectation
clashed sometimes with lived reality and resulted in dashed hopes and deep des-
pair, as we see in Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 1–48. The sufferer does everything right
but sees nothing but wrong around him!) These points should again caution us
from drawing an overly-precise conceptual distinction in ancient Mesopotamia
between impersonal ritual speech directed at malevolent (or other kinds of) enti-
ties and ritual speech directed at personal and benevolent agents (i.e., what we
are calling prayer).
If this discussion has somewhat blurred the conceptual line between the
forms of ritual speech that are often called “incantation” by modern scholars and
the present category of “prayer” (including what modern scholars call “incanta-
tion-prayers”) then it is has achieved its purpose.
It would, however, be a mistake, I think, simply to dissolve the conceptual
boundaries between all Mesopotamian texts that the present definition identifies
as prayers and all Mesopotamian texts that follow the scribal én superscript.
Though some of the texts called prayers here are identified by the Mesopotami-
ans as an én (thus the modern label “incantation-prayer”), there are many other
texts that the present definition would identify as a prayer but do not bear the
én label (e.g., the OB ikribu-like prayer, the NB royal prayer, and the OB letter-
prayer, to name three in this volume). Maintaining a distinct category of prayer

See Maul’s statement in ZB, 74 and the observation by Claus Ambos, cited in note 99 below.
See also the very interesting tamitu-prayer in which the supplicant queries Shamash and Adad
regarding whether or not his penitential prayer (šigû) will be accepted by the gods. The reply,
which is not preserved, would have been given via extispicy. See W. G. Lambert, Babylonian

based on a modern definition, therefore, helps one analytically by identifying
and including these other, similar texts for study within the dataset. (At the
same time, of course, one must keep in mind that the Mesopotamians themselves
may have been baffled by such a lumping together of what to their minds were
probably distinct groups of texts.) Furthermore, even among those texts catego-
rized as prayers by the definition that do in fact bear the én label, there are for-
mal features that mark a conceptual distinction between them and other forms
of ritual speech (such as incantations directed against malevolent powers) that
bear the én label. This calls for a brief explanation.
If one surveys the various texts scholars call incantations, that is, the many
texts bearing the scribal rubric én or én-é-nu-ru, one can generally see two op-
posing formal characteristics that distinguish incantation-prayers from the other
incantation texts: the first concerns how the texts begin; the other, how the texts
end. First, incantation-prayers invoke a supra-human power near the beginning
of the text who will help, it is assumed, the supplicant achieve a favorable result
for their petitions—a benevolent supra-human power. Non-prayer incantations,
on the other hand, may announce at the beginning to what or whom the incan-
tation addresses itself, but the addressee is not invoked to help achieve the
speaker’s expressed desires. Rather, the addressee is usually told what to do. Alt-
hough incantation-prayers may use imperatives, they do so typically within a
framework that begins (and often ends) with praise, a sign of deference; the im-
peratives in these texts, therefore, have quite a different tone than the ones in
non-prayer incantations. This is an important formal difference that hints at a
conceptual distinction. This distinction is clarified by the other formal character-
istic. 48
The second formal characteristic lies in the way the speaker of an incanta-
tion gained help for their ritual speech’s effectiveness: help came in the form of
legitimation formulae, generally attached at the conclusion of an incantation, in
which the incantation was asserted to be divine rather than human speech. The
most common Akkadian examples include šiptu ul yuttun (yattun), “the incanta-
tion is not mine,” šipat DN, “(it is) the incantation of [some deity],” ina qibīt DN,
48
A general survey—by no means exhaustive—of various terms for or used with supplication or
beseeching (atnu, emēqu [Št], enēnu, ikribu, leqû, magāru, maḫāru, naqbītu, nīš qāti, qāta našû,
qibītu [see CAD Q, 246–47], sīpu, sullû [noun and verb], suppû [noun and verb], surāru, surruru,
šemû, šuʾillakku, tarsītu, tēmēqu, tēnīnu, teslītu, tespītu, unnīnu, utnēnu, and upna petû) showed that
when such was directed to non-humans—kings could also hear supplications—the non-humans
were always benevolent powers (such as deities), never malevolent ones (such as demons). The
distinction is rather clearly made in one text that describes the utukku-demon as ša teslītu lā
imaḫḫaru, “who does not accept prayer” (see CAD T, 370 [bilingual section], citing CT 17 36,
K.9272:14 and duplicates). We should, however, probably not expect perfect consistency as the
following illustrates. There are some instances in which Lamashtu, commonly believed to be a
demon, “accepts a prayer” (unnīna leqû, see CAD L, 136 for references). Despite her malevolency,
Lamashtu was considered to be a deity, the daughter of Anu, in ancient Mesopotamia (see Black
and Green, 115–16). Despite this borderline case, it seems that the Mesopotamians generally
made a distinction between gods and demons when they used “prayer” words.20“by order of [some deity],” and DN šipta iddi/iqbi, “[some deity] cast/spoke the
incantation.” 49 These legitimation formulae were intended to raise the authority
of the ritual speech to the level of divine decree and thereby coerce the address-
ee to obey. As this volume shows, most incantation-prayers conclude with either
a petition or thanksgiving for the benevolent power’s favorable response. Only
very rarely does one see the legitimation formulae in incantation-prayers. For
example, there are only four instances of šiptu ul yuttun attached to an incanta-
tion-prayer, which makes these four quite exceptional among this very populous
category of texts. 50 See, likewise, Maqlû I 36 (see page 164), in which the suppli-
cant uses the ina qibīt formula to assert the accomplished defeat of the malevo-
lent witch. 51 These exceptions are reminders that cultural data rarely fit neatly
into compartmentalized categories. However, the fact that they are exceptional
examples bolsters the usefulness of the analytical generalization presented here.
From the above observations, it may be concluded that some ritual texts
modern scholars call incantations were generally construed as divine speech
while those identified as incantation-prayers generally reflect that of human
speech. 52 Even though this generalization is still simplistic, 53 it suggests there is
heuristic value to maintaining our modern category of prayer as a subset of
Mesopotamian ritual speech (see fig. 2).
One final question concludes this discussion of refining a definition of pray-
er and praise to fit the Akkadian material, namely, how do the communal and
institutional aspects of religious activity come to bear upon our understanding of Ak-
kadian prayer and praise?
As for the communal side of the issue, we do not know as much as we
would like about the actual Sitz im Leben of many prayers (see the descriptions
below). Based on the content of the ritual instructions that often follow the
wording of many prayers, however, the supplicant and the ritual expert seem to
have been the only people involved, at least usually, in the actual performance of
49
Sometimes this formula is expanded with –ma anāku ušanni/ašši, “and I repeated/bore (it).”

tions,” in Gazing on the Deep: Ancient Near Eastern, Biblical, and Jewish Studies in Honor of Tzvi

ceptional cases of these formulae in what the definition developed in this introduction would
identify as prayers.

a ritual-prayer (i.e., reciting the text and performing the ritual actions that ac-
companied it). 54 Aside from certain kinds of royal prayers that may have in-
cluded a public element to them, ancient Akkadian prayers were not spoken in a
congregational setting; rather, they were individual. Despite the limited number
of people involved, such ritual-prayers were not necessarily private since they
may have been performed on a roof or beside a canal, although sometimes an
inaccessible place was prescribed. In any case, although ritual-prayers were in-
tended for individuals, they were hardly individualistic.
Who was present at or had access to the location of the ritual-prayer’s en-
actment is probably the least important element of the communal aspect of Mes-
opotamian prayer. The broader social embeddedness of the individual and the
manner in which this shaped their identity occupy a much more important role
in the proper understanding of ancient Akkadian prayers. The Mesopotamians
seem to have created personal identity primarily via their family, social posi-
tion/occupation, and city, among other things. 55 Even when praying alone (or
only with the ritual expert), these communal aspects of life were ever-present
concerns and therefore unsurprisingly impacted the kinds of petitions we find in
the prayers. For example, the ubiquitous petition for life (balāṭu) included more
than biological health or longevity; “life” encompassed the entire social and
physical well-being of the person, as is clear from the poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi. In
this doxological text the protagonist of the poem recounts how Marduk’s anger
resulted in his social alienation (I 41–104) and physical suffering (II 49–120).
When Marduk sent healing, the physical ailments were dispelled (III 68–line m)
and the sufferer was reintegrated into his community in a very public manner
54
In the case of prayers of the diviner, the supplicant and ritual expert were one and the same.
And in the cases of letter-prayers and royal prayers in building inscriptions, there are no ritual
experts involved. The generalizations in this paragraph will need adjustment according to the
specific kind of prayer one is reading.
55
See Karel van der Toorn, Family Religion in Babylonia, Syria, and Israel: Continuity and Change
in the Forms of Religious Life (SHCANE 7. Leiden: Brill, 1996).22(IV 38ff.). In fact, people marveled at his renewed well-being and praised the
gods for it (IV 70–82). Although there is much more one might say here, this one
examples illustrates the importance in becoming familiar with and keeping in
mind the broader communal and social contexts as one interprets ancient pray-
ers.
As for the institutional perspective, all of the texts that have come down to
us were preserved in writing by a group of elite, literate members of ancient
Mesopotamian society, the scribes. Most of the documents that the above defini-
tion of religion would identify as religious are not simple, workaday scribal texts
such as letters, account summaries, or receipts. Rather, they are complicated
texts that demonstrate linguistic sophistication, contain theological erudition,
and would have required ritual expertise for their proper execution (such as the
performance of an extispicy, the making of figurines, the setting up of altars,
etc.). The scribes/ritual experts that composed and used these texts were likely
therefore not normal scribes but masters of the scribal craft (Akk. ummânū),
well-educated in the traditional cuneiform curricula. Most of them would have
worked for one or both of the great institutions of their day: the royal palace
and the temples. It follows that the composition and preservation of much of the
material treated in this volume was due to the patronage/support of the king
and/or the temples. Furthermore, judging from the content of the prayers and
hymns, their most common kinds of findspots (e.g., palaces and temples), and
clues from texts such as royal letters, the king was the most important, though
certainly not the exclusive, user/beneficiary of these prayers and hymns.
The three most important institutional groups of scholars/ritual experts
with regard to the Akkadian prayers and hymns in this volume are the diviners
(bārû), the exorcists (āšipū), and the cult-singers (kalû). Although they were
working in earlier times (see, e.g., the two OB prayers of the diviner in this vol-
ume), our best evidence for these three professions comes from first millennium
tablets. From such texts we learn that these men—they were all men to the best
of our knowledge—served the king and temples via their learned corpora, in-
cluding many prayers that they believed derived from the gods themselves. 56
Thus, from an institutional rather than formal textual perspective many ritual-
prayers could also be considered divine speech because the gods had delivered
them to the institutional experts, who in turn performed them for and with the
supplicant—adapting them as necessary. 57 In order to contextualize specific

Understanding an ancient Mesopotamian prayer as both human (primarily) and divine speech
is akin to a theological understanding of Christianity’s most well-known prayer. The Lord’s Pray-
er was attributed to Jesus, who is traditionally identified as divinity incarnate; was recorded by a
biblical author in Scripture, which is traditionally believed to be divinely-inspired; and is prayed
by contemporary Christians on their own behalf. For a similar issue in contemporary Maya ritu-
als, see William F. Hanks, “Exorcism and the Description of Participant Roles,” in Natural Histo-
ries of Discourse (ed. Michael Silvertein and Greg Urban; Chicago: University of Chicago Press,I NTRODUCTION

Having explored the definition of prayer presented in the first section of this
introduction and modifying it in light of the Mesopotamian material in the sec-
ond, this third section turns to consider the various classes that scholars have
recognized as examples of Mesopotamian prayer. Some of the classes discussed
below are recognized on the basis of ancient scribal labels and rubrics (e.g.,
shuillas, ikribus, and tamitus). Other classes are modern conventions, created
because scholars recognized certain thematic and/or structural similarities in the
texts (e.g., incantation-prayers, royal prayers, and letter-prayers). A com-
prehensive treatment of every class of Mesopotamian prayer in Akkadian is not

“all ritual speech in Maya could be construed as a sort of semiquote, insofar as shamans claim to
have learned its forms either from other shamans, from dreams, or in charismatic dialogues with
the very sprits they invoke in the third person. Shamans are not merely relayers of divine speech,
however, since they consciously change their prayer forms over time, in order to beautify them.”

The caveat “when appropriate” is necessary because not all prayers are attributable to one of
these three groups.

eral of the more important ones. 60
Incantation-prayers:
Because it is the largest group of prayers preserved in Akkadian and the best
represented class in this volume, the section begins with a lengthy and more
technical discussion of Akkadian prayers known broadly as the incantation-
prayer and considers the vexing issue of the relationship between the incanta-
tion-prayer and the shuillas, a very important member of the incantation-prayer
group in the history of scholarship. After sorting through this issue and present-
ing a full discussion of shuillas, two other kinds of incantation-prayers are more
briefly discussed, namely, the namburbi-prayers and the dingirshadibba-prayers.

So-called prayer names, that is, names of people that express petition, praise, or lament (e.g.,
Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur, “O Nabu, guard my firstborn,” Aššur-rabi, “Ashur is great!,” and Ātanaḫ-ilī, “I
have become weary, my god!”), are not treated in this introduction (see, e.g., von Soden,
“Gebebt II,” §6 and Rainer Albertz, Persönliche Frömmigkeit und offizielle Religion: Religionsinterner
Pluralismus in Israel und Babylon [Stuttgart: Calwer Verlag, 1978; repr., Atlanta: Society of Bibli-
cal Literature, 2005], 102–19). Although probably practiced in ancient Mesopotamia, this intro-
duction will also leave extemporaneous prayer out of consideration. See the brief comments by
von Soden in “Gebet II,” §7. See also the observation by Richard I. Caplice (The Akkadian Nam-
burbi Texts: An Introduction [SANE 1/1; Los Angeles: Undena, 1974], 12) that some instructions
for namburbi-rituals direct the supplicant to speak whatever is on their mind (expressed in Akk.

Whether one studies Mesopotamian prayers primarily within their own cul-
tural contexts or for comparative purposes, one will likely encounter shuillas.
The term shuilla is derived from a Sumerian rubric meaning “lifted hand(s)” that
functioned as a classifier of ritual-prayers. 61 Subscriptions to copies of such
prayers may include a shuilla-rubric, and both ritual instructions and descrip-
tions of ritual enactments may employ it to indicate the recitation of prayers of
this class. Gestures of lifted hands taken to express prayer or greeting are com-
mon in Mesopotamian figural art, and such gestures are attested in terms besides
those corresponding to this rubric. 62 Texts identified by a shuilla-rubric consti-
tute the best attested single category of Mesopotamian ritual-prayers. The term
“shuilla” refers to such ritual-prayers and the term “shuilla-prayer” refers explic-
itly to the texts to be recited. The present book includes eleven of them. Yet,
despite more than a century of modern scholarly investigation of texts bearing
this rubric, several fundamental problems bedevil the use of this term among
scholars and therefore require detailed attention. This introductory treatment
discusses each of the following, in turn:
(1) While three major classes of shuillas have been identified, scholars do not always
specify the one to which they are referring. This section offers a brief overview of the
evidence for these classes.
(2) Concerning the best attested of these classes, the Akkadian shuillas of the āšipu,
“exorcist,” a fundamental disagreement has arisen about whether the term shuilla
should be applied to texts not actually bearing this rubric but considered similar to
them. Because of this, it is often not apparent to what group of texts a given author
intends the term to refer. This section offers a summary of arguments on both sides of
the issue.
(3) Also concerning this best-attested class of shuilla, scholars disagree as to its pur-

This rubric, šu.íl.la (2) , combines the Sum. terms šu, “hand,” íl, “to lift,” and the nominalizing
element –a.
62
Various combinations of šu and íl (in some cases mu) and their corresponding Akkadian terms
qāta, “hand,” našû, “to lift,” and šuʾillakku, “lifted hands,” express a gesture of greeting/prayer
predicated of humans toward deities. Other idioms for such a gesture may be addressed to hu-
mans as well as to deities, e.g., ultu imittu karābu, “to greet with the right (hand),” and qāta elû,
“to raise the hand.”26pose and its defining characteristics. This section provides a detailed review of several
key issues and proposals.
(1) Three Classes of Shuillas: Three major classes of shuillas have been differ-
entiated based on the language in which the prayers are written and the ritual
expert associated with them. For each of these, some purpose and literary struc-
ture has been proposed. Yet, neither all occurrences of the rubric nor every
prayer labeled with it can be clearly associated with one of these classes or its
proposed purpose and structure. 63 Almost all shuillas have been associated with
one of two types of ritual expert, the kalû, “cult-singer,” or the āšipu, “exorcist.”
In Mesopotamian culture, in which adverse events were perceived as the result
of divine or demonic activity, the cult-singer was responsible for appeasing the
hearts of the angry gods by means of chanting lamentations and performing rites
of intercession; the exorcist was responsible for rituals offering prevention and
healing of illness, both spiritual and physical, as well as for effecting reconcilia-
tion between individuals and their personal deities, in effect preventing the pun-
ishments sent by the gods from taking full effect. 64
All known shuillas belonging to the craft of the cult-singer are in the Emesal
dialect of Sumerian. 65 These prayers probably originated in the public cult and
were performed, always one prayer to one deity, in the frame of an annual festi-
val, presumably at the end of a procession involving the statue of the deity ad-
dressed. They were recited in the first place to greet the deity. One type of them
was intended to calm the addressee, who immediately upon returning from a
cultic event interpreted as a battle, was caught up in a hostile mood.
In the craft of the exorcist, there are two major classes of shuillas distin-
guished, inter alia, by their language of composition, Akkadian or Sumerian. 66
Of the few shuillas of the exorcist written in Sumerian, a group of five were re-
cited in the Mīs pî (“washing of the mouth”) ritual, used for the animation of

Paul-Alain Beaulieu, “Late Babylonian Intellectual Life,” in The Babylonian World (ed. G. Leick;
New York: Routledge, 2007), 479. From a complementary perspective, Jean Bottéro associates
the cult-singer primarily with what he calls the theocentric cult, characterized by activities such
as feeding and offering of praise and luxury believed necessary to care for the gods, and the
exorcist primarily with what he calls the sacramental cult, characterized by activities concerned
with knowing the future and alleviating or preventing human suffering (Religion in Ancient Meso-
potamia [trans. T. L. Fagan; Chicago: University of Chicago, 2001], 114–202).

ological Explanations of the Emesal Šuilla-Prayers in Ancient Mesopotamia,” Orient 45 (2010),

66
A few texts associated with the exorcist do not fit easily in either of these classes, including
some bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian as well as in monolingual Sumerian texts found in rituals
intended to dissolve evil fates, including rituals pertaining to dreams and namburbi-rituals.I NTRODUCTION

divine images. 67 This ritual spanned two days, and these five prayers were all
recited at the high point of the ritual. 68 Four of these prayers are preserved; they
range from nineteen to forty-seven lines in length, and their content concerns
the activity of the ritual. 69 It is widely recognized that shuillas in monolingual
Akkadian were employed in a variety of ritual contexts and in many cases ex-
plicitly request one of the “high gods” to intercede with the speaker’s angry per-
sonal gods. Yet, proposals for a fuller grasp of the Akkadian shuillas’ purpose
and defining characteristics remain under discussion and are treated in more
detail below.
(2) Incantation-prayer = or ≠ Shuilla? The best attested class of shuillas are
those written in Akkadian and belonging to the craft of the exorcist. 70 All of the
shuillas in the present volume fall into this category and are referred to simply
as “Akkadian shuilla-prayers.” They have been classified along with other Akka-
dian ritual-prayers of the exorcist that bear not the shuilla-rubric but other clas-
sifying rubrics on the basis of the following shared basic literary structure. 71
1. Address (including invocation and praise),
2. Petition (including lament), and
3. Thanksgiving/blessing.
The resulting genre is conventionally known as Gebetsbeschwörung, “incantation-
prayer.” 72 Assyriologists, however, do not agree on the application of the term
shuilla within this broad category, and this discrepancy of usage adds confusion

About eighty individual such prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric are attested in roughly two
hundred fifty (some quite fragmentary) exemplars (i.e., tablets). Roughly forty additional prayers
not attested with the rubric may have belonged to this class. See Mayer, UFBG, 375–435, and

these structural proposals in detail, see Mayer, UFBG, 35.
72
For a discussion of the various terms employed in scholarship, see Mayer, UFBG, 7–9.28to scholarship concerning this rubric, which is already complex. Two influential
studies have differentiated sub-genres of this broad class proceeding from a fun-
damental distinction among rubrics: the term shuilla, “lifted hand(s),” which has
long been recognized as indicating a gesture of prayer or greeting (King, BMS,
xix-xx), and other rubrics recognized as indicating specific purposes, for exam-
ple, the dissolution of an evil omen or of a spell. Since the classification systems
of both of these studies remain in use among scholars, both are summarized
briefly here.
Kunstmann’s study from the 1930s made the term shuilla synonymous with
incantation-prayer (see BGB). Two factors apparently contributed to this usage:
the idiomatic meaning of the shuilla-rubric was taken as synonymous with
“prayer” in a general sense, and yet this rubric appeared on prayers regarded as
belonging to different sub-genres of incantation-prayer. The term “incantation-
prayer” grew out of a clear distinction between prayer and magic: these texts
were seen as incantations in that they accomplished their goal, in part, magical-
ly by the recitation of powerful speech and the carrying out of actions, both
speech and act being believed effective in themselves; they were seen as prayers
in that they addressed petitions to one or more gods (Kunstmann, BGB, 3–4).
Each incantation-prayer was placed into one of three categories: “general,” “spe-
cial,” or “in-between” on the basis of two criteria: (1) purpose, either general or
specific; and (2) emphasis, either on its magical actions or on the prayer itself
and its offering. Most of those bearing the shuilla-rubric were considered “gen-
eral shuillas” chiefly because they lacked indicators of specific purpose. These
also tended to include little ritual activity besides an offering. “Special shuillas”
clearly specified a purpose and were often accompanied by more complex ritual
actions. Those bearing the shuilla-rubric and including a further specification of
occasion or purpose were in most cases classified as “in-between” (Kunstmann,
BGB, 70–72). 73
Mayer in the 1970s advocated that in order to respect its native usage
among incantation-prayers, the term shuilla should be employed exclusively to
refer to those prayers which are actually attested with the rubric or to those
which arguably would have born it (Mayer, UFBG, 7–8, 377). The present vol-
ume espouses this position. Other scholars, however, continue to use the term
shuilla to refer to the broader category. Avoiding the dichotomy between magic
and ritual, this later study defined incantation-prayers as ritual petition-prayers
of the individual, explaining that they are: (1) oriented to a ritual unit; (2) com-
prised of mostly pre-formulated petitionary speech of an especially powerful
type; and (3) combined with other specified ritual actions over all of which a
73
Kunstmann placed only two prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric in the “special” category, one
on the basis of a clearly specified purpose added to the rubric, and the other on the basis that it
had several characteristics of incantations for activating materials for ritual use (BGB, 5, 80–82).
The latter, Nisaba 1, is included in the present volume at page 351.I NTRODUCTION
29
ritual expert presided on behalf of an individual (Mayer, UFBG, 10–12, 22). 74
This study identified in these ritual-prayers a two-part core, an address with
names and a petition, and around this core it described the following structure,
the sequence of which may vary (adapted from Mayer, UFBG, 36–37):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
By expressing the deity’s greatness, power and goodness, those praying can
make these qualities ritually present (vergegenwärtigen).
The petition may be developed in multiple respects or can be embedded in the
context of a motivating clause. If the petition is motivated by distress, it can be
expressed in the form of a “lament” and thereby appeal to the mercy of the god.
Petitioners may articulate before the god what they do in carrying out the pray-
er and ritual: namely that they turn to the god pleading, or that they have
brought certain “advance payment” in the form of sacrifices and gifts.
The petition referring to a specific concern may be preceded by a petition for the
merciful attention of the deity, and it may be extended by a petition for other
concerns.
An “offer to perform,” i.e., the promise to praise the divinity for that god’s help
or the wish that others do so, may follow the petition and serve also to help mo-
tivate the divinity.
Those praying may introduce themselves by name and suitable epithets in the
parts of the prayer which refer to themselves.
The expert responsible for the sequence of the petition ritual may intervene in
the prayers of petitioners or speak for the petitioners’ concerns.
Of all incantation-prayers the best attested are namburbis and Akkadian
shuillas, treated in detail below. Others served various purposes, including free-
ing a person from malignant powers or events such as sickness, demons, witch-
craft, and bad dreams. 75 One ought to recognize the apparent creativity and flu-
74
Given the continued disagreement on this issue, it is confusing when scholars offer Mayer’s
definition of an incantation-prayer in order to explain what a shuilla is. See, e.g., Sally A. L.
Butler, Mesopotamian Conceptions of Dreams and Dream Rituals (AOAT 258; Münster: Ugarit-
Verlag, 1998), 130.
75
Mayer distinguished three major sub-types of incantation-prayers: shuillas, namburbis and
prayers serving to free a person from malignant powers; beyond these he identified an array of
smaller groups, though he stressed that these should not be taken as an exhaustive listing (UFBG,
13–18). The smaller groups concern the dissolution of unclear or bad dreams, the fending off of
field pests, shigu-prayers (petitions for absolution from sin), and blessings for houses and build-
ings. Mayer did not include dingirshadibba-prayers, which are treated below, in his study, point-
ing out that they do not seem to have a unified literary form (ibid., 16–17). One class of texts for
which Mayer creates a separate listing in UFBG (432–35) but which he does not discuss as a sub-
genre of incantation-prayer in the introduction to that study are Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Assyri-
ologists coined this classifier to designate incantations addressed to materials used in rituals and
intended to activate, enhance, and elicit the qualities of the materials (Kunstmann, BGB, 80; I.
Tzvi Abusch, “Blessing and Praise in Ancient Mesopotamian Incantations,” in Literatur, Politik
und Recht in Mesopotamien: Festschrift für Claus Wilcke (ed. W. Sallaberger, K. Volk, and A. Zgoll;
Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003], 1–14, here 2). Under Mayer’s definition of the core of incanta-
tion-prayers—address of a deity with petitions—such texts could be considered incantation-
prayers if they include both of these elements and to the extent that the materials addressed are30idity with which purposes could be constructed and combined. For instance, one
namburbi is for dissolving “evil that can cling to someone because of the magi-
cal manipulations of witches” and so associates the general purpose of nambur-
bis, to dissolve evil fate, with defense against the malignant power of witchcraft
(see Maul, ZB, 445). 76 Moreover, Akkadian shuillas were in many cases carried
out in conjunction with namburbis (see Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers,
§6). Aside from namburbis, dingirshadibbas, and Akkadian shuillas, all other
incantation-prayers are referred to simply as such in the present volume.
(3) Akkadian Shuillas: Even if one accepts the position that the shuilla-rubric
marks a particular class of ritual petition-prayers of the individual, as does the
present volume, one must recognize a range of scholarly opinion regarding the
distinguishing characteristics and purpose of Akkadian shuillas. The present dis-
cussion clusters around the interpretation of four aspects of these ritual-prayers:
the shuilla-rubric; typical and distinctive characteristics of the prayers; essential
elements of the ritual activity associated with them; and the rationale and pur-
pose of these ritual-prayers as a whole.
Recognizing that the term “shuilla” refers to a gesture of greeting or prayer,
most translators either render it literally as “lifted-hand” or translate it “prayer”
or “petition-prayer.” 77 As already noted, by contrast to other rubrics that convey
more specific purposes, the prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric tend not to be as-
signed to a ritual having a specific purpose (Kunstmann, BGB). In fact, one
scholar has taken this rubric to mark a non-category of ritual-prayers, those hav-
ing no specific purpose. 78 Interpreted as “prayer” or “petition-prayer,” one could
imagine the shuilla-rubric applying to the entire genre of incantation-prayer.
However, the linguistic features of Akkadian shuilla-prayers demonstrate a
seen to represent recognized deities or personified objects. See the incantation-prayer to Salt,
page 189 in this volume.
76
On the blending of ritual function in the Akkadian shuilla Nisaba 1, see pages 350–52 in this
book.
77
In translating the rubric as “petition-prayer,” Mayer follows Franz Kraus (UFBG, 7). Zgoll
prefers the literal translation (Annette Zgoll, Die Kunst des Betens: Form und Funktion, Theologie
und Psychagogik in babylonisch-assyrischen Handerhebungsgebeten zu Ištar [AOAT 308; Münster:
Ugarit-Verlag, 2003, passim]). While stressing that the rubric marks prayers with distinctive
characteristics and not just any prayer at all, Zgoll views the shuilla-rubric as supplying an over-
arching category “prayer” when combined with other rubrics (Die Kunst des Betens, 21–22).
However, she has not taken up the issue of the distinctiveness of shuillas as a class in detail.
Frechette rejects interpretation of this rubric as synonymous with “prayer.” See his “Reconsider-
ing ŠU.IL 2 .LA (2) as a Classifier of the Āšipu in Light of the Iconography of Reciprocal Hand-Lifting
Gestures,” in Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale Held at the Oriental
Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005, (ed. R. Biggs, J. Myers, and M. Roth; SAOC
62; Chicago: Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, 2008), 39–46; and Mesopotamian
Ritual-prayers, §2.

number of distinctive tendencies as compared with the other incantation-
prayers, including the following: 79
•
•
•
They employ elevated speech befitting the formality of an audience.
They include petitions to reconcile client and personal gods.
They include petitions for health and well-being stated in general terms while
being adaptable to specific occasions. 80
The basic structure of and rationale for Akkadian shuillas manifest the concept
of an “audience,” a fundamental situation of ancient Near Eastern culture con-
cerning ceremonies for a meeting in which someone presents a request to some-
one of a higher social status. 81 Noting that other Mesopotamian ritual-prayers
also reflect such a rationale, one scholar argues that the shuilla-rubric itself of-
fers a key to the distinctive rationale for these ritual-prayers. Preferring a literal
translation of the shuilla-rubric, he interprets its idiomatic meaning as concrete-
ly grounded in a formal gesture of greeting appropriate when entering the court
of a god or king and analogous to a military salute in that it demonstrates
recognition of an asymmetrical relationship between the subordinate who offers
the gesture and the one of higher status who receives it and who may have been
understood to offer a reciprocal gesture of some kind. 82 The following schema
for Akkadian shuillas is followed by a detailed discussion of each section: 83
79
These findings of Mayer are not summarized in UFBG, but they are discussed by Frechette
(Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §4). Mayer provisionally characterized shuilla-prayers as con-
cerned in a general way with a good human condition, liberation from what is life-threatening,
and attainment of what supports life (UFBG, 13). Such characterization, however, assumes a
form-critical stance that is overly confident in the capacity of a type of text considered original
to disclose the function of a genre. In thus characterizing shuilla-prayers, he discounted the
many cases in which rather specific petitions have been added to a given exemplar.
80
Noting that many particular exemplars of the canonical form of a given prayer are adapted for
specific occasions, Frechette considers such adaptability a defining characteristic of shuillas
(Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §§4, 6, 7).

82
See Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §2. He acknowledges there that notions of prayer,
blessing, and greeting are closely related in Mesopotamian culture, as can be seen in that the
same term (karābu) can express all three. On this point, see the landmark article by Benno
Landsberger, “Das ‘gute Wort,’” in Altorientalische Studien: Bruno Meissner zum sechzigsten Geburts-
tag am 25. April 1928 (Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1928–1929), 294–321.
83
This schema and discussion represent a modification of the work of Zgoll (Die Kunst; “Audi-
enz”; and “Für Sinne, Geist und Seele: Vom konkreten Ablauf mesopotamischer Rituale zu einer
generellen Systematic von Ritualfunktionen,” in Ritual und Poesie: Formen und Orte religiöser
Dichtung im alten Orient, im Judentum und im Christentum [ed. E. Zenger; Freiburg im Breisgau:
Herder, 2003], 25–46) and that of Frechette (“Reconsidering”; and Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers).32• Setting:
o They are addressed to a single high-ranking deity (rarely to multiple deities
as a collective).
o While they could be performed as units in isolation, they were certainly
performed in immediate conjunction with other ritual procedures in many
cases.
o They usually take place outdoors at night or in early morning in order to
address the deities in their astral aspects.
• Essential Elements (to which others may be added):
o Purification of the place (often by sweeping and sprinkling with water)
o Offerings, which usually include the burning of aromatics and pouring of
libations and may include food offerings
o Hand-lifting gesture(s) and prostration or kneeling of the client
o Triple recitation of the specified text to the deity, which typically empha-
sizes an eloquent address
Rationale and Purpose:
o The rationale of reciprocity operative in an audience determined that by
accepting the offerings, gestures, and speech of the subject, the superior be-
ing addressed was to some degree obliged to respond favorably to the re-
quest for assistance. Through this ritual, one sought to (re-)establish such a
reciprocal relationship with the deity, but the deity was regarded as free to
accept or to refuse.
o The shuilla-rubric names the entire ritual by highlighting as its central ac-
tion the hand-lifting gesture, which in a condensed and apt way signals to
the deity simultaneously the client’s submission and expectation of favora-
ble recognition and response to petition.
•
Prior to discussing the specific points of this schema, it should be noted that
all ritual instructions preserved in connection with prayers should be regarded
as aids to memory rather than comprehensive or exact indicators of what was
enacted. For instance, it has been observed that some ritual actions were consid-
ered so obvious that they were taken for granted and not specified in written
instructions. 84 Where multiple copies of a specific ritual of the exorcist are pre-
served, we may observe disparity among them in the amount of detail with
which ritual instructions are given as well as differences in the elements or order
of elements included. 85 Such differences may result in some cases from the varie-
ty of purposes for which a given tablet may have been copied, for example, for
84
Stefan Maul notes that while Kultmittelbeschwörungen incantations intended to activate the
effectiveness of various materials used in rituals, e.g., water and flour, are well attested in other
rituals, they are with one exception not attested in any instructions for namburbi-rituals (ZB, 33,
n.67). He explains this omission by suggesting that such incantations were so self-evident to the
expert that they did not need to be written (ibid., 33).
85
Maul has shown that different copies of the same ritual might provide details in different
degree, from a more elaborate “handbook” style, perhaps intended to instruct the beginner, to a
much more laconic style which regarded a greater number of actions as self-evident (ibid., 96–
97).I NTRODUCTION
33
archival purposes, for enactment on a specific occasion, or within a certain ritual
context, as an amulet or votive, or as a demonstration by an apprentice that he
had mastered a given text. 86 Among those copies of shuilla-prayers containing no
ritual instructions at all, some bear colophons indicating that they were copied
for a specific ritual series. For instance, instructions citing the prayers by incipit
occur on the ritual-tablets of Bīt salāʾ mê, a ritual lasting several days for the
purification of the king that took place during the fall Babylonian New Year’s
festival. 87
Concerning the setting: Akkadian shuilla-prayers are directed primarily to
“high gods” (as opposed to “personal gods”). 88 While many shuilla-prayers in-
clude petitions for healing, they have been characterized as concerned to obtain
help in reconciling personal gods to the speaker. 89 Comparative analysis demon-
strates that petitions for intercession regarding such reconciliation occur with a
significantly higher frequency in shuilla-prayers than in other incantation-
prayers. 90 In the Bīt salāʾ mê ritual for the legitimation of the Babylonian king,
the sequence of shuilla-rituals is intended to gain the intercession of the many
high-ranking gods addressed with the king’s angry personal deities in order to
reconcile them with him. 91
All three major classes of shuillas are addressed to deities as individuals. 92
Considerable evidence demonstrates inclusion of Akkadian shuillas along-
side or within other rituals. 93 For instance, they were likely enacted routinely
with namburbis, and lengthy sequences of them are attested in elaborate royal
rituals such as Bīt salāʾ mê and Bīt rimki.
Concerning the essential elements: This organization of elements for Akkadian
shuillas is not restrictive, and much of it is not distinctive. The notion of peti-
tioning deities in the context of an audience with its necessary purificatory
preparations, offerings, gestures, and recitations may be observed in other Mes-

Zgoll describes these prayers as addressed especially to gods responsible for illness. However,
a number of the gods she cites in support of this point are addressed not in any known shuilla-
prayers but in other incantation-prayers (Die Kunst, 22, n.52 citing Nils Heeßel, Babylonisch-
assyrische Diagnostik [AOAT 43; Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, 2000], 83f.; but the note at 83, n.41

8734opotamian rituals, especially those designated as “meal or aromatic gift offer-
ings.” 94 Some Akkadian shuillas include elements not listed here, such as the
manipulation of materials (bricks, minerals, fabric) or the making of other ges-
tures (holding of objects, anointing of the client). 95
In only two extant exemplars (Nusku 7 and Ishtar 1) is it fairly clear that an
instruction specifies that a shuilla-prayer be recited in conjunction with a ges-
ture of hand-lifting. Nevertheless, in light of the rubric and of the practice of
scribes to dispense with noting obvious elements, it is likely that a gesture of
hand-lifting was assumed. 96
The instruction for a triple recitation of the text occurs in many cases and
was likely presumed. In the texts of the prayers, typically the address of the dei-
ty occupies a large portion of the total prayer and is expressed with heightened
rhetorical style. 97
Concerning the rationale and purpose: By means of this ritual-prayer one
sought to establish a reciprocal relationship with the deity addressed as was
typical of asymmetrical relationships in the ancient Near East; in such relation-
ships the one receiving the gifts, gestures, and prayers would be to some degree
obliged to respond favorably to the petitioner. 98 While the convention of reci-
procity certainly influenced perceptions of shuilla-rituals as effective for present-
ing petitions, the efficacy of Mesopotamian rituals derived primarily from their
perceived divine origin, and a favorable response to petitions included in them
could not be presumed. 99

potamien,” RlA 10 (2003–2005), 93–102, §7.2. Of the types of prayer included in the present
volume, this listing includes namburbis.
95
Zgoll’s discussion lists the burning of aromatics as an essential element separate from the
offering of libations and possibly foods (“Für Sinne,” 29–30). However, one well-attested, laconic
formula simply instructs either the setting up of a ritual arrangement (riksu) or a censer (nignak-
ku). Such an option is attested at least once in exemplars of fourteen different shuilla-prayers.
Since riksu here likely refers to an array of ritual paraphernalia including the censer, this formula
leaves open the possibility that in some cases only incense was offered. For discussion of this
instruction, see Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §5.
96
For a detailed discussion of the significance of the rubric and its implications for the ritual
activity accompanying these shuilla-prayers, see ibid., §§2, 3, 5. The gesture of lifted hand(s) is
mentioned in neither Zgoll’s discussion of the function of the procedures and words in these
rituals (“Für Sinne,” 27–43) nor in her sketch of the structure and elements of these rituals (“Au-
dienz,” 183–87). However, her comparison of the elements of shuilla-rituals with those of an
audience with a human ruler as portrayed in The Poor Man of Nippur asserts that such a gesture
was enacted and gave the ritual its name (“Audienz,” 189–97).

Claus Ambos offers the following summary of the operative worldview:
Mesopotamian techniques of ritual and divination were believed to have been trans-
mitted to man by the gods themselves, and they could never work against the will of
the gods nor force them to perform an action merely because it was desired by the
ritual’s human participants. The reason is that ritual was not effective in itself but de-I NTRODUCTION
35
The shuilla-rubric names the ritual by highlighting the hand-lifting gesture
as a central action, one likely presumed by the exorcists, and the rationale for
highlighting this gesture may be summarized as follows: 100 A gesture of lifted
hands expressed by terms corresponding to the shuilla-rubric is instructed for
various rituals, but for this one it was of central significance. That an element
occurring in various rituals could be the classifying rubric of a particular ritual
for which it held such significance is otherwise attested. 101 While offerings and
speech were essential to an audience, Akkadian shuillas emphasized the com-
municative gesture to which the shuilla-rubric refers, a salutation signaling
recognition of a reciprocal but asymmetrical relationship between client and
deity. 102 Given the lexical and visual evidence that such greetings were ex-
changed in a reciprocal manner, this gesture would have provided a particularly
apt ritual focus for expressing both the desire to (re-)establish such a relationship
with the deity and the anticipation of the deity’s acceptance of this relationship
and favorable response to the petitions presented. As already noted, the propor-
tion of text dedicated to formal address of the deity typically occupies up to half
of the text of the prayer. These shuilla-prayers did convey petitions and were
often recited in conjunction with other prayers expressing petitions, but their
ritual designation highlighted this formal gesture of greeting. In so doing, the
ritual focused on an action which in a condensed and apt way signaled to the
deity simultaneously the client’s willing submission and expectation of favorable
recognition and help. In this way, the petitions associated with these shuillas
were explicitly contextualized by this gesture which affirmed an asymmetrical
yet reciprocal relationship between petitioner and deity.
Additional specifications of purpose within either rubrics or ritual instruc-
tions, while rare, are attested among exemplars of Akkadian shuilla-prayers.
These may be seen as explicit statements of context within which the assistance
of the deity addressed was sought. 103
pended upon the gods’ collaboration. This concept could also account for occasional
ritual failure: the gods simply were refusing any communication with the human
sphere and were not inclined to accept a prayer or a ritual.
(“Ritual Healing and the Investiture of the Babylonian King,” in The Problem of Ritual Efficacy
[ed. W. Sax, J. Quack, J. Weinhold; New York: Oxford University Press, 2010], 17–44, here 17).
100
This explanation of this rationale follows Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §§ 3, 7.
101
A particular ritual element, even one commonly attested among various rituals, was em-
ployed in some cases to name a particular ritual for which that element captured the central
significance. Claus Ambos discusses how this is the case for the sprinkling rite central to the Bīt
salāʾ mê, “house of sprinkling,” ritual as well as for the “mouthwashing” central to the Mīs pî
ritual, “mouth-washing” (Der König, §II.3.2). See also Dick, “Pīt Pī,” 581–82).
102
As noted above, these shuilla-rituals were addressed, like those of the other two recognized
classes mentioned above, almost exclusively to individual high-ranking deities.

Omens were important indicators of the will of the gods for the ancient
Mesopotamians and could manifest themselves in anything that was a) deemed
significant in their system of divination and b) observed by someone. Solicited
omens were obtained through human actions intent on finding signs as, for ex-
ample, in the case of liver divination (i.e., hepatoscopy, sacrificing an animal
and examining its liver to interpret the signs the gods had placed on it). Unsolic-
ited omens could take the form of a host of things one might observe in the
course of everyday life. Certain signs were deemed unfavorable and others were
favorable. The description of signs and their significance was expressed in an “if-
then” statement and recorded on tablets. The “if” clause is technically called the
protasis by scholars; the “then” clause is called the apodosis. In the course of
time, scribes compiled long lists of omens and arranged them thematically into
tablet series such as Shumma Alu, dealing with terrestrial omens, Shumma Izbu,
dealing with malformed births, and Enuma Anu Enlil, dealing with celestial
omens. It was believed that before a calamity happened, the gods might an-
nounce it with an evil omen. 105 The shape of a malformed animal fetus, the ap-
pearance of a lizard on the wall in one’s house, the movement of a planet, the
content of a dream—these and many, many other things could be understood as
104
Despite its size, Maul’s volume does not contain all known namburbi-rituals. He states that
his interpretations are based on both the published editions and on about two hundred other
namburbi-ritual fragments known to him (ZB, XII, n.11). Unfortunately, he does not list these
fragments systematically anywhere in the volume.
105
Not all omens were evil, however; some were interpreted as favorable. In the case of evil
omens counteracted by namburbi-rituals, Maul suggests that the Mesopotamians understood the
impending evil to have been the result of a human misdeed, committed by the one affected by
the omen, that had angered the gods (see “How the Babylonians Protected Themselves,” 124 and
ZB, 60).I NTRODUCTION
37
unsolicited evil signs. 106 According to Maul, these things are omen bearers; they
bore the evil of the omen to the person affected. 107
Despite the announcement of coming calamity, the one affected by the evil
omen did not have to resign themselves to its ravages. The execution of a nam-
burbi-ritual, performed by the exorcist for and with the person affected—often
the king but others as well, would avert the impending ill announced by an evil
omen before it happened and thereby return the affected person to normal
life. 108 Attested rituals counteract many different kinds of evil, as a perusal of
Maul’s table of contents will show (see ZB, VI–VII). For example, there are ritu-
als against evil omens associated with the behavior or specific observations of
birds, snakes, dogs, lizards, ants, and other animals, against the observation of
lightning, against the appearance of fungus in a house, against a specific time of
a child’s birth, against a lunar eclipse, and against chariot accidents while on
campaign, among others. The namburbi-ritual could be quite short or be carried
out over several days. If one is to judge from the ritual accoutrement involved
(e.g., precious metals, a host of food and drink offerings, and the fabrication of
figurines), some of the namburbi-rituals would have been very expensive and
taken days to prepare. 109 Whatever its cost, without a ritual response to release
or undo the evil portended by the omen, the evil that was announced, so it was
thought, would become a reality.
Namburbi-prayers comprise the class of incantation-prayer recited during
namburbi-rituals for the specific purpose, as the name suggests (the Sum. word
nam-búr-bi means “its releasing”), 110 of releasing the announced evil so it would
not actually harm the person affected by the appearance of the omen. 111 Not

There is much, much more to say about divination in ancient Mesopotamia. For a concise
overview, see A. K. Grayson, “Divination,” in Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide, 373–76 and
Jean Bottéro, Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods (trans. Zainab Bahrani and Marc van
de Mieroop; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 125–37. A much fuller treatment is
presented in Stefan Maul, “Omina und Orakel. A. Mesopotamien,” RlA 10 (2003–2005), 45–88. It
should be noted that the omen collections were not merely observation-based collections. Ra-
ther, they underwent scholastic development and therefore often contain signs that would be
highly unlikely or impossible to ever observe (e.g., a seven-headed izbu or a lunar eclipse on,
say, the fifth day of a lunar month).
107
For a summary of Maul’s view of the “omen bearers,” see pages 357 and 407.
108
That namburbi-rituals fell within the professional and institutional domain of the exorcist is
clear from KAR 44, rev. 6 (and parallels), the so-called Vademecum of the Exorcist, where nam-
burbi-rituals are listed among the texts an exorcist must master. See M. J. Geller, “Incipits and
Rubrics” in Wisdom, Gods, and Literature: Studies in Assyriology in Honour of W. G. Lambert (ed. A.
R. George and I. L. Finkel; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 225–58 for the most recent edition.
109
See Maul, ZB, 29–36 for a presentation of what can be gleaned about ritual preparations from
the royal correspondence of Neo-assyrian scholars and 39–47 for his reconstruction of prepara-
tions from the ritual instructions.
110
The Sumerian suffix –bi, “its,” in the name originally referred to the omen apodosis, the
“then” part of the omen entry that asserted the significance of the observed sign (see Maul, ZB,
12).
111
Although releasing evil was the usual purpose of namburbi-rituals, a very small minority
were intended for a positive purpose. For example, we have namburbi-rituals to bring about an38every namburbi-ritual required a namburbi-prayer, however, 112 and other kinds
of prayers may also have been required during the course of the ritual (e.g.,
shuilla-prayers and cult-material incantation-prayers or Kultmittelbeschwörung-
en). 113 When a prayer was prescribed by the ritual instructions—namburbi or
otherwise, it might appear as a full text embedded in the broader ritual context.
Sometimes, however, the instructions only cited the incipit, that is, the prayer’s
initial line; the remainder of the prayer would have been provided by the exor-
cist performing the ritual, presumably from memory or from another tablet.
A namburbi-prayer was only one part in a rather complex ritual process,
which is briefly summarized here in an idealized form. 114 After the exorcist pre-
pared the items needed for the ritual (e.g., holy water and figurines) and erected
an altar, 115 the people and places 116 involved in the ritual would be purified
(e.g., the one affected by the omen may wash in water). An offering of various
foods and drinks, which in fact constituted a meal, would be presented to the
gods involved in the ritual, typically Shamash, Ea, and Asalluḫi. 117 Incense may
also be burned during the meal. 118 With the preparations made for approaching
the gods and the mood for a favorable hearing achieved, the heart of the ritual
began: the removal of the impending evil from the one affected by the evil sign.
It is at this point in the ritual that the prayer would have been recited.
increase in trade for a business owner or other professional (see Caplice, Akkadian Namburbi
Texts, 9 and 23–24) and to overcome the estrangement of a couple who had been separated for a
time (see ZB, 409–14).
112
This point is easily verified by perusing the examples translated in Caplice, Akkadian Nam-
burbi Texts. As with all ritual instructions, however, the possibility must be considered that not
everything that was to be done in a namburbi-ritual was actually written on the tablet. In some
cases, the ritual instructions may have presumed the exorcist knew what (else) there was to do.
113
For the incorporation of the shuilla-prayer, Sin 1, into a namburbi against the evil of a lunar
eclipse, see page 386, n.7 and the references there. For cult-material prayer-incantations, as
stated earlier, we must presume they were recited during namburbi-rituals from memory by the
exorcist since they were not incorporated into the actual instructions (with one exception). See
Maul’s statements in ZB, 33 with n.67, 107 with n.8, and 375, 377, line 12ʹh for the exception).
114
This summary is idealized because not every element in it is attested in every namburbi-
ritual, and there is no attempt here at an exhaustive listing of the great variety in ritual details.
For the variety of ritual actions, see Maul’s thorough treatment in ibid., 39–113 and the much
briefer overview in Caplice, Akkadian Namburbi Texts, 9–12.
115
See ZB, 39–47.
116
The ritual could take place in a variety of settings such as the roof of a house, the bank of a
canal, or where the omen manifested itself. But it is not uncommon for the instructions to de-
scribe the location only vaguely: a secluded place in the steppe (ina ṣēri parsi) or some other
inaccessible locale (ašar šēpu parsat, lit. “a place where the foot is barred”; see ibid., 48).
117
See ibid., 48–59.
118
Caplice, remarking on the burning of aromatics, writes, “it is clear that burning them on a
censer was part of the normal banquet situation among human beings in the Neo-Assyrian peri-
od, so that their use in rituals providing a divine banquet was natural” (Akkadian Namburbi
Texts, 11). Note also the similarity to the meal-related activities as described in the OB ikribu-
like prayer, line 11ff. (see page 90).I NTRODUCTION
39
Formally, namburbi-prayers follow the typical outline of other incantation-
prayers. 119 That is, they begin with an invocation and praise of the deity or dei-
ties involved. As noted above, Shamash, god of justice, is the god predominantly
invoked, often along with Ea and Asalluḫi, gods of wisdom and magic. 120 The
reason for this, according to Maul, is that
[e]ven if the great gods Ea, Šamaš, and Asalluhi, whom the conjuror had sum-
moned, were not the divinities who had sent the . . . omen, they had at the very
least allowed the person to be burdened with that fate. Only when the person
involved had convinced the gods, especially Šamaš, the god of law (kittu) and
justice (mīšaru), that the impending, evil fate would befall him unjustly, could
the sinister power of the harbinger . . . be broken. 121
After the introduction, the prayers turn to a description of the problem (lament)
and the request for its resolution (petition). The lament often includes a descrip-
tion of the sign (ina/aššu lumun X, “on account of the evil of X”) and how it af-
fected the supplicant, typically stated as palḫāku adrāka u šutādurāku, “I am
afraid, anxious, and constantly in fear.” 122 The petition part of the namburbi-
prayer is invariably concerned with requesting the deity to avert the impending
evil from the supplicant and to make the evil keep its distance. The prayers gen-
erally conclude with a brief promise of praise.
The ritual instructions typically complement the petitions of the prayer via
the actions prescribed against the omen bearer or, as is often the case, its substi-
tute in the form of a figurine. 123 The evil was transferred symbolically to the
omen bearer/substitute in some way (e.g., the water used to purify the suppli-
cant was poured over the omen bearer) 124 and then eliminated (e.g., the omen
bearer or its substitute was tossed into the river, placed on a boat going down-
stream, or carried off by a fish or bird). 125 After another rite of purification, 126
the supplicant might be told, for example, to return home, go to another place,
or to enter a tavern, being careful not to look back or to return on the same path
by which they had come. 127 Sometimes the supplicant would also be required to
wear an amulet necklace for a prescribed number of days. 128
119
In fact, Mayer (UFBG, 35) uses a namburbi-prayer, Shamash 25 (see page 421) as an example
of the typical structure of an incantation-prayer in the introduction to his study.
120
Other gods could be invoked in prayers, too (e.g., Naru, “the deified River,” and Ishtar).
121
“How the Babylonians Protected Themselves,” 125.
122
Although other incantation-prayers use these formulae, they are found very frequently in
namburbi-prayers. See Mayer, UFBG, 73–74.
123
As Maul mentions, a few namburbis require the use of a figurine of the one affected by the
omen—the supplicant themselves. This substitute then receives the evil and symbolically suffers
its effects instead of the real person. See ZB, 74–75.

ning on 76.

128
See ibid., 107–13.40As one might surmise from the prominence of Shamash, god of justice, in
the ritual recitations, namburbi-rituals are permeated with legal language. De-
spite the legal imagery’s importance, it is probably overstepping the bounds of
evidence to suggest, as does Maul, that the namburbi-ritual is patterned exclu-
sively on a legal trial, 129 ending with a river ordeal for the evil bearer. 130 As
Veldhuis points out, the legal imagery is an important perspective to keep in
mind while interpreting the namburbis but not all examples fit this model as
well as others. 131 For example, not all namburbis end with the evil bearer being
cast into the river (see Maul, ZB, 89–90). Moreover, focus on the legal aspects
may lead to neglecting other useful perspectives.
Although there are a couple of Akkadian and Hittite tablets from Hattusha
that preserve rituals of releasing evil, suggesting OB forerunners for namburbi-
ritual texts, by far our most numerous sources for namburbi-rituals come from
first millennium sites in Babylonia and Assyria and are written in SB Akkadi-
an. 132 The textual witnesses to namburbi-rituals come down to us in various
forms: some rituals appear in the omen tablets themselves as a brief insertion
after the related omens that the namburbi-ritual counteracts; a couple of rituals
are part of a larger medical-ritual compendium that includes various other texts;
many namburbi-rituals are preserved individually on a tablet, one ritual per
tablet; others are transmitted on Sammeltafeln, that is, tablets that collect a num-
ber of namburbi-rituals, which may or may not be thematically organized; final-
ly, some namburbi-rituals are preserved on amulets, suggesting that even the
inscribed tablet itself had apotropaic effectiveness. 133 According to Maul, evi-
dence suggests that namburbi-rituals were arranged into a series of at least 136
tablets for Ashurbanipal’s library. Unfortunately, evidence is currently too sparse
to reconstruct the series. 134 Letters from Assyrian and Babylonian scholars to the
king, however, provide important evidence for the preparation and actual execu-
tion of namburbi-rituals in the Assyrian capital. 135

Comparative Study. Assen: Van Gorcum, 1985, 121–24. {A brief look at the ritual set-
ting and purpose of these prayers.} Margaret Jaques at the University of Zurich is
publishing a fuller edition and study of the dingirshadibbas, including the prayers and
their rituals. Her study will also address their reception history and reuse, too.
Dingirshadibba-prayers take their name from the Sum. rubric that some-
times occurs at their conclusion: ka-inim-ma dingir-šà-dib-ba gur-ru-da-kam, “it
is the wording for appeasing (lit. turning back) an angry god.” 136 Because the
wording of the prayer is often preceded by the én superscript modern scholars
refer to them as incantation-prayers. As the name dingirshadibba suggests, these
incantation-prayers were used for penitential purposes; that is, they were prayed
when one needed to turn back the wrath of a god. Like the other Akkadian in-
cantation-prayers discussed above, the dingirshadibba-prayers were part of the
professional sphere of the exorcist (see KAR 44, obv. 4 and parallels). 137 Themat-
ically, the dingirshadibbas are not distinctive since several other kinds of prayers
were also intended to appease the anger of various gods (e.g., ershaḫunga-
prayers 138 and the still rather poorly known shigu-prayers 139 ). What is distinctive
about the dingirshadibba-prayers is the deity to whom they were typically di-
rected: the personal deity. 140 (For more on personal deities, see page 431.)
Because the supplicant was quite familiar with the addressee, many of the
dingirshadibba-prayers have a more intimate and personal tone than the other
kinds of prayers in this volume. The opening may exemplify this tone best. 141
Rather than beginning the prayer with an invocation and a long string of epi-
thets that invoke, honor, and praise the deity being addressed, the dingirsha-
dibba-prayers typically begin with a very short invocation, sometimes as simple
136
The rubric does not occur in all of the examples that Lambert reconstructed. Some of the
prayers he treats in his edition were classified as dingirshadibba-prayers by content alone. His
edition, as he states, is tentative (“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 267). Jaques reads the third
sign of the prayer’s name as dab (see the lexical section of ṣabātu in CAD Ṣ, 6), thus, dingir-šà-
dab-ba. The meaning is, however, the same.
137
See footnote 108 above for the most recent edition of this text.
138
In fact, Lambert has shown that some texts he edits as dingirshadibbas were also known in
the form of bilingual and unilingual Sumerian ershaḫunga-prayers. See his lines 71–108 (“DING-
IR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 278–81, 288–93, and 297–304) and Maul, HB, 213–15. For more on
ershaḫunga-prayers, see page 43 below.
139
See Mayer, UFBG, 15 for the handful of prayers that falls into this small category and his
pages 111–13 for their characteristic features. The most recent treatment, with references to
literature since Mayer, is van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia, 117–21, with
a few texts treated in 125–36. See also the earlier work by M.-J. Seux, “Šiggayôn = šigû?” in
Mélanges bibliques et orientaux en l’honneur de M. Henri Cazelles (ed. A. Caquot and M. Delcor;
AOAT 212; Kevelaer: Butzon & Bercker / Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1981), 419–38.
140
As Lambert notes, the rubric is not applied in an entirely consistent manner to generic per-
sonal gods since occasionally a dingirshadibba-prayer addresses a high god such as Sin or Mar-
duk and Zarpanitu (“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 268).
141
See Alan Lenzi, “Invoking the God: Interpreting Invocations in Mesopotamian Prayers and
Biblical Laments of the Individual,” JBL 129 (2010), 303–15.42as “my god” (ilī). When other epithets follow they often have some personal
connection to the supplicant. Lines 40–41 of Lambert’s provisional edition of the
dingirshadibbas provide a notable example in this respect, though the opening is
longer than is usual: ilī bēlī bānû šumīya nāṣir napištīya mušabšû zērīya, “my god,
my lord, ‘builder’ of my name, guardian of my life, creator of my progeny.” 142
Unlike the other classes of incantation-prayers, the dingirshadibba-prayers
do not show a common structure, although laments, petitions, and, in a few cas-
es, a promise of praise can be found variously in the prayers. Thematically, ding-
irshadibba-prayers are focused on the supplicant’s personal sin. Both confession
of sin and pleas of ignorance (in general and about sin specifically) dominate the
prayers, finding expression in direct statements (e.g., mādū arnūya ēma ēpušu ul
īde, “my iniquities are many! I do not know what I did!”), 143 questions (e.g., mīnu
annūya kīam epšēku, “what are my sins (that) I am treated thus?”), 144 and meta-
phors (e.g., alpu anākū-ma šammu ākulu ul īde, “I am an ox; I do not know the
plant that I eat.”). 145 One also finds various statements that assert the inherent
sinfulness of humanity and the remoteness of the divine realm, suggesting that
because sin is inevitable and the deity so remote human frailties should be ex-
cused. 146
We do not know whether the dingirshadibba-prayers were arranged into a
series as were the namburbis in Nineveh. There is at present no published colo-
phon evidence to go on. We do know, however, that the prayers were used with
various ritual actions 147 and in various ritual settings. As the evidence is still
rather thin, a fuller treatment of the ritual setting of these prayers must await
Margaret Jaques’ new edition in her Habilitation at the University of Zurich.
Lambert mentions the incorporation of dingirshadibba-prayers into Bīt rimki and
their apparent use in a ritual preserved on KAR 90 (which was followed by
Šurpu); but he was reticent to discuss the ritual setting of the dingirshadibbas
further because the evidence was “too incomplete and uncertain in every respect
for any overall view to be obtained.” 148 Karel van der Toorn offers a brief discus-
sion of some of the diverse occasions for the performance of these incantation-
prayers in the hopes that understanding “[t]he ritual Sitz im Leben of the indi-
vidual prayers may . . . furnish the key to a better comprehension of their place
in the more elaborate rituals” 149 (such as Bīt rimki). He believes the dingirsha-
dibbas were “designed for situations in which the general circumstances point to

the wrath of the personal gods,” 150 which is supported by the citation of a ding-
irshadibba in what he believes are diagnostic texts. After looking at some shared
terminology in the prayers and the diagnostic texts, he concludes that “the dingi-
ršadibbas with their rather vague rubrics represent the therapeutic counterpart of
the diagnostic texts.” 151 Sally Butler has noticed that prayers very similar to the
dingirshadibba-prayers (though the dingirshadibba-rubric is lacking) are pre-
scribed in what she calls the Ashur Dream Ritual Compendium, col. iv, lines 21–
30 and 31–41b. 152 These sections of the compendium are intended to induce a
pleasant dream (see lines 30 and 41b). Apparently, one impediment to a pleas-
ant dream was the anger of personal deities. Thus, it seems that the prayers were
used in this case to reconcile the gods to the supplicant prior to their going to
sleep.

An ershaḫunga-prayer (Sum. ér-šà-ḫun-gá), 155 as the name indicates, is a
“lament to appease the heart (of a god).” Although these prayers were originally
written in the Emesal dialect of Sumerian, most of the texts were provided with
an Akkadian interlinear translation. 156 The ershaḫunga-prayers show various
affinities with the Sumerian balags and ershemmas, 157 but they do not address

This brief introduction relies on Maul’s (HB, 1–72). The name of the prayer is always written
logographically in Akkadian contexts. Maul believes the loanword was probably more likely
written as eršaḫungakku than eršaḫungû (see ibid., 1, n.1 and compare CDA, 79).

15144political concerns or lament the destruction of a sanctuary. They, rather, are
spoken by an individual with personal concerns, ultimately, to appease an angry
god. Thematically, therefore, ershaḫunga-prayers are very similar to the ding-
irshadibbas. The ershaḫungas differ conspicuously, however, from the ding-
irshadibba-prayers in several respects: the ershaḫunga-prayers belong to the
corpus of the cult-singer (kalû), they do not begin with the én superscript, they
show a common structure, and they are not exclusively directed to the personal
god.
Maul’s edition of the ershaḫungas presents the text of over one hundred for-
ty different prayers, many of which are fragmentary. 158 Although the divine ad-
dressee of some of these prayers is impossible to determine due to damage on
the tablet, there are prayers attested for many well-known high deities such as
Anu, Aya, Ishtar, Enlil, Ninlil, Nusku, Damkina, Ea, Sin, Shamash, Marduk, Ni-
nurta, Zarpanitum, and Tashmetum, among others, as well as prayers to other
gods, such as the ones directed to a personal god 159 and to “any god” (included
in this volume, see page 447). Although the form goes back to OB times, 160 most
of the currently known prayers come from the first millennium and were discov-
ered in the remains of Ashurbanipal’s library in Nineveh, though other sites have
yielded some prayers, too. 161
The ershaḫunga-prayers exhibit a common structure. 162 Each prayer begins
with an introductory litany, which has four thematic variations: 163 praise (e.g.,
bēlum puluḫtaka galtat, qarrādu abu Adad puluḫtaka galtat “O lord, your terror is
frightening! O hero, father Adad, your terror is frightening!”); 164 wooing (e.g.,
anāku ana bēlīya taṣlītum luqbīšu, qarrādu abu Adad taṣlītum luqbīšu, “I will speak
a prayer to my lord, the hero, father Adad, I will speak a prayer!”); 165 petitioning
(e.g., ša bēlim nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra, “may the anger of the lord’s heart

158
Due to their partial preservation, some of these prayers may turn out to belong to another
genre.

Lambert treated the text as a dingirshadibba-prayer, but he also recognized that some MSS
labeled the text an ershaḫunga (see footnote 138 above).

See Maul, HB, 9–10 for a short list of OB prayers with close affinities to the first millennium’s
ershaḫunga-prayers. See also his edition of BM 29632 (with references to the secondary litera-
ture, 10–15), which bears the ershaḫunga rubric. (The tablet was originally recognized and pub-
lished by Piotr Michalowski, “On the Early History of the Ershahunga Prayer,” JCS 39 [1987],
37–48. On the basis of this tablet, Michalowski proposed to identify a number of OB prayers as
ershaḫungas [42–43]).

return to normal” [or “relent,” lit. “return to its place”], see page 449), 166 or
lamenting (e.g., anāku ana bēltīya mīnâ ēpuš, “what have I done to my lady?”). 167
The lament follows this opening litany and occupies a prominent place in
the text. The lament typically describes the effect of suffering upon the suppli-
cant’s body but details are usually lacking, making the prayers applicable to
many situations. According to Maul’s interpretation of the laments, “the de-
scribed symptoms such as tears, tremors, moans, sleeplessness, debilitation,
grief, and depression are not to be seen as the actual complaint, but rather as
secondary evils.” 168 These symptoms are the results of something deeper, name-
ly, the supplicant’s offense against the deity. Thus, one finds confessions of sin
(and ignorance) and requests for forgiveness in the lament section of the er-
shaḫungas, which often look similar to what one finds in the dingirshadibba-
prayers (see above, page 40). In the transition between the lament and the peti-
tion one may find the description of a ritual act of the supplicant similar to what
Mayer calls a Hinwendung, a “turning” 169 (e.g., kneeling, calling out, kissing the
feet of the deity, etc.). In conjunction with the supplicant’s confession of sin,
these acts often have a penitential character. 170
The petition follows upon the lament, as it does in the incantation-prayers.
In this section the supplicant calls upon the deity to remedy the breach in their
relationship and to bring the supplicant’s suffering to an end. It is common for
this section to begin with a mention of the word that the supplicant wishes the
deity to speak, the word that could put an end to the supplicant’s tribulation:
aḫulap, “(it is) enough!” Like the incantation-prayers, the supplicant may peti-
tion the deity for forgiveness of sins, renewed attention, and/or restoration of
health and well-being. 171 Between the petition and the next section, the interces-
sory litany, many ershaḫunga-prayers have a promise of praise.
In the intercessory litany the supplicant calls on their personal deities as
well as deities related to or associated with the primary deity invoked in the
prayer (e.g., if Enlil is invoked, one will find Ninlil, his wife, and Nusku, his vi-
zier, called upon in this section, among others). 172 The supplicant seeks the help
of these other gods in securing the divine appeasement of the primary deity ad-
dressed in the prayer, sometimes requesting that the intercessory deities speak a
prayer on the supplicant’s behalf.

16746The final section is aptly called the “concluding formula” (Die Eršaḫunga-
Schlußformel) and appears in all but one ershaḫunga-prayer treated by Maul (the
exception is his no. 47). It reads in Sumerian as follows:
šà-zu šà-ama-tu-ud-da-gim ki-bi-šè ḫa-am-gi 4 -gi 4
ama-tu-ud-da a-a-tu-ud-da-gim ki-bi-šè ḫa-am-gi 4 -gi 4
The Akkadian translation, when provided, reads thus: 173
libbaka kīma libbi ummi ālittim ana ašrīšu litūra
kīma ummi ālitti abi ālidi ana ašrīšu litūra
May your heart, like the heart of the mother who gave birth (to me) return to
normal,
Like the mother who gave birth (to me), the father who engendered (me), may
it return to normal.
The prayers currently attested are written on one-column tablets with one
prayer per tablet. There are no ritual instructions included on the tablets attest-
ing ershaḫunga-prayers. However, there are other tablets consisting of ritual
instructions that prescribe the use of ershaḫunga-prayers in various ritual com-
plexes. These ritual instructions often include the recitation of balags and
ershemmas before the recitation of the ershaḫunga-prayers. 174 The ritual texts
have both cultic and apotropaic purposes. The latter, according to NA letters
from scholars, are always connected to the king. It seems plausible to presume,
however, based on the individualistic content of the prayers, that the prayers
may have (also?) been used, originally, at least, by private citizens. But there is
currently no evidence to support this.

The Akk. term ikribu is often used as a generic term for prayer (see CAD I/J,
62, 65–66). Due to its distinctive employment in the rubrics of divinatory ritual
texts, however, the term has also come to designate a specific kind of prayer of
the diviner. As Ivan Starr describes it,

related OB texts, see Foster, 207–13; Seux, 467–71; and von Soden, 274–75.

[t]he term ikribu must be understood within a ritual setting: it is bound
with the acts accompanying each step of the diviner’s ritual activities in the
course of performing an extispicy. The ikribu forms an integral part of such
a set of rituals. This suggests the following definition: an ikribu is a prayer
organically bound with each particular step in the ritual activities of the di-
viner, and recited by him in the course of performing an extispicy. 176
Note, however, that the term is not always employed in a consistent manner by
Assyriologists. It has been extended by some scholars to other prayers of the
diviner that contain content similar to the ikribu-prayers yet do not bear the
ikribu-rubric (see page 85). 177
As Starr’s comments have already shown, the ikribu-prayers are embedded
in a broader ritual text/performance—indicated sometimes explicitly by the sur-
rounding ritual instructions on the tablet or only implicitly by the content of the
prayer itself or the sequence in which several prayers are ordered. Throughout
the course of the ikribu-ritual the diviner prepares and performs in a series of
steps the ritual slaughter of the animal used for divination (i.e., extispicy). For
each step of the ritual process an ikribu-text may contain ritual instructions
about the diviner’s actions and/or an indication of the appropriate ritual word-
ing (prayer) that accompanies the actions. When the text of a prayer is given on
the tablet, the purpose of the prayer is identified with a rubric, ikrib X, in which
X stands for the ritual action of a particular step in the larger ritual process. For
example, Zimmern, BBR, no. 95, a fragmentary tablet, preserves five rubrics (see
lines 2, 12, 20, 25, and 31) to five different ikribu-prayers preserved (partially)
on the tablet. 178 There are no ritual instructions surrounding the prayers, but the
five rubrics clearly outline various ritual steps in the process of an extispicy:
2. [ikrib] ina surti [bīni nadê], “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the setting
down of a circle of tamarisk wood.”
12. [ikrib kalli upunta 179 mullî-ma] kunni, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the
filling and setting out of a bowl of flour.”
176
Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 45. Ikrib is W. G. Lambert’s preferred designation, as mentioned in
an oral communication to the Würzburg Rencontre Assryiologique Internationale in 2008 (per-
sonal communication, Christopher Frechette) and utilized in his work on the tamitu-prayers (see,
e.g., Babylonian Oracle Questions, 12). He argues that because the construct form is always used
in the rubric, that form of the word should be the name of this class of the diviners’ prayers.
177
See, e.g., Mayer, UFBG, 32, n.63, who lists some (OB) texts that do not have the rubric to-
gether with ones that do bear it. (The list is now out-dated.) See also L. de Meyer, “Deux prières
ikribu du Temps d’Assmī-ṣaduqa,” in Zikir Šumim: Assyriological Studies Presented to F. R. Kraus on
the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday (ed. G. van Driel, Th. J. H. Krispijn, M. Stol, and K. R.
Veenhof; Leiden: Brill, 1982), 271–78, who uses the label ikribu for two OB prayers that do not
actually bear the rubric. (See likewise the mention of a third prayer at 271, n.7.)
178
Line 32 seems to begin a sixth prayer.
179
Zimmern, BBR, 210 reads upuntu (also written upumtu) here while CAD (e.g., K, 83) reads
maḫaṣtu. Both words denote some kind of flour.4820. [ikrib erēni ina upun]ti zuqqupi (or sukkupi), “an ikribu-prayer that accompa-
nies the setting up(?) 180 of cedar in flour.”
25. [ikrib nignakka] pēnta mullî-ma kunni, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the
filling of a censor with charcoal and setting (it) out.”
31. [ikrib p]uḫādi ḫuppi, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the purifying of the
lamb.”
The fact that these prayers are to be recited sequentially within a broader ritual
is demonstrated by another ikribu-text that preserves ritual instructions prescrib-
ing a series of recitations of ikribu-prayers and their associated ritual actions, all
of which precisely match the sequence above (see BBR, nos. 75–78: 22–29). 181
Ikribu-prayers typically begin with the invocation of Shamash and Adad, the
gods of extispicy, though other deities could be invoked, too (e.g., Ninurta as the
star Sirius, 182 Ishtar of Nineveh, and Sin). The wording of the invocation of Sha-
mash and Adad is almost always the same: Šamaš bēl dīnim u Adad bēl bīri, “O
Shamash, lord of judgment, Adad, lord of divination.” 183 The middle section of
the prayers contains statements and petitions appropriate to whatever ritual
actions are being prescribed. The most important theme in this section is ac-
ceptance of the diviner’s ritual actions. The prayers do not end with praise as
many of the prayers discussed so far. Rather, they tend to conclude with very
formulaic petitionary phrases that lay emphasis on the central concern of the
ritual as a whole. For example, YOS 11 23, a long OB text preserving a number
of ikribu-prayers, preserves the following concluding formula in several brief
prayers near the tablet’s end: ina imitti puḫādim annîm kittam u šumēl puḫādim
annîm kittam šuknān, “in the right of this lamb (place) truth, and the left of this
lamb place truth” (see lines 137, 140, 142). Similarly, the first millennium ikri-
bu-prayers conclude—when a conclusion is preserved—with the following for-
mula: Šamaš u Adad izizzānim-ma ina qibītīya nīš qātīya ina mimma mala eppušu
tamīt akarrabu kitta libši, “O Shamash and Adad, stand here that in my speaking,
the lifting of my hands, whatever I do, the query that I pray there may be truth!”
This final petition for the gods to place truth (kittu), an idea that arises quite
180
The meaning of zuqqupu or sukkupu is uncertain (see CAD Z, 54).
The same five prayers, referenced by rubric only (the text is not given), appear in the same
order in Zimmern, BBR, no. 96: 6–10.
182
For a new edition of the Ninurta as Sirius prayer, see now Werner R. Mayer, “Das Gebet des
Eingeweideschauers an Ninurta,” Or n.s. 74 (2005), 51–56 (reference courtesy of Christopher
Frechette).
183
There are exceptions to this invocation, however. See, e.g., YOS 11 23:1 (= HSM 7494),
edited by Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 25–106, specifically 30, and AO 7032: 1, given in copy by
Jean Nougayrol, “Textes hépatoscopiques d’époque ancienne conserves au Musée du Louvre,” RA
38 (1941), 67–88, specifically 87, transliterated by Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 122. Both of these
read: Šamaš bēl dīnim u Adad bēl ikribī u bīri, “O Shamash, lord of judgment, Adad, lord of ex-
tispicy-rituals and divination.” See the same additional epithet throughout the ikribu-related OB
prayer of the diviner, beginning on page 85.
181I NTRODUCTION
49
frequently in the ikribu-prayers and others associated with them, 184 is the central
purpose of both the ikribu-prayer as well as the entire ritual of extispicy. By
asking the deities to “place truth” the diviner intends to make an “appeal for the
manifestation of the oracular verdict,” 185 an accurate and trustworthy indication
of the will of the gods in the exta of the animal.
Unfortunately, the current state of publication of the ikribu-prayers does not
allow us to discuss issues of standardization or the arrangement of the prayers in
a series. It is hoped that W. G. Lambert’s promised edition will shed light on
such issues.

Although there is still some question about the precise meaning of the term,
Akk. tamītu is understood by Lambert to mean “oracle question.” 186 Despite this
name, there is no reason to exclude the tamitu-texts from the category of prayer
as it is defined in this introduction. 187 These texts invoke a god and express con-
cerns to that god (albeit in the form of a question) in order to gain divine assis-
tance (in the form of a yes-no response via an extispicy result). All of the texts
treated in Lambert’s edition are written in SB Akkadian and were found in first
millennium contexts, even if it is likely that some of them go back to OB
times. 188
The tamitu-prayers address Shamash and Adad as a pair, using the same ep-
ithets in their initial lines as do the ikribu-prayers: “lord of judgment” (bēl dīnim)
and “lord of divination” (bēl bīri), respectively. Like the ikribu-prayers, 189 the

The phrase also occurs in the OB prayers related to the diviner treated in this volume. See the
prayer at page 85 (its lines 13, 18, 33, 41, 49, 53, 57, 66) and the one at page 78 (line 24).

See Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5–7 for Lambert’s etymological discussion. He claims that
the two very similar words tāmītu (OB tāwītum) and tamītu were “confused or equated” in ancient
times (6). Starr translates the term similarly, “oracle query” (Queries to the Sungod, 357). CDA,
402, following AHw, 1340 (s.v. tāwītum), renders the former “response” (“Anfragebeantwor-
tung”) and the latter “oath” (“Beschworenes, Eid”) (CDA, 397 and AHw, 1314).
187
On the basis of his remarks in the introduction, it is likely that Lambert would agree (see
Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5). On the other hand, von Soden does not include tamitus in his
overview of Akkadian prayers (see his “Gebete II,” 165).

In fact, some tamitu-prayer colophons preserve the phrase tamīt ikribi, rendered by Lambert
as “petitionary tamītus” (Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5), which shows the close relationship of
the two kinds of texts. For the ikribus and other texts related to tamitus, see ibid., 12–14.50tamitu-prayers petition the gods of extispicy for a judgment. The distinctive
characteristic of the petitions in the tamitus is that they communicate the actual
query the supplicant wishes the gods to answer. The queries are always couched
in question form; in fact, the texts are dominated typically by a (sometimes long)
string of questions that often cover the issue of concern from various perspec-
tives, “so that,” as Lambert writes, “the answer would not mislead due to defects
in the phraseology of the question.” 190 These questions are always asked in a
fashion that can be answered via an affirmative or negative reply. Sometimes the
questions concern things beyond the control of the supplicant (e.g., a lunar
eclipse or whether a pregnant woman will survive delivery), but more often than
not the questions concern a course of action to which the supplicant wants the
gods to give the stamp of approval (e.g., a military action). Because the diviners
were aware of the possibility that even the longest list of questions could leave
potential loopholes that might lead to an unclear reply, the diviners added what
is called ezib-clauses (ezib is an imperative meaning “leave aside, ignore”) that
asked the gods to overlook or dismiss anything that might impede a reliable
answer. The answer, that is, the decision of the gods, is provided via extispicy,
though there is one text in which an exceptional means of divination occurs (see
Lambert’s text no. 15). The answers are not recorded with the tamitus. We do,
however, have tablets on which diviners report the results of their extispicy ritu-
als for delivery to the person concerned, oftentimes the king. 191
The queries as they have come down to us were not asked for a particular
occasion; or rather, if they were, the particulars were not usually preserved
(there are a few exceptions). Several lines of evidence taken together suggest
this conclusion. First, some of the textual witnesses for tamitus preserve more
than one query-prayer per physical tablet, indicating an attempt to create a
compendium or series. Although there is no single standardized series of tami-
tus, Lambert presents evidence for several local serial collections from Nimrud,
Nineveh, and some other Babylonian city (possibly Sippar or Babylon). 192 Sec-
ond, some of the texts occur in multiple copies. If these were one-off texts creat-
ed for a particular situation, one would not expect to find multiple copies. Third,
annanna and annannītu occur as substitutes for proper names within the texts
with only a few exceptions (all of the exceptions are names that go back to the

OB period). 193 These generic placeholder words strongly suggest the texts were
intended to be adapted for a variety of clients. It seems therefore that the tami-
tu-prayers were part of the scribal tradition and were preserved as models, at
least potentially, for similar situations that might arise in the future. Lambert
finds this idea “certain because different surviving questions on related subjects
are in part identically worded.” 194
The tablets preserving the tamitus in Lambert’s edition typically include the
rubric tamīt X at the end of each query, where X represents a thematic distilla-
tion of the text’s query. For example, Lambert’s text no. 1, line 183 reads tamīt
ana šulum maṣṣarti, “a query for the safety of the guards (lit. watch)” (see page
470). His text no. 21, line 9 reads tamīt annannītu itti annanna mutīša kīnāti ītam-
mi, “a query concerning whether female so-and-so is speaking the truth (lit. true
things) to male so-and-so, her husband.” The tamitu-prayers range over a broad
array of topics including such things as lunar eclipses, the result of a river or-
deal, and whether a slave had been faithful to his master, but the success of mili-
tary actions and personal safety are the topics most frequently found.
The following is a description of the structure of a typical tamitu-prayer,
based on Lambert’s work. 195 After the invariable invocation (cited above), tami-
tu-prayers may include an identification of the person for whom the diviner is
performing the extispicy and the stipulated term, that is, the time period for
which the inquiry applies (usually within the month or the year the ritual is
being performed). The question that the supplicant wishes the gods to answer
may be presented at any point after the invocation. The persuasions take the
form of flattery, ilūtkunu rabītu īde, “your great divinity knows,” or what Lambert
interprets (cautiously) as an implied threat, āmiru immaru šēmû išemmû, “the seer
will see (and) the hearer will hear.” The latter is interpreted by Lambert as fol-
lows: “if no answer, or a wrong answer is given, news of this may spread to the
detriment of the gods’ reputation.” 196 The first form of persuasion may occur
anywhere after the invocation; the second form always comes after the diviner’s
question. Technical qualifications, that is, the clauses intended to cover possible
oversights or problems with the formulation of the question, if present, occur
after the question itself. These qualifications are usually expressed with the ezib-
clauses but a “why”-question format, whose meaning is still unclear, is also at-
tested. The tamitu-prayers end in a variety of ways, but the most common is the
rather abrupt (ilūtkunu) Šamaš u Adad kīam, “Your divinity, O Shamash and
Adad, thus.” It is likely that the kīam indicates an abbreviation and should be
taken to mean “etc.,” suggesting that the diviner would fill in the ending for

The OB names are all kings, Hammurabi, Abi-Eshuḫ, and Samsu-ditana, and they are only
mentioned in the Nimrud edition (see Lambert, Babylonian Oracle Questions, 15).

See ibid., 17 for a brief discussion of both stock phrases and contrast it with Starr’s interpre-
tation (Queries to the Sun God, xix–xx). See note 200 below.52themselves with some formulaic phrase(s). Sometimes kīam is followed by a de-
scription of the ritual acts involved in the extispicy. 197
The tamitu-prayers are very similar to the NA queries to Shamash, written
during the Sargonid-era (722–609 BCE ) in SB Akkadian and edited by Ivan Starr
in Queries to the Sun God (SAA 4). Unlike the tamitus in Lambert’s edition, these
prayer-queries are coarsely written one to a tablet without duplicates and seem
therefore to be intended for one and only one occasion. Also unlike the tamitus,
they are only addressed to Shamash; Adad is entirely absent. There are many
structural similarities between the two kinds of queries and they share many
phrases, but on the whole the NA queries are more rigid and formulaic.
These prayers invariably open with the phrase, Šamaš bēlu rabû ša ašallūka
anna kīna apalanni, “O Shamash, great lord, whom I am asking, answer me with
a firm yes.” 198 The stipulated term is designated and then follows the query
proper, formulated as a direct question, as in the tamitu-prayers. Unlike the
question in the tamitu-prayers, however, the query in the NA texts have a highly
formulaic structure and utilize stereotyped phrases throughout, some of which
are keyed to particular topics that arise in the queries somewhat frequently. 199
The first and last of three closing formulae in the query correspond to what
Lambert calls persuasions (see above). The middle closing formula in the query
reads, ina šalimti ina pî ilūtīka rabīti Šamaš bēlu rabû qabi kūn, “with a favorable
reply, according to the command of your great divinity, O Shamash, great lord,
speak (and) confirm (it).” 200
The ezib-clauses follow the query. Unlike the tamitu-prayers, these clauses
are quite extensive in the NA texts and may be divided into three sections. The
first section of ezibs derives from the particular situation of the query and there-
fore contains clauses of quite variable content. The second section contains ezibs
that are attested between three and eight times and seem to be somewhat stereo-
typed (e.g., “disregard that an angry man, or one in distress spoke angrily the
words of his report” 201 ). They are much less common than those found in the
third section, the standard ezibs. These seven clauses are concerned with the
ritual performance itself and the purity of everything involved in the extispicy
(the diviner, the lamb, and the location of the ritual). These ezibs are always
found in the queries, appear in the same order, and, apart from the last two,
show little variation in their construction and wording. 202

The following general outline of the NA query to Shamash is based on Starr’s work in Queries
to the Sun God, xvi–xxviii.

See ibid., xviii.
200
Starr translates all three closing formulae as questions (ibid., xx). The above translation fol-
lows Lambert’s notion that the phrases that conclude the query are intended to persuade the
deity to give a positive reply. Therefore, they are translated as statements.

A standardized formula bridges between the ezibs and the repetition of the
query: lū nasḫā lū bērā, “though they (i.e., these formulations) be excerpted,
though they be selected.” 203 According to Lambert, this formula, which may also
conclude a tamitu-prayer, was one last attempt by the diviner to cover all poten-
tial problems in his prayer that might lead to misleading results. 204 The repeated
query, unlike the first occurrence, is stated as an indirect question, ašâlka Šamaš
bēlu rabû kî, “I ask you, O Shamash, great lord, whether. . . .”
Two closing formulae end the prayer. The first one has a longer and shorter
form: 205 ina libbi immeri annî izizzam-ma anna kīna {uṣurāti šalmāti šērē tamīt
damqāti šalmāti ša pî ilūtīka rabīti} šuknam-ma lūmur, which, following Starr, may
be translated as “be present (lit. stand) in this sheep, place an affirmative answer
(in it), {favorable designs, favorable, propitious omens of the oracular query by
the command of your great divinity} so that I may see (them).” The second clos-
ing formula reads: eli ilūtīka rabīti Šamaš bēlu rabû lillik-ma têrtu lītappal, “[m]ay
(this) query go to your great divinity, O Shamash, great lord, and may an oracle
be given as an answer” (again, following Starr). 206 These two closing formulae
were often written with a gap between them on the tablet, into which the divin-
er recorded the technical results of the extispicy.

As a preface to the discussion, some important distinctions should be noted
within the Akkadian material grouped by modern Assyriologists under the head-
ing “letter-prayers.” 209 Akkadian letter-prayers in the OB period were written by
private individuals and kings. Individuals presented personal petitions to a deity,
probably a personal deity. 210 Kings expressed concerns that may be characterized
as political and/or military in nature to a deity—issues more appropriate to a
king. 211 The literary form of all of these OB letter-prayers is quite comparable to
a mundane or secular letter. And there is no indication that the senders viewed
them as anything beyond just that (though see below). (The identification of
these texts as prayer, therefore, derives not from an ancient scribal classification
but from the modern definition of prayer that scholars have imposed on the
texts.) In distinction to the OB letter-prayers, the Akkadian letter-prayers in the
first millennium all derive from the Assyrian imperial court and were composed
by/for Assyrian kings to report their military actions to the gods. These texts
display a very polished literary style and include various feats of heroism and
military prowess in order to aggrandize the king. 212 Although they begin as do
letters, these texts show more similarities with the Assyrian royal inscriptions
than mundane letters. Without intending to prejudice the discussion or to dis-
qualify or limit the term’s use to only a segment of this material, the ensuing
discussion is based on the OB letter-prayers from individuals.
The OB letter-prayers often contain many of the same features as other clas-
ses of prayer discussed in this introduction: an invocation, perhaps a brief divine
epithet, laments, petitions, and a promise of praise. Three elements, however,
make the letter-prayers distinct from the other prayer classes discussed in this

letter-prayers, is now available in his collected essays volume The World’s Oldest Literature: Stud-
ies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres, 255–367.
210
Van der Toorn (Family Religion, 131) believes all of the private letter-prayers are addressed to
a deity in the capacity of a personal god. There are only about a half dozen or so OB letter-
prayers from individuals (see van der Toorn, Family Religion, 130, n.64). Those known to me
include the prayers listed in note 207 above along with F. R. Kraus, “Ein altbabylonischer
Privatbrief an eine Gottheit,” RA 65 (1971), 27–36.
211
All of the OB royal letter-prayers are from Mari. See ARM 26=AEM I/1, nos. 191 and 193
and ARM 1 3. On the latter, see Jack M. Sasson, “Yasmah-Addu’s Letter to God (ARM I : 3),”

introduction. First, the letter-prayers use the epistolary format to express the
supplicant’s concerns to the deity. The letter-prayers therefore begin as would
any standard letter, ana DN qibī-ma umma PN-ma, “To DN, thus says PN.” Sec-
ond, the letter-prayers were written for a particular situation. Therefore, one will
not find in these prayers the generic annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-
and-so,” formula often found in the other prayers because the OB letter-prayers
were not intended to be used over and over again. Finally, the OB letter-prayers
seem to have been used as ex voto objects. 213 That is, like a statue placed before
a deity on one’s behalf (see footnote 27 above), an OB letter-prayer was deposit-
ed before the deity’s image in the shrine. If the evidence of AbB 6, no. 135 may
be generalized, it seems a letter-prayer was read to the deity (by someone other
than the supplicant) before being deposited. 214 The tablet would then become a
physical reminder before the deity of the supplicant’s concerns and petitions.
Royal Prayers:

to the Mesopotamian Textual Record 2. Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, 2007, 82–87. {A list
of several royal prayers and hymns.}
In many respects “royal prayers” is a non-category since nearly all of the
prayers in this volume were or could have been used by kings of ancient Meso-
potamia. The prayers that modern scholars typically place in this category,
therefore, are miscellaneous and occasional prayers that were composed explicit-
ly for royal purposes but do not fit easily elsewhere in the taxonomy of prayers
used by Assyriologists. Rather than list these in extenso, only the largest, most
coherent group of texts is discussed here: the various prayers found in building
inscriptions. The NB kings almost always ended their building inscriptions with
a prayer (also referred to as a blessing, Segenswunsch). 215 The deity addressed in
the prayer was determined by what was most appropriate for the structure being
commemorated in the inscription. 216 For example, the concluding prayer to an
inscription commemorating Nebuchadnezzar’s restoration of the Ebabbar temple
at Larsa was directed to Shamash, the resident deity of the temple. 217 Examples

ers a translation of what he identifies as “the last datable Akkadian prayer” (866; see also Seux,
525–26 and von Soden, 291). The prayer, directed at Nabu, occurs in a building inscription from
the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus Soter (281–261 BCE ).

although the Assyrian kings occasionally had prayers literally inscribed on the
various parts of their royal structures. The particular god addressed by such a
prayer, as was the case in the NB prayers, was determined by the object being
inscribed. The parade example comes from Dur Shurrukin, where Sargon had a
short prayer inscribed on the thresholds (or stairs) leading to the temples of Sin,
Adad, Ninurta, Ea, Ningal, and Nabu. 219 In each case, the deity of the temple is
invoked and then petitioned to grant something to the king such as life, a long
reign, good weather, etc. Conspicuously and similar to the NB prayers, these
prayers do not end in praise.

cations in annalistic texts 221 ). Independent hymnic compositions that praise a
benevolent supra-human being (e.g., a god, but also a king, temple, or even
city 222 ) comprise a relatively small group in the preserved Akkadian textual cor-
pus. The number of complete or very well-preserved examples is even smaller.
Unfortunately, despite superscripts and subscripts on some hymnic texts as well
as the availability of ancient catalogs that organize various lyrical compositions
under specific labels, modern scholars have not been able to match formal fea-
tures of the hymns with indigenous scribal classificatory labels. 223 Introductory
treatments of hymns, therefore, tend to be compilations of attested texts, orga-
nized by time period, content (e.g., by entity praised or by the human doing the
praise), and/or various formal characteristics in the hymns that have caught the

A complete taxonomy of the extant hymns with an exhaustive listing is not
possible here. 225 Rather, the present section provides a selection of notable, rep-
resentative, and relatively well-preserved examples of hymns 226 that are availa-
ble in modern editions and translations. Readers desiring to study more hymns
beyond the couple in this volume might turn to these examples next.

For dedicatory texts, see, e.g., two dedications to Adad and Ninurta in A. Kirk Grayson, Assyr-
ian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC : II (858–745 BC ) (RIMA 3; Toronto: University of Toron-
to Press, 1996), 59 and 182, respectively. Many others could be cited. See also the hymnic invo-
cations used in, e.g., several versions of the annals of Shalmaneser (Grayson, Assyrian Rulers of
the Early First Millennium, 13, 26, 33, 51, etc.).
222
For a listing of hymns to the latter three groups, see Foster, Akkadian Literature of the Late
Period, 44–47. For the problems and artificiality of differentiating between these, see briefly
Edzard, “Sumerische und akkadische Hymnen,” 22.
223
The fragmentary state of many hymns has not helped matters. For a discussion of hymns,
scribal superscripts/subscripts, and catalogs, see Brigitte Groneberg, “Searching for Akkadian
Lyrics: From Old Babylonian to the ‘Liederkatalog’ KAR 158,” JCS 55 (2003), 55–74. Classifica-
tory scribal labels, as Groneberg shows, do not seem to correspond to textual form. Rather, they
may have reflected the text’s musical accompaniment, mode of performance, language, ritual
function, and/or content.
224
See, e.g., von Soden, “Hymne. B. Nach akkadischen Quellen,” 545–48 and Foster, Akkadian
Literature of the Late Period, 78–91.
225
For OB hymns, however, the catalog of literary texts in Nathan Wasserman, Style and Form in
Old-Babylonian Literary Texts (Cuneiform Monographs 27; Leiden/Boston: Styx/Brill, 2003), 187–
224 presents a convenient list of all of the (then) known hymns (many of which are fragmen-
tary). Add the hymn to Ningishzida in A. R. George, Babylonian Literary Texts in the Schøyen
Collection (Cornell University Studies in Assyriology and Sumerology 10; Bethesda: CDL Press,
2009), no. 7 and see also M. Krebernik, “Altbabylonische Hymnen an die Muttergöttin (HS
1884),” AfO 50 (2003–2004), 11–20. The anthologies of Akkadian hymns and prayers (see espe-
cially Foster, Seux, and von Soden) give a large and representative sample of hymns, but they do
not reflect an exhaustive catalog. Also, Foster, Akkadian Literature of the Late Period, 78–91 pro-
vides an annotated listing of many first millennium examples.
226
Though, the OB examples are not so well-preserved.58Among OB Texts:
A hymn to Nanaya (VAS 10 215) is composed in fourteen quatrains, as is
the hymn to Ishtar in this volume (see page 111). The Nanaya hymn is relatively
well-preserved, though still incomplete. 227
A hymn to Ishtar from the Louvre (AO 6035) was edited by Brigitte Grone-
berg for the first time relatively recently. Although the tablet is not complete
and an English translation is not available (to my knowledge), Groneberg’s edi-
tion is accompanied by an extensive commentary. 228
Another OB hymn that has regularly found its way into anthologies praises
the obscure god Papulegarra. 229 The tablet probably contains several hymns, but
breaks make precise demarcations between the hymns impossible. 230
Among SB Texts:
Although there are several examples that could be listed, two lengthy and
well-preserved hymns ought to be mentioned first: the Great Shamash Hymn and
the Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi.
The Great Shamash Hymn, edited by W. G. Lambert in his book Babylonian
Wisdom Literature, 231 is a two-hundred-line hymn that celebrates a wide array of
the sun-god’s attributes. 232 The hymn begins with Shamash’s role as the universal
illuminator of darkness, whose light reaches the innermost parts of everything,
and then continues on to mention various justice-related attributes of the deity:
investigation of cases, protection of travelers and other innocents, enforcement

mentary (with plates I–XXVI). The Agushaya Poem, also called Ishtar and Ṣaltu (ṣaltu means
“strife” in Akk.), recounts a chapter in Ishtar’s mythology, but it contains a significant hymnic
element. See Groneberg, Lob der Ištar, 55–93 for an edition, translation, and commentary. See

The content of the hymn (“practical advice on living”) led Lambert to include it among his
collection of “wisdom” texts (Babylonian Wisdom Literature, 5). See page 6 above for the potential
hortatory purpose of prayers and hymns among human listeners.I NTRODUCTION

of oaths, impartial judgment of cases, ensuring of fair business transactions,
helping those in need, granting wisdom to those who ask, etc.
The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi, also edited by Lambert, 233 is another two-
hundred-line hymn, which divides into twenty stanzas of varied length. After an
introductory line that mentions the goddess in the third person, Gula speaks in
the first person until line 188, at which point Bulluṭsa-rabi, the putative author
of the text, begins his concluding petition (in the third person). In the nineteen
stanzas before Bulluṭsa-rabi’s petition Gula alternates her speech between a stan-
za of self-praise (the topic of which varies from stanza to stanza) followed by a
stanza of praise for her spouse, Ninurta (the topic of which is always martial).
Each of these nineteen stanzas ends with the giving of a different name to the
goddess or god. 234
These two texts fall into a category called “Great Hymns and Prayers” by
Foster. 235 In this group, he lists seven hymns/prayers, distinguished mostly by
their extraordinary length (well over one hundred lines). Other examples of the
great hymns and prayers include the Great Prayer to Marduk, 236 the Great Hymn
to Marduk, 237 the Great Hymn to Nabu, 238 Ishtar Queen of Heaven, 239 and the
Great Prayer to Ishtar (for which, see page 257). 240 Given the sophistication of

Why Foster excludes from his list here the long prayer to Ishtar, edited by Lambert in “Three
Literary Prayers of the Babylonians,” 50–55 (with plates VIII–XI), is unclear since he includes it
in Before the Muses, 606–10 (see also Seux, 194–99).60these texts in terms of language, style, and content, they are probably the work
of ancient scholars.
Ashurbanipal’s hymn to Ashur (ABRT I 32–34) provides a good, if still in-
complete example of a hymn in SB Akkadian from the Neo-Assyrian court. 241 In
this hymn, written for the sake of Ashurbanipal (see rev. 8ʹ), Ashur’s name is
written as if it were Anshar ( AN . ŠÁR ), the father of Anu and the great-grandfather
of Marduk according to the Enūma eliš, thus equating Ashur with a god older
than Marduk and exalting Ashur to the head of the pantheon (see rev. 6ʹ).
The so-called syncretistic hymns laud a deity while equating various other
gods with aspects of the deity being praised. Several (incomplete) examples are
known, including a hymn containing a petition to Marduk (KAR 25 ii 3–24), 242
and hymns to Nabu (LKA 16), 243 Ninurta (KAR 102+328), 244 and Ishtar (BM
65454+). 245
Finally, some of the hymns preserved in Akkadian display acrostics, in
which the first syllable of each line combines to spell out a name, petition, or
statement of praise. A notable example is found in Ashurbanipal’s hymn to Mar-
duk (ABRT I 29–31+). 246 The syllables at the beginning of each line combine to
spell out anāku Aššur-bāni-apli ša ilsûka bulliṭannī-ma Maruduk (ma-ru-du-uk) da-
lilīka ludlul, “I (am) Ashurbanipal, who has called out to you, O Marduk. Pre-
serve me that I may sing your praises!” 247

T HE U SE OF A KKADIAN P RAYERS IN THE S TUDY OF THE H EBREW B IBLE :
Anna Elise Zernecke
Scholars of the Hebrew Bible have compared Akkadian prayers and hymns
to the biblical text since the late nineteenth century, when publications and
translations of the Akkadian texts first appeared. Unfortunately, the interest in
these texts was much greater at the beginning of the twentieth century than it is
today. The following pages outline the use of Akkadian prayers in the history of
biblical scholarship, assess the strengths and weaknesses of the various ap-
proaches employed, and conclude by offering some prospects for future compar-
ative work. 248
The first editions and translations of prayers of the lifting of the hand were
published in 1896 by King. The title of King’s book, Babylonian Magic and Sor-
cery. Being ‘The Prayers of the Lifting of the Hand’, already indicates that he was
not sure whether the texts were to be classified as religious or magical. 249 This
insecurity is also clear in the introduction where he characterizes these texts as
“a complete group of tablets inscribed with prayers and religious compositions
of a devotional and somewhat magical character.” 250 The qualification of their
character as magical or religious has also influenced the interest of biblical
scholars in these texts, so that decisions in favor of one of these categories or the
other often gave direction to the Akkadian texts’ reception and interpretation.
The transmission of the texts as part of a ritual was deemed very important in
this regard, though the ritual instructions were often not included in Assyriolog-
ical editions.
Shortly after the first editions appeared, anthologies of translated texts aim-
ing at a wider public made the Akkadian prayers more easily accessible. 251 Bibli-
cal scholars at this time began using the Akkadian prayers as parallels to biblical
prayers, especially the Psalms. The “religionsgeschichtliche Schule” had just
started to establish itself. Therefore, it is not surprising that the first monograph
that compares biblical Psalms with Akkadian prayers, the Habilitation of Stum-
mer, written in Würzburg in 1917, used its form-critical methodology. 252 Along
with his innovative method, Stummer also pursued another question that has
often been asked since the Akkadian prayers were discovered: Is there a genetic

24962relationship between the Akkadian and Hebrew prayers? Stummer answers this
by stating that the authors of the Psalms in fact knew Mesopotamian prayers.
Due to the Akkadian material’s state of publication at the time of his writing,
Stummer mixes texts of many genres and does not differentiate between Sumeri-
an and Akkadian material. But the more basic problem in his work is that the
comparison is done with a theological aim: he wants to establish the high reli-
gious level of Israel’s sacred poetry. 253 Following Gunkel’s form-critical method-
ology at that time, Stummer had taken Gunkel’s statement that there was no
more pressing task for Old Testament scholarship than the systematic compari-
son of the Babylonian and Hebrew religious poetry as an impetus for his work. 254
In response to Stummer’s work, however, Gunkel and Begrich wrote in their
Introduction to the Psalms (1933) 255 that the time had not yet come for a system-
atic comparison of both literatures, as neither of them had been independently
and thoroughly studied. 256
Nevertheless, it was Begrich, who analyzed one aspect of Biblical and Meso-
potamian prayers in a comparative perspective in an article entitled “Die Ver-
trauensäußerungen im israelitischen Klageliede des Einzelnen und in seinem
babylonischen Gegenstück” (1928). 257 Begrich’s approach is much more cautious
than Stummer’s. He first establishes the comparability of biblical and Mesopo-
tamian prayers, discussing the superscriptions and subscriptions, the person of
the supplicant, and their situation. After this, he analyzes the main differences
between the psalms of individual lament and prayers of the lifting of the hand.
Instead of a personal confession of trust as in the biblical texts, the Babylonian
prayers show descriptions of the magnificence of the deity. For Begrich, the un-
derlying relationship between god and man is different in both cultures: where
there is trusting confidence in the biblical material because of a personal rela-
tion, in Mesopotamia, the distance between the supplicant and the deity is such
that the striving for a relationship based on trust is squelched by the conscious-
ness of the grandeur of the deity. 258 Many more Mesopotamian texts are pub-
lished today and the editions are much more detailed, making Begrich’s results

out-of-date. Still, his cautious and precise methodology retains its value for con-
temporary scholarship.
Shortly after its publication, Begrich’s conclusions were contested in one of
the first Assyriological monographs dealing with the literary form of Mesopota-
mian prayers, Kunstmann’s dissertation Die babylonische Gebetsbeschwörung
(1932). 259 It was presumably this publication that coined the term “Gebets-
beschwörung” (incantation-prayer), following Kunstmann’s teacher Lands-
berger. Kunstmann’s methodology is form-critical. He distinguishes “allgemeine”
(general) and “spezielle” (special) “Gebetsbeschwörungen” (incantation-
prayers). In the special variety, the magical act is dominant. In the general in-
cantation-prayers, on the other hand, the prayer is the main and sometimes only
thing. 260 This distinction has not stood the test of time (see above, page 28).
In the years following, several biblical scholars used prayers from Mesopo-
tamia as parallels for biblical texts. Widengren’s monograph The Accadian and
Hebrew Psalms of Lamentation as Religious Documents (1937) is an early exam-
ple. 261 Widengren is not interested in the literary development of the prayers,
but in the comparison of religions. He presupposes an opposition of cult religion
and religious literature and sees a direct dependence of the biblical prayers on
Akkadian religious literature. Widengren’s book consists of long lists of phrases
from both types of texts and their interpretation. Though focusing on “cult reli-
gion,” the precise cultic setting of the texts is oddly not taken into account.
Widengren’s monograph is now of little more than historical interest; his main
thesis has not been followed.
Another comparative approach, again more form-critical in orientation, is
taken by Castellino in his Le Lamentazioni individuali e gli inni in Babilonia e in
Israele. Raffrontati riguardo alla forma e al contenuto (1940). 262 Castellino’s study
compares individual laments and hymns from Mesopotamia and Israel. He first
establishes the general compatibility of the texts by describing each corpus sepa-
rately and then compares the results. Despite this cautious methodology, the
results of the study are hampered by Castellino’s notion of magic, which is never
made explicit. He states that all Babylonian individual prayers are essentially
magical incantations aiming at coercing the gods. Therefore, his study ends up
being a comparison of the “Hebrew” and the “Babylonian-Assyrian religions,” in
which Israel certainly comes out as superior.
Just after Ebeling’s new edition of the Akkadian prayers appeared (Die ak-
kadische Gebetsserie “Handerhebung.” Von neuem gesammelt und herausgegeben,

do alla forma e al contenuto (Torino: Società editrice internazionale, 1940).641953), 263 a new form-critical assessment of the relation between Mesopotamian
and Biblical prayers took shape in Westermann’s study Das Loben Gottes in den
Psalmen (first published in 1954). 264 Following Stummer and Kunstmann, his
main focus is on the hymnic introduction. Noting that Mesopotamian prayers of
lament have a hymnic introduction that has no equivalent in psalms of lament,
Westermann argued that this indicates that there are two different genres in the
Bible (the individual lament and what Westermann calls the hymn of descriptive
praise) whereas there is only one in Mesopotamia. The hymnic passages are seen
as praise of the deity within the pantheon in Mesopotamia, whereas in Israel
Yahweh has a history with his people which is praised. In other words, Mesopo-
tamians praised the gods in their cosmic function and their general actions and
the Israelites praised their god for what he had done for them in history. One
problem with this approach is that Westermann only looks at the abstract struc-
tures without taking into account their concretion in the individual texts. Also,
he does not see that in the hymnic passages of Akkadian prayers, the character-
istics of the deity, which are vital for the problems of the supplicant, are often
praised, therefore establishing a relationship between god and supplicant.
The general problem of many form-critical approaches is that the peculiari-
ties of the individual texts are overlooked in overall comparisons of genres. Dal-
glish’s monograph avoids this at least on one side: one single text, Psalm 51, 265 is
analyzed with parallels in structure and content from all over the ancient Near
East. The aim is to establish the relationship between biblical and ancient Near
Eastern prayer literature. The particularistic analysis of only one side of the
comparison, however, makes the study somewhat lopsided. Dalglish explains the
similarities in the ancient Near Eastern and biblical texts partly as a common
Proto-Semitic heritage and partly as influence of these other texts on Hebrew
literature. 266 But still, in his opinion, the differences outweigh the similarities.
After these studies, the form-critical approach lost its appeal to many bibli-
cal scholars. A symptom of this can be seen in Muilenburg’s presidential address
at the annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in 1968. 267 Yet among

cists had lost interest. Mayer closely follows Kunstmann’s study and meticulous-
ly collects the phrases and their combinations in every part of the prayers he

not trigger a new initiative for comparing Akkadian and Hebrew prayers, even
though many of the former drawbacks in such work would now have been much
easier to overcome. Still, the Akkadian prayers continued to be read and studied
by some biblical scholars.
Gerstenberger’s monograph, Der bittende Mensch: Bittritual und Klagelied des
Einzelnen im Alten Testament (1980), 269 investigates the Sitz im Leben of the indi-
vidual laments in the book of Psalms. He reconstructs this partly by using shuil-
la-prayers and namburbi-rituals as analogies and postulates on the basis of this
analogy the existence of ritual specialists in Israel. These reconstructions are
quite plausible, though rather optimistic, as there is very little biblical evidence
with which to work.
A new approach is taken by Albertz in his Persönliche Frömmigkeit und offizi-
elle Religion: Religionsinterner Pluralismus in Israel und Babylon (1978). 270 In this
work Albertz first established the plurality within the religion of ancient Israel.
He distinguishes between different social strata of religion and tries to recon-
struct elements of private piety, which must be differentiated from the official
religion. Within this socially-differentiated framework, he classifies the biblical
psalms of individual lament as deriving from the domain of pre-exilic private
piety, whereas the Mesopotamian incantation-prayers originated in another so-
cial stratum of religion because of their complicated ritual contexts and their
developed hymnic introductions. Albertz also discusses the concept of a “person-
al god” for both Mesopotamia and Israel, which was first analyzed by Vorlän-
der. 271
In the last third of the twentieth century, Akkadian prayers were used in
Hebrew Bible scholarship in a variety of approaches. For example, the enemies
in the Biblical laments were explained as sorcerers in analogy to Mesopotamian
ritual texts. 272 The several biblical laments of the individual that lament Yah-

psalms’ conclusions were seen to have Mesopotamian analogies. 274 Akkadian
prayers were also used and cited when studying different literary and conceptual
motifs. 275 But the texts stood only rarely at the center of attention, as in the dis-

Despite the occasional attention, only in the last ten years has a renewed in-
terest in Akkadian prayers and their relevance for the study of the Hebrew Bible
taken place. Following the methodological initiative of an article by Abusch, 277
Zgoll not only edited all extant shuilla-prayers addressed to Ishtar and fragments
thereof, but also interpreted them as pieces of literature (2003). 278 She also ana-
lyzed the function of the ritual setting of these prayers in several articles. 279 The
ritual dimensions and the problems of genre are also the main topic of Fre-
chette’s dissertation, “The Name of the Ritual: Investigating Ancient Mesopota-
mian ‘Hand-lifting’ Rituals with Implications for the Study of Genre in the
Psalms” (2005). 280 He inquires into the meaning of the characteristic subscrip-
tion of shuilla-prayers and discloses the problems of previous form-critical stud-
ies, which treated the ancient subscription as modern designations of genres
without inquiring into their original significance. He demonstrates the flexibility
of shuilla-prayers, which were recited in different ritual contexts. Finally, his

interpretation of the “lifted-hand” as a central and reciprocal gesture converges
with Zgoll’s analysis of the ritual as audience.
A very different approach is taken by Achenbach in two related articles
(2004), which look into the Sitz im Leben of both Mesopotamian and Biblical
prayers of different genres and investigate their transmission, collection, and
new contextualization within different rituals. 281
Lenzi (2010) 282 and Zernecke (2009) 283 take up anew the form-critical ques-
tion of Begrich’s “classical” paper. Via a different approach, both simultaneously
arrived at the conclusion that Begrich is right in his analysis that the relation
between deity and supplicant is different in Akkadian shuilla-prayers and bibli-
cal prayers of individual lament. But this does not indicate that the trust in
Yahweh was generally greater in Israel than the trust in the deities in Mesopo-
tamia. Shuilla-prayers are not the appropriate analogy to biblical laments of the
individual in terms of the relation between god and man. The Mesopotamian
dingirshadibba-prayers are structured like the biblical psalms of lament without
hymnic introduction, but they also comprise addresses demonstrating a close
and trustful relationship. Therefore, both authors conclude that the psalms of
individual lament are addressed to Yahweh as the personal god of the suppli-
cant, just as dingirshadibba-prayers are addressed to the personal god. On the
other hand, shuilla-prayers speak to a high deity of the pantheon and mention
the personal god and goddess only in passing. Zernecke arrives at this conclusion
via a detailed study of particular texts, as the definition of genre is different in
Assyriology and in Hebrew Bible studies. By comparing individual texts, the
conclusions are necessarily limited in scope, but this enables her to analyze the
different versions of single texts and their possible development over time.
During the last one hundred years, Akkadian prayers have proven an inter-
esting and important parallel to the prayers transmitted within the canon of the
Bible. The importance of the Mesopotamian texts cannot be overemphasized.
Since there are very few comparable texts from the Levant in Ugaritic or Arama-
ic with which to compare the biblical prayers, the Akkadian prayers are the
closest analogy to the biblical prayers and deserve much more attention than
they have received up to now. Most Akkadian prayers are known from tablets of
the first millennium BCE , spanning nearly the whole millennium; therefore, they
can be considered more or less contemporary to biblical literature.

psalmen Ps 38 und Ps 22 im Vergleich (AOAT 387; Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, forthcoming).68As scholars who study the form of these texts are now paying more atten-
tion to their ritual setting and function as well as to the difference between the
ancient subscriptions and modern form-critical designations, the discussion of
form-critical parallels should start afresh. Also, the question of ritual settings
and the different contextualizations of Akkadian prayers could be more inten-
sively discussed by biblical scholars. Most theories in the realm of literary criti-
cism, that is, reconstructing earlier stages of Biblical texts, are hypothetical. In
this point, the Akkadian material could serve as an important parallel, as the
texts are often transmitted on more than one tablet and with substantial differ-
ences. The poetic form of both Akkadian and biblical prayers is often similar,
but comparative studies in this field are rare so far. The wealth of motives and
concepts, of formulas and stock-phrases in both literatures also awaits a system-
atic analysis.
All of these prospective approaches are dependent on the future develop-
ment of Assyriology. But the analysis of these texts holds out the promise of so-
lutions for several old problems in biblical studies and the development of a
better understanding of what prayer and ritual meant in the ancient Near East,
in Mesopotamia and Israel, and how these cultures conceived the relation be-
tween deity and humanity.O LD B ABYLONIAN

An OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night
J EFFREY L. C OOLEY
T HE G ODS OF THE N IGHT :
The gods invoked in this prayer are not particularly distinguished in the OB
period. Indeed, other than Girra and Erra, those listed are not well-attested as
the focus of veneration, nor are they featured as principles in contemporary lit-
erature. 1 Nevertheless, the Gods of the Night (ilū mušītim) do appear in several
prayers in the magical ritual Maqlû, where they are petitioned for protection
against disease, black magic, and ritual impurity. 2 A more elaborate prayer to
night gods also for the purpose of preparing for an extispicy is known from the
NA period as well (see Oppenheim), though there does not seem to be any ge-
netic relationship between it and the OB prayer treated here. Although there is
modest overlap, the gods listed in our prayer, Maqlû, and the NA prayer are not
the same. Thus, the epithet “Gods of the Night” is by no means a formal title
associated with a fixed set of divinities. Rather, it is simply a descriptive rubric
to refer to any divine grouping that is visible at night in astral form and which a
particular text wishes to address en masse.
The primary manifestations of most of the Gods of the Night appear to be
specific stars and constellations, some of which we are able to identify with rea-
sonable certainty (see the notes below). On the other hand, Girra and Erra are
gods associated with fire and plague respectively and are mostly featured out-
side of a celestial context in cult and literature. Girra is the god of fire and the
hero in a fragmentary OB myth. In that myth, Girra slays a monster named
Elamatum, which is then transformed into a constellation. 3 He is often equated
with the god Gibil (one of Marduk’s fifty names in Enūma eliš VII 115), though
the two deities were originally separate. Girra/Gibil plays a significant role in
the magical defense against witchcraft, being one of the prime deities appealed
1
A possible exception to this is mušḫuššu, which might be featured in the fragmentary Labbu
Myth (see the comments to line 18).

7172to in the series Maqlû. Erra (who is often associated with Nergal) is the dark
protagonist of the first-millennium epic Erra and Ishum, 4 in which, not coinci-
dentally, celestial divination plays a major role. 5 Girra and Erra are associated
with celestial features in addition to their primary mundane hypostases. While
we do not know with what astral feature Girra is associated, Erra is later identi-
fied as a particular star, the Fox ( MUL . KA 5 . A , Akk. šēlebum) in the Wagon constel-
lation ( MUL . MAR . GÍD . DA , Akk. ereqqum, see line 19 below), 6 or even the planet
Mars (via his identification with the Fox star, which is also equated with Mars). 7
T HE P RAYER :
The prayer makes petition to these celestial deities for their participation in
an extispicy ritual, during which a lamb was sacrificed and its exta were exam-
ined. It would have been recited by a diviner (bārû) in the evening that the sacri-
fice took place. Such mantic acts were conceived in terms of a trial, with the
inquirer as the defendant and the gods as the judges. Thus, the terminology used
in the prayer is, to a certain degree, legal in nature (e.g., lines 6 and 8: Šamaš
Sîn Adad Ištar . . . ul idinnū dīnam ul iparrasū awātim “Shamash, Sin, Adad and
Ishtar . . . do not render judgment, they do not decide a case,” and line 24, kit-
tam šuknān, “place truth!”).
Though the patron gods of extispicy were Shamash and Adad (see pages 197
and 85), many of the major gods who dwelled in the sky were responsible for
the legal decision to be made. 8 According to the prayer (lines 6–7), however,
they are no longer present for the diviner to appeal to. The celestial deities here
invoked are stars and constellations which, like the sun during the day, have a
universal purview of the cosmos at night. They are not, however, the primary
judges of the extispicy, but rather function in a mediating role between the peti-
tioning bārû, together with his client, and the high gods. Specifically, Steinkeller

Adad, as a weather god, is located in the sky. Ishtar and Sin are, obviously, Venus and the
moon, respectively. The prayer seems to have been used, thus, on an evening when neither that
planet nor the moon was visible.𒁹 A N OB P RAYER TO THE G ODS OF THE N IGHT

argues, the stars act as personal advocates of the inquirer. While the high gods,
primarily Shamash and Adad, are ultimately responsible for the verdict ren-
dered, the night gods nonetheless play a vital role for the inquirer who, by the
very choice to engage in such a mantic act, has entered the courtroom of the
most powerful judges in the cosmos. The inquirer desires a truthful and propi-
tious outcome and for this they need all the help they can muster.
The prayer is logically divided into two sections. The first, lines 1–13, de-
scribe the situation: the city is buttoned up and the high gods are unavailable.
Lines 14–24 form the second: the actual invocation of the Gods of the Night in
which they are asked to stand at the ready so that they might assist in the ex-
tispicy. Line 25 is the rubric.
The text of the prayer is quite well-preserved in two OB copies of unknown
provenance. Variations between these are relatively minor. This treatment fea-
tures the text discovered in 1924 but most recently published by Wayne Horo-
witz in 2000 (= MS A). The second copy (= MS B) was discovered and published
by G. Dossin in 1935, shortly after MS A came to light.

Line 1: Pullulum (D of palālum), “to guard closely.” This form, like several of the verbs
that follow, is a predicative. Predicative verbal constructions predominate in lines 1–4, and
this underscores the inert state of the land as described in the text. This first word of the
prayer has been the subject of significant debate, but it is now generally agreed that this is
the reading, though the form is admittedly unusual, in that the D stem of this root is oth-
erwise unattested (see A. Livingstone, NABU 1990, #86). Rubûm, “prince.”
pullulū rubû
Line 2: Wašārum, “to sink, to let down.” Sikkūrum, “a locking bolt.” Šīrtum (šērtum), “a
locking ring.” For this definition, see A. Livingstone, NABU 1990, #87. Šakānum, “to set,
to place.” Note also that šīrtum is a homophone of šīrtum, “morning.” Perhaps this is a
deliberate word play on the author’s part? For this line, MS B has šikkātum šērētum tabkā,
“the pegs, the locking rings are lying flat.”
wašrū sikkūrū šīrētum šaknā

plural, nišū. Šaqummum, “silent,” an adj., is used here predicatively (3fp).

Bābum, “gate, door.”

state) rather than ilī. For the genitive when we expect the nominative, see also mušītim in
line 9 and ilī mušītim in line 14. Mātum, “land.” Ištartum, “goddess.” The proper name of
the goddess, par excellence, is frequently used as a common noun to indicate female gods.

Line 7: Erēbum, “to enter.” This common verb takes on a technical meaning when
referring to a celestial body, such as the sun (i.e., Shamash), the moon, a planet, or star,
namely, “to set.” Utlum, “lap” (utul is the construct/bound form). Šamû, “sky, heaven.” The
word almost always occurs in the plural. Utul šamê refers to the sky’s interior that is not
visible to humanity but in which the gods reside. See Wayne Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cos-
mic Geography (Mesopotamia Civilizations 8; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1998), 250–52 for
discussion.
īterbū ana utul šamê
Line 8: Ul, a particle of negation. Diānum (dânu), “to judge.” Dīnum, “judgment, deci-
sion.” The idiom dīnam diānum indicates a variety of things, including “to (legally) sen-
tence, to render a judgment.” Within the context of this prayer and within divination in
general, this is the act of providing guidance through an oracle. As noted above, the gods’
guidance in mantic practice was considered the rendering of a binding legal decision.
Parāsum, “to cut.” Awātum, “word, matter.” The idiom awātam parāsum is essentially syn-
onymous with dīnam diānum.
ul idinnū dīnam ul iparrasū awātim
Line 9: Pussumum (D of pasāmum, with the same meaning as the G in the predicative),
“to cover, to veil.” Mušītum, “night.” Mušītim is clearly the subject of the D fs predicative
pussumat; however, it is in the genitive case and this might be a scribal error. MS B has mu-
ši-tum here. For the genitive when we expect the nominative, see also lines 5 and 14.
pussumat mušītim
Line 10: É . GAL = ēkallum, “palace.” Šaḫūrum, a kind of ritual building associated with
a larger complex of buildings, is often translated simply as “chapel.” See CAD Š/1, 108–9.
Kummum, “shrine, innermost sanctum, cella.” The term can refer both to a part of a struc-
ture and to a structure in its own right. See CAD K, 533–34. It is undoubtedly in the singu-
lar (no vowel length is indicated in the orthography, though the scribe does not consistent-
ly indicate this), but it lacks the expected mimation. Adārum “to be dark, obscured” (G
3mp predicative). The term is particularly common in celestial divination literature in
which it can refer to the eclipse of the sun or moon, or the obscuration of a star or planet.
See CAD A/1, 103–4 and note, in particular, the usage of adārum in the OB celestial omen
text from the Hermitage (republished in the edition by Horowitz, 204, line 12). The idea
might be that these religious structures, which are the seats of certain deities during the
day are, in a sense, “eclipsed” during the night, when the night gods take over and their
seats, i.e., the stars, etc., are visible.

The scribe’s orthography here (i-ša-ši) is defective for the durative form. Instead of išassi,
MS B has uselle (from sullûm), “he appeals to, prays to.” Ša dīnim, though often understood

(Št of bitrûm [Gt]) “to do permanently, to continue.” The origin of this common but unu-
sual root is difficult; AHw derives it from berûm, “to starve.” See AHw, 123 and CAD B,
279–81. Šittum, “sleep.” Here the accusative case is adverbial.
ālik urḫim ilam išassi u ša dīnim ušteberre šittam
Line 12: Dayyānum, “judge” (dayyān = construct/bound form). Kittum (from kin-
tum*), “truth.” Abum, “father.” Ekūtum, “a destitute girl.” MS B repeats kittum at the end of
the line, replacing ekūtum. The masculine equivalent of the term ekūtum does not occur. As
such it often occurs in parallel with almattum, “widow.” See CAD E, 72–73. Here the epi-
thets dayyān kinātim and abi ekiātim are epithets of the sun god Shamash, mentioned by
name in the next line.
dayyān kinātim abi ekiātim
Line 13: Erēbum, see line 7. Shamash’s kummum here does not seem to be an area of
an earthly shrine, but rather his own private cella in the celestial residence of the gods.
Šamaš īterub ana kummīšu
Line 14: Line 14 begins a long sentence, whose main verb appears in line 21. Rabûm,
“great.” The mp adjective here seems to be acting in apposition to ilī mušītim rather than
serving as an attributive adjective. For ilī as a nominative, see comments to line 5 and 9.

Line 15: Nawrum, “shining, brilliant,” is a common adj. applied to celestial bodies.
= Girra. As mentioned in the introduction, the fire god Girra is the protagonist in
the poorly preserved OB myth called Girra and Elamatum, in which he slays a monster
called Elamatum and makes her into a constellation. In this context, it is important to note
that the constellation Elamatum appears in MS B after qaštum ( MS A line 17) and in the
place of nīrum. Ms B thus features both the protagonist and adversary of the OB myth.

qurādum Erra
Line 17: Qaštum, “bow.” Here qaštum refers to the Bow constellation, probably part of
Canis Major (Reiner and Pingree, 11; Gössmann, #47). This constellation features promi-
nently in Enūma eliš as Marduk’s prized weapon, which is installed in the sky and adopted
by Anu as his own daughter (VI 82–91). That passage is a rare example of catasterism in
Mesopotamian literature. (See also Astrolabe B B1:14–16 [KAV 218] and MUL . APIN I ii 7.)
Nīrum, “yoke.” Otherwise written logographically as ŠUDUN . Nīrum is possibly to be identi-
fied as the constellation Boötes (Reiner and Pingree, 15; Gössmann, #379).
qaštum nīrum
Line 18: MS B begins the line with zappum, literally, “a bristle of hair,” but here a
name for the Pleiades (normally written MUL . MUL ; Reiner and Pingree, 13; Gössmann,
#171 and #279) Šitadarrum, “Orion.” Note also the by-forms šitadallum and šidallum, as
well as the common Sumerian orthography SIPA . ZI . AN . NA (“the true shepherd of heaven”).
The origin and meaning of the Akkadian name is unclear, though Gössmann suggests it is
derived from the verb šadālum, “to be wide,” and means something like “the wide man,
the giant” (Reiner and Pingree, 14; Gössmann, #348). Mušḫuššum, “furious serpent.” This
constellation is only attested in the OB period. It might be the dragon whose origin is de-
scribed in the Labbu Myth (Frans Wiggermann, “Tišpak, his Seal, and the Dragon
Mušhuššu,” in To the Euphrates and Beyond: Archaeological Studies in Honor of Mauits N. van
Loon [ed. O. Haex et al; Rotterdam: A. A. Balkema, 1989], 117–33, esp. 126). Gössmann
equates it with the later constellation MUŠ , though this is by no means certain; if it is the
case, however, it is possibly to be identified with the constellation Hydra (Reiner and
Pingree, 13; Gössmann, #284).

(Reiner and Pingree, 16; Gössmann #145).

12.7.1985 [ed. K. Hecker and W. Sommerfeld; Berlin: Dietrich Reimer, 1986], 55–59). In
these mythological contexts, however, there is no need to identify kusarrikkum with this
astral manifestation. Bašmum, “horned serpent.” This unidentified constellation is only
attested in the OB period. Though Gössmann (#51) suggested that this be identified as the
constellation Hydra, his proposal is merely a stab in the dark. A bašmum is also featured as
one of the monsters created by Tiamat in Enūma eliš (I 141). In addition to their literary
attestations, these two monsters appear together in Šurpu VIII 6–7 (see Erica Reiner, Šurpu:
A Collection of Sumerian and Akkadian Incantations [AfO Beiheft 11; Graz, 1958], 39). MS B
omits bašmum but adds ilū mušītim rabītim, “gods of the great night.”
kusarikkum bašmum
Line 21: Izuzzum/uzuzzum, “to stand, to make an appearance.” The form is a G 3mp
precative. This root in the precative is quite common in prayers which request a god’s
presence. The scribe mistakenly omitted a ZU sign. MS B has the cp impv. izizzānim here,
thus keeping the person by which the supplicant addresses the deities consistent. See
comment on line 24 below. The enclitic –ma is attached to a volitive/injunctive form and
is followed by another volitive/injunctive form, i.e., šuknān in line 23. Thus, a simple
“and” will not suffice in a translation. It needs to be rendered as indicating a purpose
clause (“so that, in order that”).
lizzizū-ma
Line 22: Têrtum, “extispicy.” The term refers broadly to a report or instruction. But
within this context it is a technical term referring to this particular act of divination.
Epēšum, “to do, to make.” The verb has the subordinating/subjunctive marker –u. The
relative clause is, in this case, not marked by ša. In such unmarked clauses the antecedent
is in the bound/construct state, as is têrti here (see also line 23). Têrtam epēšum is an idiom
meaning, “to perform an extispicy.”
ina têrti eppušu
Line 23: Puḫādum, “lamb.” The word is in the bound/construct state, since it precedes
an unmarked relative clause. MS B has ikribi, “offering.” Karābum, “to offer.” Note again the
subordinating/subjunctive marker –u.
ina puḫād akarrabu
Line 24: Kittum, “truth, justice.” Šakānum, “to place” (cp impv. plus what seems to be
a shortened form of the 1cs dative object [= ventive suffix –nim]). Note that between the
first verb in the sequence, lizzizū-ma (in line 21), and this verb, the author has changed the
person in which the gods are addressed from third person to second. Just as “the locking𒁹 A N OB P RAYER TO THE G ODS OF THE N IGHT

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Extispicy is quite well-attested in the Late Bronze Levant, both in the north
(i.e., Ugarit) and the south (Hazor) in the form of Babylonian-style liver models. 1
Despite the ample Late Bronze evidence, however, there is no clear evidence for
the practice in Iron Age Israel or Judah. This is not particularly surprising since
the Akkadian Late Bronze hepatoscopic texts outside of Mesopotamia, and the
non-Akkadian ones they inspired at Ugarit, are the result of the international
exportation of Babylonian scholarship that went hand-in-hand with the Babylo-
nian cultural koiné of the Late Bronze Age. When that international use and ap-
preciation of Babylonian knowledge ended in the tumult of the thirteenth to
twelfth centuries, the mantic exports, in many ways the pinnacle of what would
become ummânūtu (expertise in the scribal craft), ceased as well. Thus, Ezek
21:26 is the only mention of the practice in indisputable terms in the Hebrew
Bible. In this case, the prophet is referring to the decision-making of the Babylo-
nian monarch Nebuchadnezzar II, as he plots his military strategy during his
conquest of Canaan. The king “looked at the liver” ( ‫ד‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ‫כּ‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ָ ) in addition to per-
forming an act of belomancy (divination using arrowheads) and consulting tera-
phim. In the prophet’s presentation, Yahweh has guided the results of the mantic
acts so as to lead the king to conquer Jerusalem. Though Yahweh directs these
undertakings, his presence in them is described as something exceptional—the
1
Twenty-two models of exta, including the inscribed liver models (KTU 1.141, 1.142, 1.143,
1.144, 1.155, and an inscribed lung model, 1.127) have been uncovered at Ugarit (see M. Die-
trich and O. Loretz et al., Mantik in Ugarit: Keilalphabetische Texte der Opferschau, Omensammlun-
gen, Nekromantie [ALASP 3; Münster: Ugarit Verlag, 1990], 5–38) while three inscribed and three
uninscribed fragmentary liver models dating to roughly the Old Babylonian/Middle Babylonian
periods have been discovered at Hazor (W. Horowitz et al., Cuneiform in Canaan: Cuneiform
Sources from the Land of Israel in Ancient Times [Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society/Hebrew
University, 2006], 66–68 and Wayne Horowitz, et al, “Hazor 17: Another Clay Liver Model,” IEJ
60 (2010), 133–45).80Judahites, the prophet tells us, believe the results of Nebuchadnezzar’s divina-
tions are false by their very nature (Ezek 21:28).
Despite the lack of Iron Age archaeological evidence and textual witness,
several scholars have argued that extispicy was practiced in ancient Israel and
Judah. Sigmund Mowinckel claims that certain Psalms were, in fact, oracle ques-
tions posed to Yahweh before the ritual slaughter of an animal whose exta were
to be examined. 2 Specifically, based on its usage in 2 Kgs 16:15 and Ps 5:4,
Mowinckel makes the case that the verb ‫בקר‬ (normally translated “to inquire”) is
a technical term referring to performing an extispicy. 3 Otto Loretz, building on
Mowinckel’s study and citing the liver models from Ugarit as precedent, posits
that the “signs,” ‫אֹתוֹת‬ , mentioned in Ps 74:4, 9 are, in fact, liver omina. 4 Freder-
ick Cryer, looking at the time, location, equipment, procedure, language, and
personnel described in the various descriptions of (condoned) divination in the
Hebrew Bible, maintains that these accounts are modeled on NA extispicy re-
ports and queries and implies that, under the heavily edited biblical narratives
which report them, lies buried the remains of an Israelite hepatoscopic tradi-
tion. 5 Anne Jeffers considers whether the participle ‫ד‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ , “sheep-tender” (used
only twice in the Hebrew Bible, 2 Kgs 3:4 and Amos 1:1), might refer to one
who not only raises sheep, but was actually involved in sacrifice and mantic
liver examination. 6
All of these proposals share certain elementary problems. Why are there no
models of exta known from Iron Age sites in Israel and Judah, though they are
attested in the Late Bronze Age? Why, if the biblical authors use specific tech-
nical terminology to refer to hepatoscopy (i.e., ‫בקר‬ and ‫ד‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ , as per Mowinckel,
Loretz and Jeffers) do they not employ that terminology when referring to the
practice in Ezek 21:26? Even if it is because they reject the foreign, but not do-
mestic, practice of extispicy, the biblical authors are perfectly willing to call
other illegitimate diviners by native technical terms (e.g., prophets of other dei-
ties: 1 Kgs 18:19; 2 Kgs 10:19; Jer 2:8; 23:13; false prophets of Yahweh: 1 Kgs

Frederick Cryer, Divination in Ancient Israel and its Near Eastern Environment: A Socio-Historical
Investigation (JSOTSup 142; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1994), 298–305. Notably, while Cryer astutely
rejects the methods of Mowinckel (296) and Loretz (296–98), he accepts their conclusion that
extispicy was known and practiced in ancient Israel. The fundamental problem with Cryer’s
argument is that all mantic acts include the elements named above to a high degree since all
divinatory acts are rituals conducted by special personnel, which respond in time and place to
specific situations! Celestial divination, for example, for which we also have extensive reports
dating to the NA period, mention all, some, or many of these elements. This does not mean that
the biblical narrative, and ultimately the real practice which lies behind it, is based on Babyloni-
an or native Israelite celestial divination.

22:6). Why the unwillingness in this case? Why, if hepatoscopy was practiced in
Israel and Judah, only later to be condemned and its overt mention eradicated
from the biblical text, is it not mentioned in the list of prohibited diviners in
Deut 18:10–11? Ultimately, all arguments in favor of Israelite and Judahite ex-
tispicy are highly speculative.
Functionally speaking, we are also at a loss to find biblical parallels for this
prayer. While there are several acceptable means of divination in the biblical
tradition, i.e., prophecy, cleromancy, oneiromancy (see 1 Sam 28:6), and quite a
few forbidden ones (Deut 18:10–11), we have no Israelite or Judahite preparato-
ry prayers made for these acts, other than the specific questions posited (e.g., 1
Sam 30:8; 1 Kgs 22:6; and perhaps Psalms 4, 60, 108, 119 and 143). The He-
brew Bible contains narrative descriptions of divination and often its results—
but it is not a diviner’s manual and contains no traces of one. One wonders if
any mantic technical literature (e.g., lists of dream omens or rules for lots), other
than the results of prophecy, was ever committed to writing in Israel and Judah
or if the divinatory traditions were ultimately and exclusively oral.
The thrust of the prayer is a plea for an accurate, truthful extispicy, guided
by the gods. And, though we have no divinatory manuals from ancient Israel,
within the Hebrew Bible we can observe a certain amount of anxiety regarding
the truthfulness of an oracle. According to Deut 18:21–22, a prophet of Yahweh
can only be judged legitimate if the oracles he delivers come to fruition. When
making a decision, of course, it is not much good to know after the fact whether
the oracle relays the truth. Thus, in 1 Kgs 22, the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat,
asks for a second prophetic opinion regarding the joint Judahite-Israelite mili-
tary expedition against Ramoth-Gilead. When the prophet Micaiah ben Imlah is
summoned, his initial oracle confirms the previous one offered unanimously by
four-hundred prophets. But the king of Israel is incredulous and demands that
the prophet offer him the truth in Yahweh’s name (1 Kgs 22:16, ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫ת‬ ‫מ‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ֱ ).
The truthful oracle is decidedly negative and the vision of Yahweh’s court that
the lone prophet recounts indicates that the deity was, in fact, guiding the oracle
of the four-hundred prophets—but not with the truth! Instead, Yahweh deliber-
ately misled the kings by dispatching a “false spirit” ( ‫ר‬ ‫ק‬ ֶ ‫שׁ‬ ֶ ‫רוּח‬
, 1 Kgs 22:22–23).
Though theologically upsetting to many ancient and modern readers, 1 Kgs 22
sheds light on our prayer by revealing that the plea for a truthful extispicy might
not merely be a plea for divine mediation and accuracy in the extispicy proce-
dure, but also a plea for the gods to be honest in guiding their servants!
While there are no real functional parallels in the Hebrew Bible, the concept
that an oracle was a legal decision does have some analogies. It has been noted
since at least the days of Gunkel and Begrich that certain oracles are framed as
lawsuits, i.e., the so-called Gerichtsrede (“Judgment Speech/Oracle”). 7 As stated
above, in the Prayer to the Gods of the Night the night gods serve as an advocate
7
Hermann Gunkel and Joachim Begrich, Introduction to the Psalms: The Genres of the Religious
Lyric of Israel (trans. J. Nogalski; Macon: Mercer University Press, 1998), 279–80.82of the inquirer. In the biblical Judgment Oracle, it is the prophet himself who
acts as a mediator, but in these cases he is representing the plaintiff, i.e., Yah-
weh (e.g., Isa 1:2–20; Mic 6:1–8), and the cosmos acts as witness. 8 Such oracles,
like our prayer, employ legal terminology and concepts, such as “lawsuit” (Mic
6:1, ‫יב‬ ‫)ר‬ ִ and the calling of witnesses, “Listen, O Sky, and pay attention, O Earth,
for Yahweh hereby speaks!” (Isa 1:2a, ‫ר‬ ‫בּ‬ ֵ ‫דּ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫ינוּ‬ ִ‫ז‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫ה‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫עוּ‬ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ). While
this is hardly a profound correlation, it demonstrates that, unsurprisingly, in
both our prayer and certain biblical pericopes the writers conceived of the invis-
ible administration of divine-human relationships in mundane legal terms with
which they were quite familiar.

An OB Ikribu-Like Prayer to Shamash and Adad
A LAN L ENZI
S HAMASH :
See page 197.
A DAD :
Adad (also, Ḫaddu, Ḫadda, Addu, Adda) is the Semitic name of the ancient
Near Eastern storm god par excellence who was responsible for storms, thunder,
lightning, wind, and rain. Worship of this god extended across the entire ancient
Near East under various other names, such as Ishkur (Sum.), Teshub (Hurrian),
Baʿlu (Ugaritic), and Taru/Tarḫun(t) (Hattic/Hittite-Luwian). In Mesopotamian
traditions, he was the son of Anu or sometimes Enlil, his consort was Shala
(identified with Sum. Medimsha), and his ministers were Shullat and Ḫanish.
Iconographically, Adad was represented by a lion-dragon in third millennium
sources and a bull by OB times. In anthropomorphic depictions, he is frequently
found holding a weapon or a lightning bolt, as if ready to strike an opponent in
battle. Although his name is usually written with the logogram IŠKUR , a sign that
can be read as the Sumerian word im, “wind,” one also finds it written syllabi-
cally in Akkadian and sometimes logographically as d 10 .
Adad was syncretized to the Sumerian storm god Ishkur during the Sargonic
and Ur III periods (i.e., the late third millennium) and became a major power in
the Mesopotamian pantheon by OB times. His shrines and temples were quite
numerous throughout Mesopotamia, Syria (e.g., at Ebla, Mari, Emar, Ḫalab, and
Ugarit), and beyond, extending chronologically from Early Dynastic to Hellenis-
tic times. Prominent examples of sanctuaries include the double Anu-Adad tem-
ple in Ashur, dating back to the reign of Shamshi-Adad I, and Adad’s most im-
portant Babylonian shrine—according to first millennium sources—located at
Zabban (90km east of the Tigris and 175km southeast of Ashur).
Given Adad’s sphere of power, it can be no surprise that he was both pro-
ductive and destructive to humans, bringing abundance, on the one hand, via
8586rain that watered crops and animals (see, e.g., Atram-ḫasīs II i 11–16, 30–33), 1
and wreaking devastation, on the other, with powerful storms and floods (see,
e.g., Atram-ḫasīs III ii 48–55). 2 Due to the latter association, Adad was an im-
portant war god, especially evident among Middle and Neo-Assyrian sources.
Along with his role as a storm god, Adad was also a guardian of oaths. In
Sippar, for example, he was closely associated with Shamash, who together with
Adad was invoked to bear witness to legal cases and contracts. This must be
significant for their association in divinatory texts, attested as early as OB
times. 3
To explain Adad’s rather unexpected role in oracular divination, Daniel
Schwemer offers two suggestions. First, Adad “was a celestial god who . . . had
power over numerous ominous phenomena and dwelled in immediate proximity
to the celestial sun-god.” And second, he “was lord of the winds, which were
seen in Mesopotamia as the divine carriers,” 4 perhaps thereby providing the
means to communicate the extispicy verdict to the human diviner. 5
T HE P RAYER :
This OB prayer was used in the diviner’s extispicy ritual to petition the high
gods in charge of the oracular decision: Shamash and Adad. (It is closely associ-
ated with the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night, see page 71). After the diviner
had gathered the gods via this prayer and made them amenable to hear inquir-
ies, the diviner may have made his inquiry in the form of a tamitu-prayer (see
page 465). In order to learn the answer to his inquiry, the diviner would exam-
ine the animal sacrificed in the extispicy and read the signs that the gods had
placed in its exta. In this way, the diviner could learn the will of the gods in the
matter about which he had inquired.
The prayer falls into two main parts. In the first ten lines the diviner under-
takes his ritual purification. 6 In the remainder of the text (lines 11–66), the di-
viner performs six more ritual actions, directed at Shamash alone, and asks
Shamash, 7 sometimes including Adad, eight times in the course of the prayer to

50, 51, 54, 55, and 58. Adad is mentioned only six times: lines 11, 27, 36, 44, 51, 55, always in
tandem with an invocation of Shamash. Only Shamash is invoked at the beginning of each of
seven ritual actions described in the text (see lines 1, 14, 19, 25, 34, 42, 50; and Starr, 46).𒁹𒁹 A N OB I KRIBU -L IKE P RAYER TO S HAMASH AND A DAD

tion with a firm reply via the placing of a sign in the exta of the animal being
sacrificed (see YOS 11 23:16). 8
The preparations mentioned in lines 1–10 apparently form a rite of purifica-
tion (see line 9), making the diviner worthy to approach the place of extispicy,
the place to which the gods are summoned. 9 Cedar plays a major role in this
process of purification but the precise significance of its various uses is not at all
clear. One assumes the aromatic qualities of cedar or cedar resin figure into the
process somehow.
The remainder of the prayer is highly repetitive, but its presentation shows
a very clear logic. Lines 11–66 describe the ritual preparations of a meal for the
gods (see Starr, 57): incense makes the air pleasant to smell, 10 water is offered
for washing the hands, food is laid out, and the guests are announced. 11 After the
initial preparation (incense and water, lines 11–24), the gods are to come to the
table, eat, sit on thrones, and render a judgment (see lines 29–30, 38–39, and
45b–48a). In or during their meal the gods, now present and happily sated by
their repast, were requested to leave a sign in the sacrificed animal in response
to the diviner’s oracular inquiry, perhaps asked after this prayer in the form of a
tamitu-prayer. The diviner would then find and interpret the sign in the animal’s
exta to learn the gods’ decision.
The present prayer is similar to the ikribu-prayers discussed in the general
introduction (see page 46), even being included among a list of such prayers by
Mayer (UFBG, 32, n.63). Yet it is not an ikribu-prayer, properly speaking. As
Starr writes:
The OB Prayer . . . deviates in form from the standard ikribu. It does not begin
with the opening formula . . . , but with a vivid description of how the diviner
uses cedar (resin, most likely) for purposes of cultic purification, and the whole
ritual (lines 1–10) is addressed to Šamaš alone. Only the second unit (line 11ff.)

tion.

Compare, e.g., the ritual and ikribu-prayers in Zimmern, BBR, nos. 75–78. On meals in Meso-
potamia generally, see J. J. Glassner, “Mahlzeit. A. In Mesopotamien,” RlA 7 (1987–1990), 259–
67. On meals for the gods, see the overview in W. G. Lambert, “Donations of Food and Drink to
the Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia,” in Ritual and Sacrifice in the Ancient Near East (ed. J.
Quaegebeur; OLA 55; Leuven: Peeters, 1993), 191–201 and A. Leo Oppenheim’s classic presenta-
tion “The Care and Feeding of the Gods” in his Ancient Mesopotamia: Portraits of a Dead Civiliza-
tion (rev. Erica Reiner; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977), 183–98.88opens with the introductory formula of the ikribus. Here too, the text deviates
from the latter by placing the closing formula (ina ikrib akarrabu, etc.) imme-
diately after the opening formula (line 12). In short, while the OB Prayer is con-
structed along the lines of an ikribu, employing identical formulas and describing
a set of activities of the diviner, it bears neither the title ikribu, nor does it em-
ploy the (opening and closing) formulas in the orthodox manner. . . . From this
we should draw the conclusion that not all prayers of the diviner are ikribus, alt-
hough they may appear to be so. 12

Although not commenting on our text at length—though it is mentioned several times, these
studies contextualize the present prayer within the activities of the diviner as represented in
other ritual texts, including other OB prayers of the diviner (see especially Starr, 44–60).

Line 1: UTU = Šamaš, the sun god. Notice the brief invocation. The diviner regularly
came before Shamash and Adad during extispicies. Perhaps this familiarity explains the
lack of an elaborate hymnic introduction (salutation). Alternatively, one could suggest that
ritual acts (and their description in the prayer) serve as the introductory motif. The diviner
shows himself to be ritually prepared to meet with the gods of divination. Šakānum, “to

whether the diviner put the actual cedar wood or only cedar resin in his mouth (see CAD
E, 279 for this general ambiguity). Ellum, “pure, clear.”
Šamaš ašakkan ana pīya erēnam ellam
Line 2: Goetze read the first word as a-ṣa-ni-ip-ku, but there is no known root
*ṣanāpum in Akkadian. As others have since recognized, the verb is sanābum (or sanāpum),
“to tie” (see CAD S, 132–33). The pronominal suffix on the verb is a 2ms dative without
mimation, as also in lines 8 and 54 (compare line 3). Ina, “in, on, by, from, with.” Itqum,
“fleece, tuft, lock (of hair).” Pērtum (pirtum), “hair (of head).” According to CAD P, 415,
itiq pērtim means “forelock,” which refers to the hair that covers one’s forehead. The object
of the verb must be implied from context (see lines 1 and 7). It is not clear what exactly
the diviner is doing with his hair. Is he tying a piece of cedar into his hair or is he using a
piece of his hair as a binding?
asannibku ina itiq pērtīya
Line 3: The verb from line 1 is repeated here, but this time it has the 2ms pronominal
suffix (with mimation). The text’s a-ša-ka-an-ku-um is a morphographemic writing since
the final radical of the root, n, would have assimilated to the following consonant in
speech (–nk– becomes –kk–). Sūnum, “lap, loin.”
ašakkakkum ina sūnīya
Line 4: The meaning of šabium (šabû) is unknown. Goetze translates it as “compact”
(with a note on 27–28) while Foster renders it “bushy,” but the lexica do not even attempt
a gloss. It seems to describe cedar somehow, either as a substantive in construct, a preced-
ing adjective, or an appositive. See CAD Š/1, 17 for a brief discussion. In any case, this line
provides the object of the verb in line 3.
šabiam erēnam
Line 5: Mesûm, “to wash, to purify.” U, “and.” Qātum, “hand.” Notice the verbs in this
line and the next two have changed to preterites (from the previous duratives). These may
indicate that the diviner purified himself before the prayer in preparation to meet with the
gods. Washing the hands and mouth as a ritual preparation is found relatively frequently
in the Mesopotamian ritual materials. One did not want to offend the gods with filthy
hands and bad breath (see van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction, 33–34).

Line 7: See lines 1 and 2. How the action here relates to the action of line 2 is un-
clear. Does the diviner repeat in line 2 during the prayer the action that he had already
done prior to speaking it (recounted here)?
asnib erēnam ellam ina itiq pērtīya
Line 8: Goetze read the first word as al-ta-ba-ak-ku but this did not supply adequate
sense. As Seux notes (467), Erica Reiner suggested the present reading, deriving the verb
from šapākum, “to heap up, to pile, to pour on.” The form is a 1cs perfect. Again, we see
the 2ms dative pronominal suffix without mimation.
altappakku šabiam erēnam
Line 9: The form of ellum is a 1cs predicative. Puḫrum, “assembly.” Ilum, “god.”
Ṭeḫûm, “to approach, to be(come) near to.” It is unclear whether the prepositional phrase
in this line should be read with the first or the second verb, but the meaning, on either
reading, is very similar. Having completed his preparations, the diviner is in a state of
purity. He may now approach the divine assembly for their decision (see line 10). The
prayer is performative in that his speaking it initiates his approach.
ellēku ana puḫur ilī eṭeḫḫi
Line 10: Dīnum, “decision, judgment.” The diviner purifies himself and ritually enters
the divine assembly to obtain their decision with regard to his inquiry. The answer, of
course, is delivered via extispicy.
ana dīnim
Line 11: The diviner renews the invocation but now includes Adad (= d IŠKUR ) with
Shamash. Bēlum, “lord.” Ikribum generally means “prayer, blessing,” but see the next line.
The word is best taken here as a plural. Bīrum, “divination” (both the act of extispicy and
the answer received). Goetze (25) suggests the missing mimation on this final word of the
line is due to the lack of space on the tablet. This is the only instance where it is missing
(see otherwise lines 27, 37, 45, 52, and 56). The epithets bēl dīnim and bēl bīrim are ap-
plied to Shamash and Adad a millennium later in the SB tamitu-prayers (see Lambert,
Babylonian Oracle Questions and page 465 in this book) and ikribu-prayers (see Zimmern,
BBR, nos. 75–101 [pp. 190–219]).

Line 12: Karābum, “to pray, to bless, to greet,” generally, but with its cognate,
ikribum, the idiom means “to utter a prayer, a blessing,” and probably refers here to “the
ritual-cum-prayer part, i.e., the various cultic activities and prayers associated with the
ritual of the diviner, which are usually described in the subscript to each ikribu” (Starr,
50). Têrtum, “message, instruction, omen, extispicy.” The gods make their will known via
the têrtum that they place on the exta of the sheep. With the verb epēšum, “to do, to make,”
the idiom means “to perform an extispicy” (Starr, 50). In both phrases that comprise our
line, we do not simply have a verb and its object. Rather, we have a prepositional phrase
whose substantive is the object of the verb to which it is bound (thereby forming brief
relative clauses): “in the X, which I do.” This explains the subjunctive –u on both verbs.
ina ikrib akarrabu ina têrti ēpušu
Line 13: Kittum, “truth.” Šuknam is the ms imperative of šakānum with a ventive. This
statement, which appears numerous times throughout the prayer, is “an appeal for the
manifestation of the oracular verdict” (Starr, 58).
kittam šuknam
Line 14: Qutrēnum (qutrīnum, qutrinnum), “incense.” Pî qutrēnim is obscure, though it
may refer to the opening of the flask containing incense (see Seux, 468, n.10). Foster takes
qutrēnim as the object of the verb. But this understanding must assume a mistaken case
vowel on qutrēnim. In any case, the diviner again invokes Shamash and places pure cedar
(see line 15) “to the mouth” of something, as in line 1.
Šamaš ašakkan ana pî qutrēnim
Line 15: The restoration in this line follows CAD Q, 324. Ša, “which,” introduces a
brief relative clause that further describes the pî qutrēnim in line 14. Maḫrīka, “before you,
in front of you.” Erēnam ellam is the direct object of the verb in line 14. (W)ašābum, “to sit,
to dwell, to reside.” When used with smoke-like things, “linger” seems an appropriate
translation of the verb (see Goetze, 26 and Foster, 209). Goetze suggests the missing mi-
mation on the final noun is simply due to the lack of space on the tablet (see 25).
ša maḫrīka erēnam ellam lišib qutrēnu
Line 16: Qerûm, “to call, to invite.” The ventive on the precative indicates the diviner
wishes to summon the gods to his present location. The subject of the verb should be un-
derstood as the incense mentioned in the previous line. As Goetze has written, “[t]he fra-
grance of the burned cedar is supposed to stay for a while and to bring the gods to the9217. i-na ik-ri-ib a-ka-ra-bu i-na te-er-ti e-pu-šu

Line 19: The invocation is renewed yet again, though only to Shamash. Našûm, “to lift
up, to raise.” Goetze reads the text as if the verb were a durative with a 2ms dative pro-
nominal suffix, anaššīkum. But the copy (YOS 11 22:19) does not show an initial A. Before
positing a scribal omission, one should note that the same orthography appears in lines 25,
34, 42, and 50 (thus the understanding of the same verb in line 25 by CAD L, 206, <a>-
na-ši-ku-um, is atomistic and unlikely; see a different solution in CAD P, 408 on line 42). As
Goetze has suggested for line 25, na-ši-ku-um stands here for našiākkum, an apocopated 1cs
predicative with 2ms dative suffix. In support of this, he writes, “[t]he corresponding form
with plural suffix na-ši-a-ku-nu-ši-im is actually found in AO 7032 (RA 38 87 [see now
Starr, 122:2]) and from there to be restored in YBT XI 2 obv.2” [=YOS 11 2:2, for which
see Starr, 30:2] (29). Even if Goetze is correct, we do not know why the scribe used this
odd orthography in all four instances of the verb in this text. Mû (always pl.), “water.”
ÍD . IDIGNA = Idiqlat, “Tigris.” ÍD . BURANUN (UD-KIB-NUN)- NA = Purattum, “Euphrates.”
Šamaš našîkkum ? mê Idiqlat u Purattim
Line 20: The relative ša refers back to mê in line 19. Ištu, “from, out of.” Šadûm,
“mountain(s).” GIŠ . ŠU . ÚR . MÌN = šurmēnum, “cypress.” Goetze’s GIŠ . SU - ÚR - MÌN in the text (26)
is corrected in the notes (29). Cedar and cypress occur together frequently in rituals of the
diviner (see Goetze, 29).
ša ištu šadîm erēnam u šurmēnam
Line 21: Kâšim is the 2ms independent dative pronoun, “to, for you.” Babālum, “to
carry, to bring.” The verb is a transitive parsāku form—identical in appearance to the pre-
dicative; cedar and cypress (from line 20) are its direct objects. It ends the subordinate
clause begun with the ša in line 20. Mutassûm (Dt of mesûm), “to wash oneself.” Mutissi is a
ms imperative. Qurādum, “hero, warrior.” The washing here and in the next couple of lines
is in preparation for eating the sacrificial meal that the diviner lays out before the gods.

Line 23: Attā, “you” (ms). Mutissi in line 21 is the same verb form as mutessi here.
Bunene is the chief minister (and sometimes son) of Shamash (see Goetze, 29, citing Zim-
mern, BBR 1–20, line 105 [p. 102]: Bunene sukkal Šamaš u Aya, “Bunene, vizier of Sha-
mash and Aya”). Našparum, “messenger, envoy.” The form of the noun is due to the fact
that the word is bound to kittim in the following line.
u attā mutessi Bunene našpar
Line 24: Although kittum means “truth,” its being bound to a preceding noun (našpar
in line 23) as it is here might be better rendered in English with an adj. preceding the
translation of našpar. Thus, instead of the literalistic “messenger of truth,” one might trans-
late the construction as “reliable messenger.” Maḫar is the bound form of maḫrum used in
line 15. Bunene is to wash himself in front of Shamash. Dayyānum, “judge.” Shamash’s role
as judge is quite typical. He decides the case put before the gods in the form of an ex-
tispicy.
kittim maḫar Šamaš dayyānim
Line 25: For the verb na-ši-ku-um, see line 19. Liqtum, “gathered material, selection, a
quality item, gift.” Luqut is an imperative, probably derived from laqātum, “to pick up, to
gather, to collect.” This is the understanding of our line in CAD L, 206 (under liqtu). Odd-
ly, the entry for laqātu in the CAD does not cite our line. The direct object of the impera-
tive follows in line 26.
Šamaš našîkkum ? liqtam luqut
Line 26: Mû, see line 19. Saskûm (sasqûm) is a fine flour, often used in rituals. Mê
saskîm can be drunk (see CAD S, 193). It is probably, therefore, some kind of liquid con-
coction comprised of saskû-flour and water that one can drink or pour out as a libation
offering. Ellūtim is plural and therefore must modify mê not saskîm.

NA 4 . ZA . GÌN = uqnûm, “lapis lazuli.” The participles in this line both seem to describe Adad
(notice that the participle is singular), whose divine dining furniture is made from precious
materials. But given Adad’s secondary position in this prayer, perhaps the participles are
best understood as describing Shamash (see also the series of 2ms verbs that follow this
line).
wāšib kussî ḫurāṣim ākil paššur uqnîm
Line 29: All three verbs in this line are G 2ms duratives, derived from (w)arādum, “to
go down, to descend,” akālum, “to eat,” and (w)ašābum, respectively. Although the verbs
sound descriptive here, simply telling us what the god is going to do, these words are in
fact directed at the god. They are probably best understood as telling the god what he is
supposed to do (see Foster’s translation, 210). Likewise for the verb in line 30.
turradam takkal tuššab
Line 30: The opening prepositional phrase describes where Shamash (Adad?) is to sit
(see line 29). Diānum (dânu), “to judge, to render a verdict.” Note the cognate accusative

ter translates the word as “courtyard” (210), citing Andrew George as his source (211), but
it is unclear what actually stands behind that suggestion. One would presume kisallu,
“courtyard,” but its logogram does not fit the sign we have in the copy unless we suppose
KISAL ! . In the gap at the end of the line, we expect a verb in the subjunctive, as in lines 21

there are still unsolved issues with the pronunciation and syntax of numbers, the normali-
zation given here is an approximation. By “seven and seven,” the text means seven pairs.

(pirkum) is unclear. In other contexts, the word may refer to a transverse line or the chord
of a circle (in mathematical texts), a part of a gate, or a region/territory. Foster (210) sug-
gests “row” for its meaning here (likewise Seux, 469, n.16), which seems contextually
appropriate. As the word is in the accusative, Ghanem proposes to read it adverbially,96

modifying the verb parākum, “to lie across transversely” (here a 3mp predicative). The
next word, šina, “two,” is likewise to be understood adverbially (“by twos”). Thus, perkī
šina may indicate a dual row-like arrangement of the bread. Until perku is clarified, how-
ever, the precise arrangement will remain unclear.

Line 50: After the by-now-familiar opening invocation and verb (see also lines 19, 25,
and 42), the line should read ḫi-iṣ-ba-am rather than Goetze’s ḫi-iš-ba-am (likewise, line
54). Ḫiṣbum, “plenty, abundant yield.” As the next line implies, this “plenty” is to be iden-
tified as grain.

Lines 51–53: Nuwwurum, “brilliance” (only recognized by CDA, 259). d NÍSABA ( d NAGA),

Line 54: Ušnālku is a 1cs Š durative with a 2ms dative pronominal suffix (without
mimation, as in lines 2 and 8). The verb is derived from itūlum (utūlu, niālum, nâlu), which
in the Š stem means “to make someone lie down, sleep, to lay something down.” For the
remainder of the line, see the notes on lines 50–51.

Line 58: The copy shows that the scribe has mistakenly added an UM to the end of
the line. Goetze believes this UM should have been placed at the end of qurādu, which is
lacking mimation (see 25, n.1 and 27, n.9). Šib is the ms imperative of (w)ašābum. Lišbū is
the 3mp precative of the same verb (compare the 3cs in line 15). The subject is announced
in line 59. Qurādum, see line 21.

Line 61: Nergal is a chthonic deity, who rules over pestilence and war (see page 339).
Bēl X is a common construction in Akkadian. When referring to humans bēl may designate
a person responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows, whether an office, object, or
something more abstract (see CAD B, 198; e.g., bēl šutummi, “steward of the storehouse,”
bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” or bēl dabābi, “adversary” [lit. “owner of a lawsuit”]). Similarly
with deities (see CAD B, 193). For example, Ea is called bēl pirištim, “lord of the secret
council,” in an OB text from Malgium. The phrase bēl kakkī, “lord of weapons,” identifies
Nergal quite appropriately as an expert wielder of weapons.
Nergal bēl kakkī
Line 62: d INANA = Ištar. Ishtar was the goddess of war and sex (see page 169). Bēltum,
“lady,” is the feminine form of bēlum and implies the same idea of power and authority as
that of its masculine form. Tāḫāzum, “battle, combat.” Bēlet tāḫāzim is a common epithet
for Ishtar (see CAD T, 47).
Ištar bēlet tāḫāzim
Line 63: For the verb, see line 58. Lines 60–63 compare to lines 58b–59. In the latter,
the verb comes first, followed by the prepositional phrase and subject. In lines 60–63 we
have the exact opposite order: the compound subject is in lines 60–62 with the verb and
prepositional phrase following in line 63.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The suggestions offered in the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night (see page
79) supply a broad comparative view on the issue of extispicy and divination.
The following will focus on two particular issues only briefly: the use of cedar in
Mesopotamian and biblical rituals and the idea of humans feeding the gods.
Given the concerns for ritual purity among religious leaders the world over,
it is not at all surprising that both ancient Mesopotamian and biblical texts spec-𒁹𒁹 A N OB I KRIBU -L IKE P RAYER TO S HAMASH AND A DAD
99
ify the need for ritual officials to purify themselves before engaging in ritual
activities. The means to do so in both cultures were very often similar. For ex-
ample, washing with water, shaving, and laundering one’s clothing were means
of purification in both Mesopotamian and biblical texts. 1 What is distinctive
when comparing Mesopotamian and biblical materials with regard to cedar (and
its products) is just how different the two cultures treated this kind of wood. In
Mesopotamia, cedar and its resin were used fairly frequently in ritual and medi-
cal texts as a material for figurines and a ritual substance, whether burned as
incense or rubbed on/held in one’s body as a purifying agent (see CAD E, 276–
79). It is striking that the biblical ritual corpora preserve only a few references
to the role of cedar (BH ‫ז‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫)א‬.
Only in the rituals for the purification of “leprosy”
(i.e., scale disease, Lev 14) and corpse contamination (the red heifer ritual, Num
19) does cedar play a role (see Lev 14:4, 6, 49, 51, 52 and Num 19:6). And even
in these two cases cedar is quite secondary, a mere additive to the blood that
acts as the real ritual detergent. In fact, Milgrom goes so far as to say that cedar
was chosen for these particular rituals because of its reddish color and thus its
association with blood (note also the use of a crimson yarn). 2 There is no indica-
tion that such a symbolic association between blood and cedar existed in Meso-
potamia. 3 Rather, one gets the impression that it was the aromatic nature of the
wood that commended its ritual use.
Our prayer very clearly sets up a meal for the gods, around which they
gather, eat, and then pronounce judgment. This explicitly anthropomorphic rep-
resentation of the gods eating a meal has a close counterpart in the sacrificial
practices depicted throughout the Hebrew Bible. Although a full presentation is
not possible here, a few key pieces of evidence will make the case rather clear.
Yahweh was offered a combination of meat, grain, and wine—things that look
very much like the elements of a meal—every morning and evening (see Exod
29:38–42). The sacrifices and offerings prescribed by ritual texts are often called
“food” (‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֶ ‫ל‬,
e.g., Lev 3:11, 16, 21:6, 8, 21, 22, and 28:2, 24). Yahweh’s altar is
sometimes called a table (see Mal 1:7, where there is the mention of food [‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֶ ‫]ל‬
and a parallel between ‫י‬ ‫ח‬ ִ ‫בּ‬ ְ ְ‫ז‬ ‫מ‬ ִ and ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ן‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫;שׁ‬
see also v. 12). Finally, Yahweh’s
offerings are very frequently described as a “pleasing aroma” to him ( ‫יחוֹח‬
ִ‫נ‬ ‫יח‬ ַ ‫;ר‬ ֵ
see Gen 8:21; Exod 29:18, 25, 41; Lev 1:9, 13, 17, 2:2, 9, 12, 3:5, 16, 4:31, 6:15,
21, 8:21, 28, 17:6, 23:13, 18; Num 15:3, 7, 10, 13, 14, 24, 18:17, Num 28:2, 6,
8, 13, 24, 27, and 29:2, 6, 8, 13, 36). Although there are very vocal statements
(that get a lot of attention from modern scholars) in opposition to the view (see,
e.g., the strong statement in Ps 50:12–14 and prophetic critiques in, e.g., Isa

van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction, 27–36. For a thorough discussion of ritual purity in the legisla-
tion of the Hebrew Bible, especially the pentateuchal Priestly Source, see David P. Wright, “Un-

But as blood did not factor significantly into Mesopotamian rituals, this is not unexpected.1001:11–14, 4 Jer 7:21–13, Amos 5:21–25, and Mic 6:6–8), it seems unavoidable to
conclude that at least for some biblical authors sacrifices provided Yahweh with
food. 5
4
Note, however, the use of the word ‫שׂבע‬, “to be sated,” in Isa 1:11, a word generally used of
being sated with food and drink.
See the discussion in Gary A. Anderson, “Sacrifice and Sacrificial Offerings (OT),” ABD 5:870–
86, especially 872 and 881–82.

An OB Letter-Prayer to Ninmug
A LAN L ENZI
N INMUG :
We know very little about Ninmug, if that is the correct reading of her
name. 1 She was a minor goddess in Mesopotamia, often associated with crafts-
manship and birth. In some traditions, including our text, Ninmug is the wife of
Ishum/Ḫendursaga. In Enki and the World Order, line 406, she is mentioned
among several other goddesses as a sister of Enki (Akk. Ea). A handful of early
texts bears witness to Ninmug’s cult at Mesopotamian sites such as Fara, perhaps
Kisiga, Adab, Lagash, and Umma. Several Old Babylonian cylinder seal legends
and the present letter-prayer indicate that her veneration continued into the
second millennium. 2
T HE P RAYER :
As the opening few lines make clear, this short prayer was written in episto-
lary form. The language in the opening displays the same kind of social hierar-
chy as one might find in a letter addressed to royalty by a loyal subject: “your
servant” (waradki) writes to “my lady” (bēltīya). Unlike many other prayers in
this volume that contain long preliminary praise or extensive lamentation and
petition, this letter-prayer gets to the point rather quickly (lines 5–7). Ninmug is
simply asked to intercede on behalf of Ninurta-qarrad, the (male) supplicant,
with her husband, Ishum. Apparently the supplicant believes Ishum is the one
who has the authority to change his situation. It is not at all atypical for a god-
1
See Cavigneaux and Krebernik, 471.
According to Cavigneaux and Krebernik this early goddess may be related to a later male deity,
d
Nin-MUG (473). This later deity, whose name is probably to be read d Nin-zadim, played a role in
the Mīs pî ritual complexes. See Christopher Walker and Michael Dick, The Induction of the Cult
Image in Ancient Mesopotamia: The Mesopotamian Mīs Pî Ritual (SAALT 1; Helsinki: The Neo-
Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2001), 23, n.69 and throughout; see also Angelika Berlejung, Die
Theologie der Bilder: Herstellung und Einweihung von Kultbildern in Mesopotamien und die alttesta-
mentliche Bilderpolemik (OBO 162; Freiburg: Universitätsverlag / Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &
Ruprecht, 1998), 126.

105106dess to intercede with a god she can influence (line 4) on behalf of a supplicant
(see, e.g., the prayer to Gula on page 243).
Interestingly, more than half of the prayer (lines 8–19) consists of the sup-
plicant’s promise to give thanks to the goddess after she has interceded for him
(notice the inūma, “when, at that time,” in lines 8 and 15). Giving thanks is both
material and verbal: the supplicant will bring a sacrifice for Ishum and a sheep
for Ninmug, but he will also “proclaim the praises” (dalīlī dalālu) of both deities.
The latter phrase is something one sees quite often in various Akkadian prayers.

Lines 1–3: The first three lines of the text show a typical epistolary opening formula.
Ana, “to.” Bēltum, “lady,” which in this case is a goddess. d NIN . MUG = Ninmug, the goddess
to whom the letter is directed. Qabûm, “to say, to speak.” Umma is a particle that introduc-
es direct speech. One may translate it “thus says” or “PN says as follows.” The one speak-
ing is identified after the particle. Ninurta-qarrad is the proper name of the supplicant.
Wardum, “servant.”

Lines 4–7: Qabâki is an infinitive with a 2fs pronominal suffix; it is the object of the
verb at the end of line 4. Ishum is the husband of Ninmug and the god with whom she is
requested to intercede. Šemûm, “to hear, to listen to.” Line 4 provides the pre-existing basis
for the petition in lines 5–7. Annītum, “this.” Ḫiṭītum, “shortfall, loss, sin.” Ša introduces a
subordinate clause that modifies ḫiṭītim. Wabālum often means “to carry, to bring” (see line𒁹𒁹𒁹 A N OB L ETTER -P RAYER TO N INMUG

12); but in this context it means “to commit” a sin (see CAD A/1, 18). Qātum, “hand.” Itti,
“with.” Leqûm, “to take.” Qatam leqûm is an idiom meaning “to stand surety for someone,”
which in this context suggests intercession. The beneficiary of the action is indicated by
the pronominal suffix on the noun. The ubiquitous presentation scene on cylinder seals
provides visual confirmation of this description of intercession. In these scenes, a lamassu
leads a human by the hand into the presence of a seated deity or king.
qabâki Išum išemmi ana annītim ḫiṭītim ša ublam qatātīya itti Išum liqea
Lines 8–14: Inūma, “when,” introduces a temporal clause that extends to the end of
line 9. This clause sets up the prior condition for the main clause in lines 10–14. Telteqe is
the G perf. of leqûm. The preposition ina can be translated many ways; here it means
“with.” Pānīn, “face,” is in the oblique dual case. Namrum, “bright, radiant.” “A bright
face” is usually understood to refer to a person’s emotional disposition. Without detracting
from this interpretation, one may also consider the possibility that this imagery derived
from the fact that a person would normally anoint themselves with oil as part of their
daily hygienic practices. A person in mourning or doing penance would not carry out this
daily routine; rather, they would display their sorrow or contrition via their unkempt ap-
pearance. Notice the adj. is not nawrum as one might expect in an OB context. Nīqium,
“sacrifice, offering.” U, “and.” Kâšim, “to, for you.” UDU . NÍTA = immerum, “sheep.”
inūma qatātīya talteqe ina pānīn namrūtim ana Išum nīqiam ubbalam u ana kâšim

Lines 15–19: Lines 15–17 contain a temporal clause that introduces the time frame
(rather than prior condition) of the main clause in lines 18–19. Dalīlū, “praises.” Ana
maḫar, “in front of, in the presence of.” Dalālum, “to praise.” Adallalu bears the subjunctive
–u because the verb ends the subordinate clause that began with line 15. Dalīlī dalālum is a
cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same
root. One should translate this idiomatically, “to proclaim praises” or the like. The final
verb is a 1cs precative and is ubiquitous in Akkadian prayers of all periods.
inūma dalīlī ana maḫar Išum adallalu u dalīlīki ludlul
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The idea of presenting a petitionary letter to a deity follows logically from
the dominant social model upon which ancient Near Eastern concepts of deity
were generally based, the royal elites of society. Letters addressed to the king108from subjects for the purpose of obtaining something (sometimes of only person-
al importance) are commonplace in the ancient record. It therefore seems quite
reasonable to apply the same idea to deities. If one wants something, one writes
to the deity and sends it to their house (a temple) for their perusal.
Although we do not find letter-prayers in the Hebrew Bible, 1 we do have a
case in 2 Kgs 19:14–19, where a king, Hezekiah, takes a letter that he himself
received from a foreign king, Sennacherib, to the temple of the Israelite god,
Yahweh, in order to petition the god to assistant him against the threats of the
foreign king. It is significant that this text mentions the fact that Hezekiah
spread the letter out in front of Yahweh (v. 14; ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫הוּ‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫ק‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ח‬ ִ ‫הוּ‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫פ‬ ְ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫)ו‬. 2 Whatev-
er “before Yahweh” may have meant precisely to the biblical author (or in his-
torical Judah at the end of the eighth century BCE ), Hezekiah intends for Yahweh
to see and hear the letter along with his own prayer, as his petitions in v. 16
make clear, so that Yahweh will act accordingly. Although the presentation of
this human letter to the Israelite god is not a precise parallel to our Mesopota-
mian letter-prayer, the idea of placing a letter in front of the Israelite god bears
a striking resemblance to the mentality that gave rise to the letter-prayer in an-
cient Mesopotamia
1
Building on the suggestions of earlier scholars, William Hallo has cautiously connected Hezeki-
ah’s ‫ב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫מ‬,
“letter,” mentioned in Isa 38:9 to the Sumerian letter-prayer tradition. See William W.
Hallo, “The Royal Correspondence of Larsa: I. A Sumerian Prototype for the Prayer of Hezeki-
ah?” in Kramer Anniversary Volume: Cuneiform Studies in Honor of Samuel Noah Kramer (ed. B. L.
Eichler; AOAT 25; Kevelaer: Butzon & Bercker / Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1976), 209–
24; repr. in William W. Hallo, The World’s Oldest Literature: Studies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres (Cul-
ture and History of the Ancient Near East 35; Boston/Leiden: Brill, 2010), 333–51. But Hallo
recognizes that ‫ב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ should probably be read here as ‫ם‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫מ‬,
“inscription,” a word found among
the superscriptions in the Psalter (see Pss 16 and 57–60), and that the content of its text, given
in vv. 10–20, is not a letter at all.
2
Is it significant that the BH verb used here to describe Hezekiah’s placement of the letter is
used elsewhere to describe a ritual gesture of the hands in prayer? See, e.g., 2 Kgs 8:22, HALOT,
976, and page 239 in this volume.

An OB Royal Hymn to Ishtar
A LAN L ENZI
I SHTAR :
See page 169.
T HE H YMN :
This OB hymn to Ishtar comprises fourteen quatrains, each separated from
the next by an inscribed line on the tablet. 1 The first ten praise Ishtar (lines 1–
40). The remaining four (lines 41–56) turn attention to the king the hymn was
to benefit: Ammiditana (1683–1647 BCE ), the great-grandson of Hammurabi. A
three line refrain (lines 57–59) and a rubric (line 60) complete the text.
The first ten stanzas fall into two equal parts, marked formally by a recur-
ring pattern: the first two stanzas of each half (i, ii, vi, and vii) utilize the so-
called Sumerian hymnic style; the other three do not (iii–v and viii–x). As one
will see, the Sumerian hymnic style in a quatrain consists of two nearly identical
couplets. The first couplet describes the deity, identifying her with only a gener-
ic term (e.g., iltam); the second couplet repeats the first verbatim but replaces
the generic term with the deity’s proper name (see also the hymn to Marduk in
Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 1–4, page 485 in this volume). Thematically-speaking, each
half of the first ten stanzas focuses on different aspects of the goddess. Stanzas i–
v center on the description of her person, lauding her greatness, her sexuality,
her loveliness, her intelligence, and her personality. Stanzas vi–x center on the
description of her position among the gods, celebrating her greatness (compare
stanza i), her word/authority, her title and rank, her equality to Anu, and her
court. Considered as a whole, the ten stanzas present a full picture of the god-
dess, personally and professionally.
The final four stanzas of the text deal with Ishtar’s beneficence to Am-
miditana. The first stanza depicts the king’s piety, showing him worthy of the
heavenly queen’s favor. 2 The second and third stanzas describe Ishtar’s interces-
1
Eight stanzas appear on the obverse and six on the reverse of the only tablet attesting the text.
Note how stanza xi introduces Ammiditana: first generically in line 41 and then by name in
line 43—a partial imitation of the Sumerian hymnic style used for Ishtar. It is also worthy of
2
111112sion on his behalf with Anu and her gift of long life to him as well as universal
dominion—both common desires of Mesopotamian kings (see, e.g., Nebuchad-
nezzar’s royal prayer on page 475). The last stanza reflexively describes the
hymn itself and how the king’s recitation of it will elicit a blessing from Ea, god
of wisdom (see page 227).
The final three lines of the text form what line 60 calls “its antiphonal,”
perhaps the refrain that would be used in antiphonal recitations of the hymn.
These three lines, like the preceding stanzas, are separated by an inscribed line
on the tablet.
note that Ishtar is called the queen in line 29 while Ammiditana is introduced as the king (line
41).

Line 3: Adopting the typical Sumerian hymnic style, the opening couplet is repeated
nearly verbatim in lines 3–4. The second stanza (lines 5–8) shows the same literary arti-
fice. The major difference between this line and line 1, of course, is that the deity’s name
( IŠ 8 . DAR = Ištar) replaces the more general word for goddess (iltam).
Ištar zumrā rašubti ilātim
Line 4: Iššum, “woman.” The second line of the couplet is repeated nearly verbatim
but replaces nišī, “people,” with the similar sounding word iššī, “women.”
littaʾʾid bēlit iššī rabīt Igigî
Line 5: Šāt (fs), “she of, that of, which.” Mēleṣum, “excitement, exhilaration, joy.”
Ruʾāmum, “love, sexual charm.” The accusative is adverbial, describing how the goddess
clothes herself. Labāšum, “to clothe oneself, to put on.” Labšat is a 3fs predicative.
šāt mēleṣim ruʾāmam labšat
Line 6: Zaʾānum, “to be adorned.” The G predicative is only used of gods and means
“to be decorated with” (see CDA, 442). Inbum, “fruit, sexual allure.” Mikûm, “seductive
charm.” (The CAD normalizes the word as mēqû and renders it “cosmetics,” see I/J, 20.
Such a rendering is unlikely.) U, “and.” Kuzbum, “attractiveness, sexual appeal.”
zaʾnat inbī mikiam u kuzbam
Line 7: The previous couplet’s first line is repeated, substituting the goddess’s name.
Ištar mēleṣim ruʾāmam labšat
Line 8: Kuzbum is also used to describe both Shamḫat and Gilgamesh in the Epic of
Gilgamesh (see, e.g., I 181, 189 and I 237).
zaʾnat inbī mikiam u kuzbam
Line 9: Šaptān, “lips” (d). Šaptīn is in the oblique case (gen.–acc.) and functions as an
adverbial accusative. Duššupum, “sweetened, very sweet,” is a denominative (D stem) from
dišpum, “honey.” One may wish to use some form of honey in the translation: “honeyed” or
“dripping with honey.” The adj. is used as a 3fs predicative here. Balāṭum, “life, health,
vigor.” Pûm, “mouth.” The line suggests both the allure of the goddess (in that kissing her
would be sweet) as well as her powers to sustain life (in that carbohydrate-loaded honey11410. si-im-ti-iš-ša i-ḫa-an-ni-i-ma ṣi-ḫa-tum

would revive one’s strength). In light of lines 6 and 8, “lips” and “mouth” in this line are
likely to be understood as double entendres.
šaptīn duššupat balāṭum pīša
Line 10: Simtum has a wide semantic range, including “person or thing that is fitting,
suitable, seemly, appropriate, necessary,” “person or thing that befits, does honor to, is the
pride of,” “appurtenances, ornament, characteristic, insigne, proper appearance or behav-
ior or ways, figural representation,” and “face, features” (see CAD S, 278). The latter
meaning is most appropriate here (see CAD S, 283). The form simtišša includes the termi-
native-adverbial ending –iš before the 3fs pronominal suffix, –ša (note also that the result-
ing –šš– does not change to –ss–). The adverbial ending in this construction has a locative
meaning (“in” or “on”). Ṣīḫtum, “smile” (pl. ṣīḫātum). Ḫanāmum, “to thrive, to be luxuriant,
to flourish” (see CDA, 105; AHw, 320). The older CAD Ḫ volume suggests “to bloom” (76),
but this meaning cannot account for the verb’s use with sheep, noted in CDA and AHw.
simtišša iḫannimā ṣīḫātum
Line 11: Šarḫum, “proud, magnificent, splendid” (used as a 3fs predicative). On the
basis of the context, it is likely that the adjective describes Ishtar’s appearance rather than
her internal attitude. I-ri-mu is difficult. The text may be read as irimmu (so CAD I/J, 177
and CDA, 131) and translated “beaded necklace” or the like. Joan and Aage Westenholz
(“Help for Rejected Suitors: The Old Akkadian Love Incantation MAD V 8,” Or n.s. 46
[1977], 198–219, specifically, 205–7) argue that the word “īrimum (or irīmum ?) denotes a
quality, apparently mostly of females, which makes its possessor irresistibly attractive to
the opposite sex” (206). They suggest the word has an abstract meaning in its plural form:
“loveliness, love.” (The singular, they suggest, may be used to designate a personification
of the attribute in the form of a mythological being like the Greek Eros or Roman Cupid
[see 205 and 207]. For further support for the Babylonian Cupid from a new OB love po-
em, see A. R. George, Babylonian Literary Texts in the Schøyen Collection [Cornell University
Studies in Assyriology and Sumerology 10; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2009], 53.) Following the
Westenholzes, Foster translates the word as “love-charms,” but he also recognizes the pos-
sibility that these may take the form of “a necklace or headband” (85, n.1). Ramûm, “to set
in place, to be endowed with.” The form is a 3mp predicative. Rēšum, “head.” The loca-
tive-adverbial ending –um and a 3fs pronominal suffix are attached to the noun, describing
where the beads have been placed. The m of the locative-adverbial ending assimilates to
the š of the pronominal suffix (–mš– becomes –šš–). Notice the consonance in the final
three words of the line.
šarḫat īrimū ramû rēšušša
Line 12: Banûm, “good, beautiful.” Šimtum, “mark, token,” may refer to skin tone; as
it is dual, perhaps it refers to rosy cheeks (CDA, 373). Bitrāmum, “multi-colored.” Īnū,
“eyes.” Šitʾārum, “variegated, iridescent.” The adjectives in this line are 3fp predicatives.

Line 13: Eltum is probably a by-form of iltum, “goddess,” but has also been understood
to mean “pure one” (see Hecker, 722, n.13a). This opening word is an anacoluthon that
establishes the topic of the line, the goddess. Išti, “with.” We expect the suffixed form to be
ištīša but ištaša is attested elsewhere in OB Akkadian (see CAD I/J, 283). The preposition
almost always occurs with a suffix; the one known exception is in our line 45. One could
argue that the preposition is to be understood as ištu, “from, out of,” but the context sug-
gests the line should be about characterizing the goddess herself—what she possesses—
rather than what comes from her. Bašûm, “to be, to exist.” Milkum, “counsel, advice, intel-
ligence,” is the grammatical subject of the sentence.
eltum ištaša ibašši milkum
Line 14: Šīmtum, “what is fixed, fate, destiny.” Šīmāt is a fp construct form.
Mimmāmu/a/i, “everything, all.” Qātum, “hand.” Here again we see the terminative-
adverbial ending followed by a pronominal suffix indicating location. Tamāḫum, “to
grasp.” The form looks like a 3fs predicative, but it is a transitive parsāku (thus the object).
šīmāt mimmāmi qātišša tamḫat
Line 15: Naplāsum, “glance, look” (a noun), bears the locative-adverbial ending (–um)
and a 3fs pronominal suffix. The m of the locative assimilates to the š of the suffix. Bani
may derive from banûm, “to be good” (see CAD B, 91, though translating it with “is creat-
ed (?),” AHw, 102, 135, and Seux, 40; see also the cognate in line 12). But von Soden’s
earlier translation in this line, “ist . . . geschaffen,” “is . . . created,” suggests a derivation
from banûm, “to build, to engender, to create” (likewise Foster’s “is born” [86]). Buʾārum,
“health, prosperity, happiness.” Notice the lack of mimation on the final substantive.
naplāsušša bani buʾāru
Line 16: The list of things engendered by Ishtar’s glance continues. Bāštum (baštum),
“dignity, good looks, pride,” sometimes occurs in contexts with lamassum and šēdum (see
CAD B, 142). Mašraḫū, “good health (?)” (always pl.); CAD M, 385 suggests “splendor,
attractiveness.” The word only occurs twice in extant texts, both times in OB hymns. La-
massum and šēdum were protective spirits that guarded individuals, temples, and cities. See
further Daniel Foxvog, Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and Wolfgang Heimpel, “Lamma/Lamassu.
A.I. Mesopotamien. Philogisch,” RlA 6 (1980–1983), 446–53. For individuals, they are
closely associated with the personal god and goddess (see, e.g., Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, I 43–46).

Line 17: Several obscure words make this line difficult. The first word may be tartāmū
(pl), “mutual love” (CAD T, 245), “love-making” (CDA, 400), “whispers” (see Foster, 86,
citing W. von Soden, review of Marie-Joseph Seux, Hymnes et prières aux dieux de Babylonie
et d’Assyrie. Introduction, traduction et notes, ZA 67 [1977], 279 but see also AHw, 1332).
But it may also be a 3fs form of ramû, tartāmi (see CAD T, 245 and 374, Seux, 40, and von
Soden, 235). There are several verbal forms with a ta– affix in the next several lines that
must be understood as 3fs. Tešmûm, “attention, listening, compliance.” Ritūmum, “in-
tense(?) love, passion” (CAD R, 391), “love-making” (CDA, 306). Ṭūbum, “goodness, hap-
piness, prosperity, good will, peace, contentedness, satisfaction.”
tartāmi tešmê ritūmī ṭūbī
Line 18: Mitgurum is a Gt infinitive used as a substantive, meaning “agreement, gra-
ciousness.” Bêlum, “to rule over, to control, to dispose of.” Given the context of describing
the goddess’s attributes, the verb should be understood as a durative. Šī, “she.” The pres-
ence of the independent pronoun indicates emphasis.
u mitguram tebêl šī-ma
Line 19: Ardatum, “young woman.” The noun is bound to the following verb, which
comprises a short subordinate clause that describes the young woman. Ta-at-ta-ab is prob-
lematic since we expect a subjunctive on the verb. Thureau-Dangin takes ta-at-ta-ab for the
verb tattabû, a 3fs (see also the final verb in the line) perfect from nabûm, “to call, to
name” (see 175, n.9). Others (e.g., von Soden, 236 [implied by translation]) have opted to
read the signs as ta-at-ta-du ! , presumably understanding the form as an N 3fs perfect
(tattaddû) from nadûm, “to throw down,” here “to abandon.” See Seux, 40, n.9 for a brief
discussion and his preference for the former verb. Neither option is without problems.
Ummum, “mother.” Notice the loss of mimation. Rašûm, “to acquire, to obtain.” Tarašši is a
3fs durative.
ardat tattabû/tattaddû umma tarašši
Line 20: Zakārum, “to say, to speak, to invoke.” I-ni-ši may be a sandhi writing for ina
iššī, “among the women” (iniššī) or “ina nišī, “among the people” (innišī). See lines 2 and 4,
Seux, 40, n.10, and Foster, 88 at the note for line 20. For nabûm, see the note on line 19.
Šumum, “name.” Invoking or calling on the name of a deity was a means of honoring them.
izakkarši iniššī/innišī inabbi šumša
Line 21: Ayyum (see CAD ajû), “who?, which?” Narbium, “greatness.” The š on the
noun is an apocopated 3fs pronominal suffix (narbiam + ša > narbiašša > narbiaš). The
initial sound of the following verb may have contributed to the loss of the suffix’s a.𒐼 A N OB R OYAL H YMN TO I SHTAR

Šanānum, “to rival, to equal.” Mannum, “who?” The line contains two question words, thus
two questions.

Line 22: Gašrum, “powerful, mighty.” Ṣīrum, “exalted, supreme, splendid.” Šūpûm,
“manifest, resplendent, brillliant.” All of the adjs. are mp predicatives. Parṣū, “cultic ordi-
nances, rites.”
gašrū ṣīrū šūpû parṣūša
Line 23: The poem returns to the Sumerian hymnic style used in the opening two
stanzas of the hymn. Ishtar’s name here, however, does not replace a pronoun in line 21
that refers to her. Rather, the initial interrogative pronoun there (ayyum) is removed and
the inserted divine name here in line 23 functions as an anacoluthon, similar to the use of
eltum at the opening of line 13.
Ištar narbiaš išannan mannum
Line 24: This line repeats line 22 verbatim.
gašrū ṣīrū šūpû parṣūša
Line 25: The initial signs on the tablet are bi-a-at; the present reading comes from von
Soden (see Foster, 86 at the note on line 25 and Seux, 40, n.11). Šāt, see line 5. Again, the
presence of the independent pronoun here is emphatic (and redundant with the pronomi-
nal suffix on nazzāzuš). Atārum, “to exceed in number or size, to surpass in importance,
quality.” The form atar is 3ms predicative. I-ni-li is probably a sandhi writing for ina ilī,
“among the gods” (see similarly line 20). Nanzāzum (nanzazum, nazzāzum), “attendant,
courtier; position, station.” The latter meaning is most appropriate here.
šāt inilī atar nazzāzuš
Line 26: Kabātum, “to be(come) heavy, important, respected.” Amātum, “word, mat-
ter.” Notice we have the later form of the word rather than awātum; the former does occa-
sionally occur in OB Akkadian contexts. The addition of the 3fs pronominal suffix, –ša,
directly to the base of the noun, amāt–, results in the sound change: –tš– becomes –ss–. El,
“on, above, beyond,” is a by-form of the more common preposition eli. It is unclear wheth-
er the pronominal suffix attached to the preposition refers to the gods’ words (“over
them,” i.e., their words) or to the gods themselves (“over them,” i.e., the gods). Regarding
ḫa-AB-ta-at-ma, the middle radical of the root from which the final verb derives is disput-
ed; thus, the AB sign is in Roman capital letters. CAD Ḫ derives the verb from ḫabātum118

three lexica agree that the verb means “to prevail, to triumph.”

Line 28: The goddess’s position and the effectiveness of her word are inextricably
linked.
kabtat amāssa elšunu ḫabtat-ma
Line 29: Šarratum, “queen.” The form šarrassun is a 3fs predicative with a shortened
3mp pronominal suffix, –šun(u), attached to it. Šutadunnum (Št lex. of nadānum), “to delib-
erate, to discuss something (with others).” The form is a 3mp durative. Siqrum is a by-form
of zikrum, “utterance, speech, command.” See GAG §30c for the occurrence of s for an
expected z.
šarrassun uštanaddanū siqrīša
Line 30: Kullatum, “all of, totality.” Šâš is an OB poetic form of the dative pronoun
šâšim, “to her.” Kamāsum, “to kneel, to crouch.” The 3fs dative suffix (without the final m)
on the predicative is redundant with šâš earlier in the line.
kullassun šâš kamsūši
Line 31: Nannārum (nannarum), “luminary, light of the sky, moon.” This is a common
epithet of the moon god Sin and occasionally for Ishtar. Thureau-Dangin reads the final
verb as i-la-qú-ši-im, deriving it from leqûm, “to receive.” Others have suggested the present
reading, which derives the verb from alākum, “to go.” See Foster, 88 at the note for line 31
for references.
nannārīša illakūšim
Line 32: Iššū, “women.” Awīlum, “man, human being.” In light of the first plural noun,
the singular one that follows is probably either a mistake or functioning as a collective.
Palāḫum, “to fear.” Given the fact that there is an object on the verb, we should under-
stand the form as a transitive parsāku construction.

Line 33: Puḫrum, “assembly.” The noun also bears the terminative-adverbial ending
(–iš) and a shortened 3mp pronominal suffix. This assembly is the divine council. The sub-
stantive etellum can have a nominal sense, “lord, prince,” as well as an adjectival one, “pre-
eminent,” as here. Šūturum, “supreme, surpassing.” Both adjectives in the line are predica-
tives. Ishtar’s word is authoritative, which is partly due to her position (line 34) but also a
product of her insight (see line 35).
puḫriššun etel qabûša šūtur
Line 34: Ana, “to, for.” An-nim is for Anim, the genitive of Anum. Anu(m) is the Meso-
potamian sky god (see page 217). Šarrum, “king.” Malâm, “as an equal,” only occurs here
and in the Agushaya Poem. (W)ašābum, “to sit, to dwell.” The form of the verb is a 3fs
predicative. The accusative pronominal suffix is not a direct object; rather, it is an adver-
bial accusative describing the goddess’s sitting. She sits “with them” or “among them,” i.e.,
with/among the other gods.
ana Anim šarrīšunu malâm ašbassunu
Line 35: Uznum, literally “ear” but also “understanding.” Nēmequm, “knowledge, wis-
dom, experience.” We expect an accusative rather than a genitive case ending. Ḫasīsum,
“ear, hearing, wisdom, comprehension.” All three words modify eršet adverbially. Eršu,
“wise,” is used as a 3fs predicative. Line 33 asserted the authority of Ishtar’s word. Here
we see a reason for that authority: she speaks with wisdom.
uznam nēmeqim ḫasīsam eršet
Line 36: Mitlukum (Gt of malākum), “to confer (about something), to discuss (with
others).” Ḫammum, “master, head of household, head of family.” Ishtar’s ḫammum is cer-
tainly Anu. The line states the conclusion for which the previous lines of the stanza have
prepared.
imtallikū šī u ḫammuš
Line 37: Ramûm is the same word as in line 11, but here it means “to take up resi-
dence, to occupy.” For other occurrences with parakkum, see CAD R, 134. Ištīniš (ištēniš),
“together.” Parakkum, “cult, dais, sanctuary.” Again we see Ishtar described as equal in
rank to Anu.

Line 38: Iggegunnîm is the result of ina plus gegu(n)nûm (gigunû), “raised temple.”
Gegunnûm is some kind of “sacred building erected on terraces” (CAD G, 67). The word
sometimes occurs in apposition to ziqqurratum, “ziggurrat, temple step-tower,” and may
refer “to the sanctuary on top of the temple tower” (CAD G, 70). Šubtum, “dwelling, seat.”
Rīštum, “joy, exultation, jubilation.” Rīšātim is a plural.
iggegunnîm šubat rīšātim
Line 39: Muttiš, “in front of, before.” Ilu, “god, deity.” Nazuzzū is a 3mp predicative
from nazzazum (N of i/uzuzzu; see GAG §107e), “to appear, to become present.” The i in
the third sign of the verb’s orthography is superfluous. This line provides another aspect of
Ishtar’s authority: the gods appear before her (and Anu) as servants.
muttiššun ilū nazuzzū
Line 40: Ipšum means “deed, action.” But bound to pûm, “mouth,” ipiš pî means
“speech, command” (see CAD I/J, 170). The form of the word here, ipšiš, is to be explained
as ipšu plus the terminative-adverbial ending, which has replaced the preposition ana.
Bašûm means “to be, to be available” but with ears and eyes, “to be fixed on, to be atten-
tive.” Uznāšun is the nom. dual of uznum with an apocopated 3mp pronominal suffix. The
servile status of the other gods, intimated in the previous line, is confirmed and described
here.
ipšiš pīšunu bašiā uznāšun
Line 41: This line subtly introduces Ammiditana (see line 43), the OB king who is
lauded here as the beneficiary of Ishtar’s largess. Migrum can mean “consent, approval,
agreement” but also “favored one, favorite” (see CAD M/2, 48), as is appropriate here.
Narāmum, “beloved.” Libbum, “heart.” This line only introduces the subject of the sentence,
which is completed in the next line.
šarrum migrašun narām libbīšun
Line 42: Šarḫiš, “proudly, splendidly, in a lavish manner.” Itaqqû, (Gtn of naqû), “to
offer a libation, sacrifice repeatedly.” The form of the verb is durative, though one might
expect ittanaqqi. The present form may be explained by the fact that the Gtn stem of I-n
and I-w verbs sometimes elide the –ta– (see GAG §91d and §102k). The pronominal suffix
is a 3mp accusative, though a dative, –šunūšim, is expected. As is often the case in this text,
the final short vowel has dropped off. Nīqum, “offering, sacrifice.” Ellum, “pure, holy.”

namrāʾī in line 44. Note Foster’s conflated translation: “His personal, pure libation of cattle
and fatted stags” (87). Both phrases are the direct object of the verb in line 44.

Šubbûm (D of šebûm), “to fill with, to satisfy with (= acc.).” Lûm (līʾum), “bull.” Yalum

out this stanza, with both a ventive (–am) and a 3ms dative (–šum) suffix on the end. The
object of the verb is contained in the following line. Other traditions make Ishtar the

bow down, submit.” The 3fs verb ends with both a ventive and a 3ms dative pronominal
suffix. The verb’s object occurs in the following line.
siqrušša tušaknišaššum
Line 50: Kibrum, “edge, bank, shore, rim.” The plural form of the word bound to the
word erbûm, “four,” means “the whole world, all the lands” (kibrāt erbêm). Šēpum, “foot.”
kibrāt erbêm ana šēpīšu
Line 51: Napḫarum, “total, all, the whole.” Kalûm, “all, totality. Dadmū, “inhabited
world, villages, settlements.”
u napḫar kalīšunu dadmī
Line 52: Ṣamādum, “to yoke, to tie up.” The form is a 3fs perfect with a 3mp accusa-
tive pronominal suffix, which is redundant with the object expressed already in the previ-
ous line. The t of the perfect infix assimilates to the sibilant first root letter (–ṣt– become
–ṣṣ–). Also, the –dš– cluster at the boundary of the verb and suffix becomes –ss–. Nīru,
“yoke.” Ana + nīru + 3ms pronominal suffix –šu results in anīrīšu. With regard to the last
two signs in the line, see lines 39 and 54 for a similar orthography.
taṣṣamissunūti anīrīšu
Line 53: Biblum means “the (action of) bringing, things brought.” But the phrase bibil
(bibel) libbim means “heart’s desire.” Zamārum, “song.” Lalûm, “exuberance, desire, (sexual)
charms.” CAD L, 50 translates zamār lalêša as “her favorite song.”
bibel libbīša zamār lalêša
Line 54: Naṭûm, “suitable, fitting.” The word describes the phrases in the previous
line. The “his” of ana pīšu is probably king Ammiditana. Ea is the god of wisdom, magic,
and water (see page 227). Epēšum, “to do, to make,” but with an object in the semantic
domain of speech or speaking (here, siqrum), “to speak.” Īpussi is the 3cs preterite plus a
3fs dative pronominal suffix (–šim). The subject is the king.
naṭûm-ma ana pīšu siqri Ea īpussi
Line 55: Šemûm, “to hear.” The verb is 3cs; Ea is the subject. Tanittum, “praise.”
Riāšum, “to rejoice, to exult in, to exult over.” Irīš is a 3cs preterite with a 3ms pronominal
suffix. The verbal action is sequential.

Line 56: This line seems to provide the content of Ea’s exultation. Balāṭum, “to live, to
be healthy.” The form is a 3cs precative (as is the other verb in the line). The king is the
beneficiary of the well-wishing, that is, he is the grammatical subject. Šarrašu, “his king,”
the subject of the second precative, refers to the king’s king, perhaps the city god. But it is
unclear. See Thureau-Dangin, 177, n.3 (also Foster, 87, n.2). Râmum, “to love.” Addāriš is
ana plus dāriš, “forever.”
libluṭ-ma šarrašu lirāmšu addāriš
Line 57: Lines 57–59 are the antiphonal refrain. Rāʾimīki is a G ms participle from
râmum (see line 56) with a 2fs pronominal suffix. The participle modifies šarri. Note, also,
the loss of mimation in šarri. Just as Ea requested that his king love Ammiditana (line 56),
he characterizes Ammiditana as one who loves the goddess.
Ištar ana Ammiditana šarri rāʾimīki
Line 58: For arkam dāriam balāṭam, the object of the (fs) imperative, see line 46.
Šarākum, “to grant, to bestow.” The line repeats sentiments expressed already in lines 46
and 47.
arkam dāriam balāṭam šurkī
Line 59: See line 56 for the verb. Wishing the king long life was not only a means to
show loyalty to the king, it might also be in the best interest of the wisher. The transition
from one king to another could be marred by civil unrest and/or military action.

Line 60: This line is composed in Sumerian, which translates into Akkadian as
miḫiršu. It means “its antiphonal.” The term is found in several OB hymnic compositions.
See CAD M/2, 57 (miḫru).
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Although there are several hymns in the Hebrew Bible to Yahweh (e.g., Pss
8, 29, Nah 1:2–8, etc.), 1 there are no hymns to goddesses. Perhaps the closest
candidate of such is the self-description of the female personified Wisdom in
1
See Hermann Gunkel and Joachim Begrich, Introduction to the Psalms: The Genres of the Reli-
gious Lyrics of Israel (trans. James D. Nogalski; Macon: Mercer University Press, 1998), 22–23 for
a rather full listing of hymns and “hymn-like elements” in the Hebrew Bible.124Prov 8:4–36. 2 But only a small minority of scholars believes Wisdom has the
attributes here of a full-fledged, independent goddess. 3 The so very obvious ab-
sence of licit (or sanctioned) goddess worship in the Hebrew Bible is one of the
Bible’s most distinctive features as compared to other ancient Near Eastern reli-
gious texts. 4
On a smaller scale, several phrases in our hymn merit comparative atten-
tion. In line 9 Ishtar is enticingly described as having lips dripping with honey.
The same sensual idea is found in Song 4:11, where the female lover is described
as follows: ‫ְך‬ ֵ‫שׁוֹנ‬ ְ‫ל‬ ‫ת‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ‫שׁ‬ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫דּ‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ‫לּ‬ ָ ‫כּ‬ ַ ‫ך‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫תוֹת‬
‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׂ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ְ ‫טּ‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֶ ‫נ‬ , “your lips drip pure honey,
honey and milk (lie) under your tongue.” 5 It seems rather clear that in both cas-
es honey functions as a sensual metaphor for the desirability of kissing feminine
lips. 6 Yet the juxtaposition of the phrase in line 9a of our hymn with the state-
ment in line 9b, namely, “her mouth (is) vivacity” (balāṭum, lit. “life”), suggests
that honey is more than an ancient flavored lip gloss in the hymn. Honey is also
life-sustaining; its sweetness invigorates. The same idea is expressed literally in 1
Sam 14:24–30, the account of Jonathan disobeying his father’s oath by eating
some honey found in the field, and used metaphorically in Prov 24:13–14,
where the desirability of eating honey is used to impress upon young boys (note
‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫בּ‬,
“my son” in v. 13) the desirability of obtaining wisdom. For with wisdom, so
the proverb goes, ‫ת‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫לֹא‬ ‫ָך‬ ‫ת‬ ְ ָ‫ו‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ‫ת‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ית‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ח‬ ֲ ‫א‬ ַ ‫יֵשׁ‬ , “there is a future, and your hope will
not be cut off” (v. 14).
The incomparability of the goddess trope that we see in lines 21 and 23
compares to similar hymnic expressions used of Yahweh. 7 For example, in the
celebrated Song of the Sea Miriam exclaims ‫שׁ‬ ‫ֹד‬ ֶ ‫קּ‬ ‫בּ‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫דּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ְ ֶ‫נ‬ ‫ה‬ ‫ֹכ‬ ָ ‫מ‬ ‫כּ‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ‫ֹכ‬ ָ ‫מ‬ ‫כ‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ִ
‫א‬ ֶ‫ל‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ‫ה‬ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ‫ֹּלת‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ‫נוֹר‬,
“Who is like you, O Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like
you, glorious in holiness? 8 Awesome in splendor, working wonders!” David and
Solomon, both kings like Ammiditana, laud Yahweh similarly with statements in
2 Sam 7:22 ( 1 Chron 17:20): ‫ָך‬ ‫ת‬ ֶ ‫זוּל‬
‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ין‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ְ‫ו‬ ‫מוָֹך‬ ‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ין‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ָ‫ֹנ‬ ‫ד‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫גּ‬, ָ “you are

Compare the first person self-praise here with the same in the Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi (see
W. G. Lambert, “The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi,” Or n.s. 36 [1967], 105–32, with plates VII–
XXIII for the most recent edition of the text). See also n.234 on page 59 of the general introduc-
tion for other references to the self-praise of deities.

It should be noted that the most common word for honey in BH, ‫שׁ‬ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫דּ‬, ְ is cognate to Akk. dišpu,
despite the metathesis of the final two consonants. See Tawil, ALCBH, 72.
6
Honey, of course, is not limited to sensual metaphors. The sweetness of honey is used in Ezek
3:3 to describe the literal taste of the divine scroll Ezekiel ate and in Ps 119:103 as the basis of
comparison to convey the surpassing sweetness of Yahweh’s word.

great, O lord Yahweh, for there in no one like you, and there is no god except
you!” and 1 Kgs 8:23 ( 2 Chron 6:14): ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫מּ‬ ַ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫בּ‬ ַ ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬

‫ע‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬, “O Yahweh, god of Israel, there is no one like you among the
gods in the heavens above and upon the earth below. . . .” (It is notable that
both royal hymnic statements occur in the context of petitionary prayer.) See
also, for example, Pss 35:10, 71:19, 86:8, Jer 10:6–7, and Mic 7:18. Interesting-
ly, the incomparability of Yahweh—especially as compared to Mesopotamian
gods—is a major theme in Second Isaiah, where, although humans do laud this
divine attribute (see, e.g., 40:18), it is the deity himself who proclaims it most
ardently (see, e.g., 40:25, 44:7, 45:21, and 46:5).
Lines 25–40 of our hymn describe Ishtar’s position in the divine assembly.
Since I present a brief comparative discussion of the divine assembly elsewhere
in this volume (see Sin 1 on page 398), I focus here on one particular aspect that
indicates a common representation in Israel and Mesopotamia of the hierarchy
within it. In line 39 the hymn states that the gods appear before Ishtar and Anu,
indicating thereby (and throughout the context) the pre-eminent position of the
divine couple in relation to all of the other deities under their command (see
lines 26, 28, and 40). The Akk. word translated as “appear” in line 39 is an N
stem verb with an ingressive sense, derived from i/uzuzzu, “to stand.” This
standing posture of the gods is in direct opposition to Ishtar’s being seated, de-
scribed in line 34. The very same notion of divine beings making an appearance
or presenting themselves to a divine king occurs in the Hebrew Bible at Job 1:6
and 2:1, where we read: ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ל־י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫צּ‬ ֵ ַ‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫אוּ‬ ‫בוֹ‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ , “the gods entered (the
divine court) to present themselves to Yahweh.” Notice the use of the hitpael
stem of ‫יצב‬, a by-form of ‫נצב‬, “to stand.” In fact, verbs of standing (especially
‫)עמד‬ are commonly used in BH to describe the posture of subordinates serving a
superior, sometimes depicted as seated. A number of examples of servants stand-
ing before their human master could be cited, 9 but the most relevant text for
understanding the divine assembly is 1 Kgs 22:19 ( 2 Chron 18:18), where Mi-
caiah describes Yahweh’s throne room: ‫ד‬ ‫ֹמ‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫ל־צ‬
‫כ‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ‫אוֹ‬ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ל־כּ‬
‫ע‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫ית‬ ִ ‫א‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ
‫מֹאלוֹ‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ְ ‫וּמ‬
‫ינוֹ‬ ‫ימ‬
‫מ‬ ִ ‫יו‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫ע‬,
“I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne and the entire host of
heaven was standing before him, on his right and on his left.” The court discuss-
es for a moment how to entrap Ahab in battle. And then in v. 21 ( 2 Chron
18:20) a particular servant steps out from the throng to proffer the winning idea:
‫נּוּ‬ ‫תּ‬ ֶ ‫פ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫ר‬ ‫אמ‬
‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫מֹד‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ַ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫רוּח‬
‫ה‬ ָ ‫א‬ ‫צ‬ ֵ ֵ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬, “the spirit came forward, stood before
Yahweh, and said, ‘I will deceive him.’” Isa 6:1–2 presents the very same image
of a seated Yahweh with divine servants standing in attendance. As many others
have demonstrated, 10 the divine assembly is a common mythological idea
throughout the ancient Near East based on the royal court. It is this common
human model that explains the mythological commonalities in the texts.

An Incantation-Prayer: Ghosts of My Family 1
A LAN L ENZI
G HOSTS :
Ancient Mesopotamians believed ghosts were the animating force in human
bodies that (usually) continued to exist in the grave/netherworld or elsewhere
after physical death. A proper burial, i.e., interment, was necessary for a per-
son’s ghost to take up its new and proper residence in the grave/netherworld.
Without this social dignity, they might be condemned to roam as a restless
ghost—though there were other reasons a person became a restless ghost after
death. 1 Once the deceased was laid to rest, a cyclical ritual called kispu(m) had
to be performed by a surviving relative (usually). This person was known as the
pāqidu, “the one who attends to (it).” This rite included making funerary offer-
ings of various kinds of food (kispa kasāpu), pouring out libations of water (mê
naqû), and invoking the deceased’s name as a memorial (šuma zakāru). The per-
formance of this rite was necessary to maintain the deceased’s ghost in the neth-
erworld. Without it, the ghost would have a miserable existence and could turn
malevolent against humans. This rite did not, however, have to continue indefi-
nitely. Rather, after a generation or two—after those who had known the de-
ceased were themselves dead—a ghost would become part of the collective dead
and no longer receive offerings as an individual.
Ghosts were believed to have supra-human powers, somewhat like demons.
They could act benevolently toward humans—thus the appeal in our prayer, but
we have relatively few texts that seek their assistance. 2 In some of these, the
ghosts are asked to assist the supplicant with the removal of a certain evil by
handing it over to specific denizens of the netherworld (as in our prayer). In
others, we see the practice of necromancy, divination via the dead (see Finkel).
Usually, however, ghosts were considered malevolent, bringing illness and other

See Scurlock, “Ghosts and the Afterlife,” 1890 for a list of reasons people became ghosts. Anni-
hilation seems to have been the fate of those who were burned to death (see the final lines of
Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld).

formed by exorcists (āšipus) to treat these ghost-induced maladies. 3
T HE P RAYER :
This incantation-prayer is embedded in a larger anti-witchcraft ritual that
contains several other incantation-prayers. 4 The incantation-prayers that precede
ours address various netherworld-related beings, such as the Divine River
(Nāru), the Anunnakki, Shamash, and Gilgamesh, the latter two of which func-
tion as netherworld judges (see our line 7). The incantation-prayer that follows
ours is addressed to the ghost of nobody (eṭem lā mammanama), represented by a
skull (gulgullu). 5 A very close parallel to our incantation-prayer appears in an
incantation-prayer to Ishtar and Dumuzi. 6 This illustrates how incantation-
prayers were adopted into and adapted to different ritual contexts (see Farber,
118).
The text of the prayer may be divided thematically into the three typical
parts of an incantation-prayer: the invocation (lines 1–4a), the petition (lines
4b–15, 17a), and the promise of praise (lines 16, 17b); but these parts are
grammatically integrated into one another. That is, the first element in the peti-
tion section of the prayer (line 4b) completes the sentence begun in the invoca-
tion, and the two elements comprising the promise of praise are each dependent
upon one of the last two petitions in the prayer: line 16 depends on line 15 and
line 17b upon line 17a. Given this, the prayer’s brevity, and the fact that it lacks
the various transitional phrases one often sees in, for example, the shuilla-
prayers—transitions such as the self-presentation formula or the reiterated invo-
cation, the prayer reads very quickly and smoothly. Perhaps the one feature in
the text of the prayer that creates a sense of disjunction between or transition
from one conceptual part to another is the use of first person verbal forms in
lines 4b–6, which moves the prayer from invocation to petition, 7 and the return
of these first person verbs starting in line 14, which moves the prayer from a
predominance of petition to the lines containing its promise of praise.
The invocation differs from many of the other prayers in this volume in that
it does not extensively laud the beings invoked. The ghosts are not reminded of
their attributes or cosmic position via a string of epithets at the beginning of this
prayer. Rather, the invocation simply identifies—in multiple ways—to whom the
prayer is directed: any and all family ghosts. I have suggested elsewhere that the

The disjunction created by the first person verbs in lines 4b–6 is heightened by the initial 2mp
independent pronoun (attunu) and the anacoluthon that follows in the invocation.

dingirshadibba-prayers have very brief invocations because the personal god
addressed in those prayers, unlike the high gods entreated in the shuilla-prayers,
is familiar with the supplicant and already has a close personal relationship with
him. One need not heap honorifics upon a deity one already knows well; but a
god near the top of the divine hierarchy would have to be addressed with all due
respect. 8 The same reasoning for the brief invocation of the present prayer
would seem to apply here as well.
The invocation moves seamlessly into the petition section of the prayer. The
first part of this section describes the supplicant’s preparatory actions (lines 4b–
6) via a series of first person preterite verbs. Three petitions to establish the
ghosts’ presence begin the petitions proper (lines 7–8). These are followed by a
series of petitions in lines 9–15 and 17a that concern the supplicant’s affliction
and recovery.
Interlaced with the final two petitions of the prayer is the promise of praise
(lines 16, 17b). The first promise, to libate cool water down the grave pipe, is
specific to the ghostly audience of the prayer. The second is a stock phrase, ap-
parently added to our prayer mechanically (with a 2ms pronominal suffix rather
than the expected 2mp).

Line 1: One of the witnesses to the prayer, LKA 89, preserves traces of the word ÉN =
šiptu, “ritual wording, incantation,” which indicates to the user of the tablet that a prayer
or incantation follows. GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost of a dead person.” Given the 2mp pronoun
attunu, “you,” at the head of the line in apposition to the vocative eṭemmu, the latter is
certainly to be rendered as a collective, thus “ghosts.” Notice also the consonance between
attunu and eṭem (the bound form of eṭemmu). Kimtu, “family.” One might consider render-
ing eṭem kimtīya as “my ancestral family” (see Abusch, “Etemmu,” 309). Bānû, literally
“builder,” but in the context of kinship is better rendered “begetter, progenitor” (also col-
lective). Qabru, “grave.” If the restoration at the end of the line is correct, the case ending
should be understood as an adverbial accusative of place. Line 1 begins a long anacolu-
thon, recognized as such only after the appearance of the words kispa aksipkunūši in line 4.
attunu eṭem kimtīya bānû qabra
Line 2: AD = abu, “father.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix, “my.” AMA = ummu, “moth-
er.” ŠEŠ = aḫu, “brother.” NIN = aḫātu, “sister.” Specific relatives are listed, thereby fur-
ther defining the ghosts addressed by the prayer. We should probably assume that the
bound form of the word for ghost, eṭem, has been elided from the head of the line but in
fact governs all of the nouns. The nouns should therefore be taken as genitives (see the
next line, where the oblique case form of the 1cs pronominal suffix is explicitly indicated).
The repetition of abi and ummi, the similar sounding aḫi and aḫāti, and the six instances of
the oblique 1cs pronominal suffix give the line a sing-song sound.
(eṭem) abīya abi abīya ummīya ummi ummīya aḫīya aḫātīya
Line 3: Nišūtu, “kin, relatives.” Salātu, “family, clan.” Again, eṭem has been elided
from the head of the line but governs the nouns in the genitive. The prayer reverts back to
collective kinship terms to designate the ghosts addressed. Notice how the 1cs pronominal
suffixes on each feminine noun affect the phonological rhythm of the line.

Line 4: Mala, “as much as, as many as.” Mala is an all-inclusive term, used to make
sure no dead relative is left out (and thereby, in this case, offended). KI = erṣetu, “earth.”
In a context that deals with the dead, however, erṣetu must mean “netherworld.” Although
Akkadian lost mimation (final m) in the late OB period, some scholars prefer to read the
phonetic complement that follows KI in our text as –tim, seeing in it a kind of frozen tradi-
tional orthography. Others prefer to indicate the loss of mimation explicitly by reading the
same sign as –tì. This is generalizable so that some will read a final TUM, e.g., as tu 4 while
others will read it as tum. Regardless of the convention one adopts, the meaning of the
word is not affected. Ṣalālu, “to sleep.” Sleeping is, of course, a very common way of
speaking about the state of the dead. In keeping with the plurality of address in the invo-
cation, the predicative ṣallū is 3mp. Kispa kasāpu, “to offer a funerary offering” (cognate
accusative). The preceding kinship nouns, which constitute a long anacoluthon, are the
referents of the dative pronominal suffix, –kunūši, “to you” (mp), on the verb here and on
the next four verbs in lines 5 and 6. This suffix brings the text back conceptually to attunu
in line 1. The 1cs verbs here and in lines 5 and 6 introduce the supplicant and describe the
supplicant’s ritual actions. These actions, in tandem with the verbal invocation, attempt to
get the ghosts’ attention.
mala ina erṣeti ṣallū kispa aksipkunūši
Line 5: A . MEŠ = mû, “water.” Naqû, “to pour out (a libation), sacrifice.” An actual
libation would probably have accompanied this prayer. Liquids that were libated in ritual
contexts included water, beer, wine, oil, honey, and milk among others. Only ghosts are
offered water (see Mayer, UFBG, 152). Kunnû, “to treat kindly, to honor,” and the two
verbs in the following line are speech-acts (or performatives), the speaking of which exe-
cute their ritual action (i.e., “I hereby honor you”). All three verbs, which do not seem to
refer to distinct physical acts, probably further define the intention of the libation: the
supplicant is preparing the deity to pay attention to the supplicant’s petitions. Both naqû
and kunnû are commonly found in rituals honoring a superior, which includes deities and
other non-obvious beings like dead ancestors (see CAD N/1, 337–38 and K, 541–42). No-
tice how consonance and assonance abounds in this line and the next. Though the repeat-
ed 2mp pronominal suffix adds to these phonological features, they are not limited to
such. For example, both verbs are from weak roots containing an unvoiced velar consonant
and an i theme-vowel. Also, the supplied object for the first verb, while balancing out the
longer form of the second verb and thereby creating a symmetrical line in terms of sylla-
bles, also provides a nasal consonant (m) that resonates well with the n in the second verb.
mê aqqīkunūši ukannīkunūši
Line 6: Šurruḫu (D of šarāḫu), “to glorify, to give praise, to make splendid.” Kubbutu
(D of kabātu), “to treat with honor, respect.” These two verbs are also frequently found in
ritual contexts honoring a superior. For other contexts that use both verbs together, see138UD -mi

Line 7: UD = ūmu, “day.” Ina ūmi annî, literally, “on this day,” should be translated

imperative can be translated as “here.” Line 7 contains the supplicant’s first petition: they
are invoking their ancestors in this prayer in order for the ancestors to stand on the suppli-
cant’s behalf before two important judicial deities of the netherworld, Shamash and Gil-
gamesh.

Line 8: Dânu, “to judge.” Dīnī, “my case.” EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision, verdict.” KUD
= parāsu, literally, “to cut, to divide,” but in this legal context “to decide.” These two
verbs frequently occur together (see CAD P, 530–32 for some examples). This line contin-
ues the supplicant’s petition.
dīnī dinā purussāya pursā
Line 9: NÍG ḪUL = mimma lemnu, “everything evil.” Rather than list all the suspected
problems, the supplicant uses the most general terms possible. Besides ensuring coverage
of the supplicant’s own problem, this manner of speaking would also make the prayer
suitable for any number of other people suffering from a wide variety of maladies. SU =
zumru, “body.” UZU . MEŠ = šīrū, “flesh.” The plural form does not change the meaning.
SA . MEŠ = šerʾānū, “sinews, veins, tendons, muscles.” GÁL = bašû, “to exist, to be.” The
form of the verb is probably a 3ms predicative (baši) plus subjunctive –u (but there are no
syllabic spellings in the MSS to confirm this). Line 9 forms the object of the verb in line 10.
mimma lemnu ša ina zumrīya šīrīya šerʾānīya bašû
Line 10: ŠU = qātu, “hand,” though a metaphorical rendering may be more appropri-
ate: “power,” “charge,” or “responsibility.” d NAM . TAR = Namtar, a netherworld deity,
whose name means “fate.” SUKKAL = šukkallu (sukkallu), “a court official, minister, counse-
lor,” is in apposition to Namtar. Šukkallu is an epithet for many gods, although the noun
that this term governs is typically a divine name (e.g., Ninshubur, šukallu of Anu; see CAD
S, 358–59 for other examples). Here the word specifies Namtar’s position in the nether-
world (erṣeti). Paqādu + ana, “to entrust, to hand over something to someone.” The sup-
plicant makes yet another petition of the ancestral ghosts, but this is the first one that
specifies their personal problem. They ask the ghosts to give the malady with which they𒐊 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G HOSTS OF M Y F AMILY 1

Line 11: d NIN . GIŠ . ZI . DA = Ningizzida, another netherworld deity. GU . ZA . LÁ = guzalû ,
literally, “throne-bearer.” Like šukkallu, this word is an epithet for deities and demons and
specifies Ningizzida’s position in the netherworld. DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “wide,”
a common modifier of erṣeti when used of the netherworld (see CAD R, 162). EN . NUN =
maṣṣartu, “watch, guard, observation, security.” Dunnunu (D of danānu), literally, “to make
strong, to reinforce,” but with maṣṣarta as the object, the verb means “to watch strictly,
carefully” (see CAD M/1, 335). The 3mp pronominal suffix on the noun becomes the direct
object of the verb in idiomatic English. The imperatives have given way to a precative in
this line. This change is simply due to the fact that the agent of the verb, Ningizzida, is not
being addressed by the speaker directly in this petition; an imperative would be inappro-
priate.
Ningizzida guzalê erṣeti rapašti maṣṣartašunu lidannin
Line 12: d BÍ . DU 8 = Bidu, a netherworld deity. There is some dispute about the proper
reading of this god’s name. Some read the name as Nedu. Ì . DU 8 . GAL = idugallu, “chief gate-
keeper.” The meaning of this word is generally agreed upon, but the proper reading of the
logogram and the precise Akkadian equivalent is unclear. (Compare Andrew George, “Sev-
en Words,” NABU 1991, #19 [followed here], CDA, 125, s.v. idugallu, the entries of the
related term atû in both CAD A/2, 516–18 [note the reference to atūgallu on p. 518] and
CDA, 31, and finally AEAD, 28, s.v. etūgallu. I thank Bob Whiting for providing a number
of references with regard to this word.) Given the mention of a third party, Bidu, at the
head of the line, we expect a precative main verb in this line, as in line 11, to continue the
supplicant’s petitions. Scurlock (352) suggests līdil, “let him shut,” from edēlu, “to shut, to
bolt.” An unpublished witness to this prayer replaces pānīšunu with EGIR -šú-[nu], arḫīšunu,
“behind them” (see Scurlock, 352). Locking a gate behind someone makes sense if the
guard is on the exterior side of the gate. (For example, after a person exits a restricted
room, the guard in the hallway makes sure the door is locked behind them.) In Bidu’s case,
he is on the interior of the netherworld, the place where the supplicant wants his affliction
to go. Bidu guards the gate so no one can get out. It makes sense, therefore, to wish Bidu to
lock the gate in front of a recent arrival to the netherworld. Upon passing through the
entrance to the netherworld, a person might wish to turn around and leave. But Bidu will
not allow it; he locks the gate in front of them.
Bidu idugal erṣeti pānīšunu līdil
Line 13: DAB . MEŠ = Ṣubbutu (D of ṣabātu), “to seize.” The verb should be understood
as an imperative to match the following one. Šūrudu (Š of [w]arādu), “to cause to go
down.” (The sign that comprises the first syllable of the verb is unclear on the tablet, but a
ŠU sign fits the traces.) The prayer reverts to imperatives in its continuation of the petition140

section. Oddly, the pronominal suffixes on the verbs are both 3ms despite the fact that all
the previous suffixes are 3mp (but note line 9’s mimma lemnu). Although corruption in the
transmission of the prayer is not out of the question (i.e., the NU sign dropped off the 3mp
suffix –šunu, twice!), this explanation seems unlikely. Perhaps the supplicant assumes the
problem (singular) has been identified at this point in the prayer (?). KUR . NU . GI 4 . A =
Kurnugi, literally, “the land of no return” (māt lā târi), “netherworld.” Notice the preposi-
tional phrase occurs at the end of the line. This is not typical syntax (compare lines 7 and
10). This position may be explained in light of the double imperative: the text intends to
align the actions of the two verbs closely, and since the location given in the prepositional
phrase only makes sense in terms of the second verb, the prepositional phrase follows it.
ṣubbitāšū-ma šūridāšu ana Kurnugi
Line 14: Anāku, “I.” ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant, slave.” Line 14 contains a stock
phrase that usually occurs toward the end of prayers (see page 413 for an example in this
volume and Mayer, UFBG, 282–83 for the generalization and exceptions). The word “serv-
ant” is a common way for a person addressing a social superior to demonstrate their lower
social status. The same hierarchical logic operates with regard to a deity. Balāṭu, “to live,
to be healthy.” Šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, to be(come) well, to be(come) whole.” The
text turns emphatically—notice the independent pronoun at the head of the line—to the
supplicant’s positive wishes for themselves. As in the previous lines of the petition, appro-
priate volitional forms, here precatives, are used to convey that which is desired. First
person forms, absent in the prayer since line 6, now dominate its remainder.
anāku aradkunu lubluṭ lušlim-ma
Line 15: Aššu, “concerning, on account of, because of, with respect to.” NÍG . AK . A . MEŠ
= upšaššû, “sorcery.” MU = šumu, “name,” though here something more metaphorical may
be better: “reputation, authority.” Zakû, “to be pure, to be clear.” Prepositions like aššu
and ina can be difficult to translate. Taking their range of meaning into consideration
along with the other components in the line, provide an idiomatic rendering. What does it
mean to be pure aššu sorcery ina the name of someone?
aššu upšaššê ina šumūkunu luzqi
Line 16: Arūtu, “clay pipe.” A pipe was inserted into a subterranean grave so the liv-
ing on the surface could pour libations through it to the deceased down below (as stated in
line 5). Kaṣû, “cold.” Šaqû, “to give to drink, to water, to libate.” Lines 15 and 16 are bal-
anced in terms of length and show several grammatical and phonological parallelisms.
Notice, for example, that both lines open with a prepositional phrase and end with a prec-
ative from a root comprised of a sibilant and velar consonant. Despite the grammatical
parallelism, there is conceptual movement between the lines. What is unwanted, “sorcery,”
occupies the same position in line 15 as that which will benefit from removing what is
unwanted in line 16 (“pipe,” which stands for the dead ancestors). The transfer of the
pronominal suffix –kunu from the instrumental prepositional phrase in line 15 (ina𒐊 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G HOSTS OF M Y F AMILY 1

17. bul-liṭ-ṭa-an-ni-ma dà-lí-lí-ka lud-lul
šumūkunu) to the phrase containing the object of the supplicant’s appreciation (ana
arūtīkunu) demonstrates the nature of the “deal” the supplicant is brokering in these final
lines: “you do something for me, and I will do something for you.” The precative in this
line, therefore, is not so much a wish as it is a promise to thank the deity for acting on the
supplicant’s behalf (so also in line 17). Given the general trend of the Mesopotamian cli-
mate, cold drinking water would be particularly desirable.
ana arūtīkunu mê kaṣûti lušqi
Line 17: Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to heal, to revive, to spare, to provide support for.”
Bulliṭṭānnī-ma stands here for bulliṭānnī-ma. A direct imperative here, a kind of final plea,
accentuates this line among those otherwise dominated by precatives (lines 14–17). Dalīlū,
“praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” The two form a cognate accusative. Dalīlīka (2ms) is not
expected here; rather, dalīlīkunu, “your (2mp) praises.” Given the ubiquity of the final two
words of our prayer in Mesopotamian prayers generally, we may assume the scribe rather
mechanically appended the well-known phrase in a grammatically incorrect manner. Line
17b and its parallel in line 16b form the prayer’s concluding “promise of praise.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Two issues stand out prominently in our prayer for comparative considera-
tion: the issue of benevolent ghosts in the Hebrew Bible and “honoring” one’s
deceased relatives. 1
Before looking at these two issues briefly, it is important to consider the
idea of the collective dead in the Hebrew Bible. According to some strands of
tradition, when a person died, they were “gathered to his people” (see, e.g., Gen
25:8, 17, 35:29, 49:29, 33; Num 20:24, 27:13; etc.) or “to his ancestors” (lit.
“fathers”; Judg 2:10) and believed to “lie with his ancestors” (lit. “fathers”; see,
e.g., 1 Kgs 1:21, 2:10, 11:21, 43, 14:20, 31, etc.). This manner of speaking about
the dead shows a clear conceptual connection to the situation in our prayer, in
1
Ancestor worship and necromancy in the Hebrew Bible, the two most important issues that
arise with regard to benevolent ghosts, have received considerable attention in the last several
decades. A consensus seems to have crystallized around the idea that the ancient Israelites did
practice some form of ancestor worship and did utilize necromancy, despite the biblical prohibi-
tions. For brief overviews with literature, see Theodore J. Lewis, “Ancestor Worship,” ABD
1.240–42; Idem, “Dead,” DDD, 230–31; Idem, “Teraphim,” DDD, 844–50; J. Tropper, “Spirit of
the Dead,” DDD, 806–09; and H. Rouillard, “Rephaim,” DDD, 692–00. See also the chapter enti-
tled “A Hidden Heritage: The Israelite Cult of the Dead” in Karel van der Toorn’s Family Religion
in Babylonia, Syria, and Israel, 206–35 for an important treatment; for an archaeologically-
informed presentation, see Elizabeth Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs about the
Dead (JSOTSup 123; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992). For a dissenting view, see Brian Schmidt,
Israel’s Beneficent Dead: Ancestor Cult and Necromancy in Ancient Israelite Religion and Tradition
(Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 11; Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1994; repr.
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1996).142which the dead family members sleep together in the Netherworld, a mythologi-
cal notion that reflects the use of familial tombs/graves. Archaeological evidence
from ancient Israel supports similar familial burial practices. 2
The clearest instance of a ghost in the Hebrew Bible is found in 1 Sam 28. In
this passage Saul enlists the witch of Endor to conjure Samuel’s ghost in order to
seek his guidance—an attempted necromancy (divination via the dead). Samu-
el’s apparition is called an ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ in v. 13, which probably indicates the ghost’s
preternatural powers. Despite Samuel’s apparition and true prediction about
Saul’s fate, the Deuteronomistic Historian, in line with the Deuteronomic con-
demnations of all forms of necromancy (Deut 18:9–11) and ancestor worship
(Deut 26:14), presents Saul’s actions in a negative light. This condemnation
along with many other negative evaluations of such practices elsewhere (e.g.,
Lev 19:26–28, 20:6, 27; 2 Kgs 21:6, 23:24; Isa 8:19–22 [it seems ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ and ‫ים‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫מ‬ ֵ
are used interchangeably here], 19:3 [making mention of ‫ים‬ ‫טּ‬ ִ ‫א‬,
“ghosts,” which
is probably cognate to Akk. eṭemmu], 45:18–19, 57:6, 65:4; and Ezek 43:7–9)
strongly suggest that there were people in ancient Israel who believed in the
powers of the beneficent dead and engaged in various death-related rituals.
(Why would one prohibit something if it were not occasionally practiced?) We
do not, however, have any condoned instances in the Hebrew Bible of consulting
the dead or seeking their aid, as in our Akkadian prayer. 3 This absence has led
some interpreters to the conclusion that the biblical author’s purged these popu-
lar-level practices from the official, normative form of Yahwism as presented in
the Hebrew Bible. 4
In the context of our prayer’s description of a post-mortem provisioning
(lines 4b–6), the supplicant mentions that they “honor” their deceased family
members. The verb used here is the D stem of kabātu. This verb is cognate to BH
‫כבד‬, which occurs in the D stem in the Decalogue’s command to honor one’s
father and mother (‫ָך‬ ‫מּ‬ ֶ ‫ת־א‬
‫א‬ ֶ ְ‫ו‬ ‫יָך‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ‫ת־א‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ד‬ ‫בּ‬ ֵ ‫;כּ‬
Exod 20:12, Deut 5:16; see similarly Mal
1:6). In light of what we know about ancestor veneration in ancient Israelite
popular religion, the importance of a proper burial, and the on-going importance
of familial land and gravesites, it seems plausible to suggest that part of honor-
ing one’s parents, at least at some point in the commandment’s history, included
observing the appropriate post-mortem funerary rituals, whatever they may
have been. 5 But such rituals are not, of course, the same thing as petitioning a
dead family member, as is done in our Akkadian prayer.

See Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs about the Dead, passim.
In fact, Job 14:21 and Qoh 9:4–6, 10 both present the dead as utterly impotent, ignorant, and
unable to help the living.

An Incantation-Prayer: Girra 2
C HARLES H ALTON
G IRRA :
Girra was the Mesopotamian god of fire. Starting in the Ur III period and
continuing through the Old Babylonian period, the gods Girra and Gibil, another
fire god, were distinguished. However, by the Neo-Assyrian period the gods
merged and the names Girra and Gibil were used interchangeably to refer to the
same singular deity. Girra was written logographically in Akkadian as d GIŠ . BAR
and d BIL . GI .
Girra was typically regarded as the son of Anu and his consort Shala(sh).
However, he was occasionally identified as the son of Anu and Ki, Ishkur and
Shala(sh), or as a son of Nusku. His lineage made him a middling deity with
respect to rank in the pantheon; however, since he was the god of fire this ele-
vated his importance within literature and the lives of Mesopotamians. As the
agent of Nusku, Girra is mentioned as one of the occupants of Nusku’s temple in
Nippur, É-me-lám-ḫuš, “House of Awesome Radiance.” 1
Fire is both an indispensible gift and a terrifyingly destructive force. Accord-
ingly, Mesopotamian literature reflects both of these aspects. For example, Gibil
is mentioned in Enūma eliš as one of the fifty names of Marduk in which his crea-
tive ability and wisdom is celebrated:
Gibil, the one who maintains the edge of the weapon,
Who in combat with Tiamat created wonders,
Who is vast of understanding, wise, and intelligent,
Having a mind so wide that the gods in their assembly are not able
to comprehend. (VII 115–118; my translation)
On the other hand, Girra also had a fearsome nature which is illustrated in a
poem praising Shalmaneser III’s campaign to Urartu that pairs Girra with Nergal,
the god of the underworld, in an invocation: “Go, lord of kings! [ . . . ] May Ner-
gal go before you, Girra [after you . . .]” (SAA 11 17:28–29). Girra is an appro-
priate complement to Nergal since the poem celebrates the Assyrian king’s de-
struction of the Urartian army and line 9 states that the city, Til Barsip, was
1

tions 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993), #767.
145146burned. The order of the invocation is as logical as it is chilling: Nergal goes
before Shalmaneser and kills all the people while Girra sweeps in and burns up
the carnage.
Finally, the so-called Verse Account of Nabonidus contains a stylistically
beautiful line composed of two synonymously parallel stichoi that reflect an
identification of Girra with fire:
Whatever he (Nabonidus) made, he (Cyrus) had Girra burn it up,
Whatever he made, he had fire (išātu) consume it (vi 23ʹ–24ʹ). 2
Since Girra was the god of fire he was regarded as the patron deity of met-
alworkers. Also, he was acknowledged for his role in the construction of build-
ings by providing the means to bake bricks. Appropriately, his symbol was the
torch.
T HE P RAYER :
This incantation-prayer is a part of Maqlû, “burning,” an Akkadian magical
series, consisting of eight incantation tablets (I–VIII) and one ritual tablet (IX),
that was performed at the end of the month Abu to combat illegitimate witches
and witchcraft. The first eight tablets contain almost one hundred incantations.
Tablet IX lists the incantations according to their opening words (incipit) and
describes the proper rituals to employ with each. An exorcist led the incanta-
tions and associated rituals which emphasize the innocence of the supplicant as
well as their inability to counteract their enemy. The ceremony was performed
at the supplicant’s home and began at night and was continued the following
morning. Although the ceremony was complex we may break it down into three
main parts: summoning the gods, cleansing the patient’s bedroom, and perform-
ing ceremonial washings the following morning. 3
The incantation-prayer to Girra occurs in the first part of the ritual in Tablet
II, lines 76–103. Our text begins with a brief hymnic introduction that praises
Girra’s ability to guide the divine council toward right verdicts (lines 1–9). After
the hymn is the petition section of the prayer (lines 10–24). It begins with a
standard self-presentation formula (line 10) and then follows a typical sequence.
In the first section the supplicant’s situation is described in the form of a lament
(lines 11–13). The second part contains ritual actions involving figurines (lines
15–17) followed by the recitation of several petitions (lines 18–21, 23), which
marks the end of the petition section. Finally, the prayer is concluded with
praise (lines 24–27).

The petition portion of the prayer repeats invocations in order to transition
between elements of the prayer as well as to give the composition a sense of
unity and coherence. Line 14 provides a bridge between the lament and ritual
segments by contrasting the “exalted” (šurbû) and “holy” (ellu) attributes of Girra
with the wretched description of the supplicant in the lament section. Similarly,
the last invocation (line 22) transitions between the precative petitions and the
direct, imperatival petitions in lines 23 and 24 by addressing Girra as “magnifi-
cent” (šarḫu) and “eminent among the gods” (ṣīru ša ilī).
This prayer contains many poetic features. For instance, lines 18–21 promi-
nently use repetition and consonance. Each line has the same format: šunu fol-
lowed by a precative, then anāku followed by a precative. Furthermore, some of
the lines show alliteration between the two verbs. For example, limūtū and lubluṭ
(line 18) both contain dental and labial consonants (t=ṭ and m~b). Lastly, the
pronouns in this section are emphatic and highlight the petitioner’s request that
Girra intervene and punish the supplicant’s enemies while causing the supplicant
to flourish.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer. It is not a part of the prayer itself. d GIŠ . BAR = Girra. Āriru, “burning one.” The
adj. āriru is used elsewhere to describe a blazing fire or a burning lamp (see CAD A/2,
268). Bukur is the construct state of bukru, “son.” It is common for invocations to include
genealogical information for summoned deities.
Šiptu: Girra āriru bukur Anim
Line 2: Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” Dīnu, “judgment, decision, legal case.” Dīna dânu
means “to render a verdict.” KA = atmû (atwûm), “speech, word” (see CAD P, 399). Pirištu,
“secret.” Attā, “you.” Shamash is the deity most commonly associated with judging /
judgment since he looked down on the world (and underworld during the night) and saw
all of humankind’s deeds. However, when petitioners prayed to a specific deity for help
their prayers usually included a request for the deity to render a judgement on their be-
half. For an extensive treatment of the topic of divine secrecy, see Alan Lenzi, Secrecy and
the Gods: Secret Knowledge in Ancient Mesopotamia and Biblical Israel (SAAS 19; Helsinki:
The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2008). Our line is treated briefly on p. 84, n.99.

Line 3: Iklēti (ekletu), “darkness.” Šunammuru (ŠD of namāru [nawārum]), “to shine, to
illuminate.” The form is a 2ms durative. This is a very appropriate description given Gir-
ra’s connection with fire.
iklēti tušnammar
Line 4: Ešâti is a fp from ešû, “confused.” Likewise, dalḫāti from dalhu, “mixed up,
perplexed.” Tušteššir is a 2ms Št-lexical durative from ešēru. We could normalize this verb
in accordance with the expected i-vowel that is often colored by the following r so that it
becomes e (Huehnergard §36.1), which would yield tušteššer. The Št-lexical of ešēru means
“to put and keep in order, to straighten, to set aright.” This verb is commonly used in in-
vocations of and petitions to deities that they might “clear up confusion” and “provide
justice” (see CAD E, 361 and Tawil, ALCBH, 151–52). Superficially, this line is a descrip-
tion of the deity’s character; however, it could also be seen as an implicit plea that the
deity act in accordance with this confession. This prayer contains many lines that function
similarly (see, e.g., line 25).
ešâti dalḫāti tušteššir
Line 5: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” GAL = rabû, “great.” EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision.” The –a
after the logogram is a phonetic complement, indicating the accusative case. Nadānu, “to
give.” In the form, tanamdin, –dd– dissimilates to –md–. Here nadānu used with purussû𒐋 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G IRRA 2

means “to make a decision,” but in other contexts it can also mean “to give an oracle” (see
CAD N/1, 54). Lines 5–7 describe Girra’s pivotal role in divine decision making. Since the
petitioner is seeking divine adjudication of their situation, they hope Girra will take up
their cause and persuade the other gods to act on their behalf.

Line 6: Kâta is the genitive/accusative form of the 2ms independent pronoun. Mam-
man, “somebody, anybody.” Parāsu, “to separate, to decide.” There is a variant reading of
this line which inserts the expected lā after the first sign to yield the idiom, ša lā X =
“without X.”

Line 7: Ûrtu (wuʾʾurtu), “instruction, command.” Ṭēmu, “order, decree; reason; com-
munication.”
attā-ma nādin ûrti u ṭēme
Line 8: Epēšu, “to do.” Lumnu, “evil, misery.” Arḫiš, “quickly.” Kamû, “to capture,
bind.” Maqlû does not only allow the supplicant to pray for relief from the evil spell that is
afflicting them; the ritual also includes vengeance against the person who commissioned
the magic. Therefore, lines 8 and 9 highlight the aspects of Girra’s actions that include
quickly capturing and overtaking the enemy.
ēpiš lumni attā-ma arḫiš takammu
Line 9: Lemnu, “bad, wicked.” Ayyābu (see ajābu in CAD and ajjābu in AHw), “ene-
my.” Kašādu, “to reach, to overcome.”
lemnu ayyābu takaššad arḫiš
Line 10: Anāku, “I.” NENNI = annanna (fs, annannītu), “so-and-so.” DUMU = māru,
“son.” This pronoun is used as a placeholder; during the incantation the officiant would
insert the name of the supplicant here. This line transitions from the hymnic invocations,
which describe various attributes of Girra, to the petition section of the prayer (lines 11–
24), where the supplicant begins with a description of their predicament.
anāku annanna mār annanna ša ilšu annanna ištaršu annannītu
Line 11: The transliterations and normalizations for lines 11–13 are from Abusch
(Mesopotamian Magic, 86, n.9). Kišpu, “sorcery, evil spell.” Lupputāku is a 1cs predicative of
lupputu (D of lapātu), “to afflict, to touch.” Izuzzu (uzuzzu), “to stand, to serve.” Lines 11–15012. ina

13 are similar in form: the first cola uses a predicative verb to lament the supplicant’s
cursed condition, while the second uses a preterite to describe their presence before the
deity. Mayer (UFBG, 122–45) describes the action in the second half of these cola as Hin-
wendung, the “turning.”
ina kišpi lupputākū-ma maḫarka azziz
Line 12: Abusch (“Witchcraft and the Anger of the Personal God,” 86, n.9) notes a
variant to this line: ina pān ili u amēli šuzzurākū-ma elīka x / allaka ana maḫrīka, “detestable
before god and man to you . . . I come in front of you.” IGI = pānu, “face,” though it could
also stand for maḫru, “front.” Ina pān(i)/maḫar means, “in the presence of.” LÚ = amīlu
(awīlum), “a man, a human being.” Šuzzuru (Š of nazāru), “to make detestable, to curse”
(see CAD N/2, 140, under 4. III). The form here is a 1cs predicative, which literally means
“I am made detestable.” Eli, “on, over, above, to, towards.”
ina pān ili u amēli . . . šuzzurākū-ma elīka . . .
Line 13: UGU = eli. Amāru, “to see.” Marāṣu, “to be(come) sick.” Šaplu, “under; at the
feet of.” Kamāsu, “to kneel, to bow down.”
eli āmerīya marṣākū-ma šapalka akmis
Line 14: Šurbû, “exalted, supreme.” Ellu, “pure, holy.” In contrast to the previous
three lines that describe the supplicant’s lowly condition, this line portrays Girra as exalted
and undefiled. The descriptives in this line all have –u endings and the words, ilu ellu, are
similar in sound.
Girra šurbû ilu ellu
Line 15: Eninna = inanna, “now.” Ilūtu, “divinity,” is the abstract form of ilu, “god.”
eninna ina maḫar ilūtīka rabîti
Line 16: NU = ṣalmu, “image, figurine, statue.” Kaššāpu, “sorcerer, warlock;” kaššaptu,
“witch.” LÚ and MUNUS are determinatives indicating, redundantly, the gender of the fol-
lowing nouns. ZABAR = sipparu, “bronze.” Qātukka is qātu, “hand; power; authority,” the
locative-adverbial ending –um, plus the 2ms pronominal suffix. The m assimilates to the k
of the suffix (see GAG Paradigm 5). The –um suffix corresponds to prepositional phrases in
which a genitive is proceeded by the prepositions ina or ana (see GAG §66); thus, this
phrase is translated “in your hand/power.” The statues described here were burned during
the recitation of this incantation. Afterward, the figures were trampled in water and their
remains buried (Abusch, “An Early Form of the Witchcraft Ritual Maqlû,” 123).

Line 17: Ugguru (D of egēru, “to twist”). Twisting the feet of statues was part of the Bīt
rimki rituals directed to Shamash (see J. A. Scurlock, “KAR 267//BMS 53: A Ghostly Light
on bīt rimki?,” JAOS 108.2 [1998], 203–4; see also CAD E, 42). However, the verb in the
Bīt rimki ritual (tuzār from zâru, CAD Z, 72) is different from that found in this prayer.
Foster translates this line as “I have made crossed marks(?) upon them” (661) and specu-
lates that the action of twisting refers to making cross marks on the statues. Kâša is the
dative form of the 2ms independent pronoun (GAG §41f). The verb paqādu, “to assign,
entrust,” contains an accusative 2ms pronominal suffix and likely refers to the statue while
the independent pronoun refers to the deity. The context surrounding the verb apqid indi-
cates that it should be interpreted as a performative (for more on the performative in Se-
mitic languages, see F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, “(More) On Performatives in Semitic,” ZAH 17–
20 (2004–2007), 36–81. For a discusion of this within Akkadian see GAG §79b and 80c.
Regardless of precisely what is done to the statue, the ritual intends to bring harm to the
person that cursed the patient.
maḫarka uggiršunūtī-ma kâša apqidka
Line 18: Šunu, “they.” Mâtu, “to die.” Balāṭu, “to live, to recover.” See the introduc-
tion to the prayer above for a discussion of the structure and poetic features of lines 18–
21. The content of these lines reveals the intention behind the ritual in line 17. The peti-
tioner asks Girra to reverse the effects of the curse against them and allow them to heal,
while the person who brought the curse in the first place has a time of suffering.
šunu limūtū-ma anāku lubluṭ
Line 19: Ešēru, “to be straight, to be right.” The first half of this line is difficult to
interpret. The verb should be read either as liddappirū-ma (Tzvi Abusch, personal commu-
nication) from duppuru, “to drive away, expel,” or as litebbirū-ma from abāru, “to bind.”
From the pattern in lines 18, 20–21 of antithetical parallelism, we can assume that the first
half of the line conveys the opposite sense of the second; however, ešēru is semantically
flexible, which makes the interpretation of this line more difficult.
šunu litebbirū-ma anāku lūšir
Line 20: Qatû, “to come to an end.” Mâdu (maʾādu), “to increase.”

Line 22: Šarḫu, “proud, magnificent.” Ṣīru, “outstanding, eminent.” This line reprises
the invocations in lines 1 and 14. The first three words of the phrase, šarḫu ṣīru ša ilī, all
begin with sibilants and the first two words both have r and u sounds.
Girra šarḫu ṣīru ša ilī
Line 23: Kašādu, “to defeat, to overtake.” In kušussunūtī-ma (G imperative of kašādu)
the d of kašādu assimilates into the š of the accusative 3mp suffix to form –ss– (GAG §30f
and §65b). Naḫbulu (N of ḫabālu), “to wrong, to oppress” (see CAD Ḫ, 6 for a note on this
word’s complicated semantic range). Lines 23 and 24 cluster words that begin with k, l,
and a sounds to create a sense of excitement before the unit in lines 25–27.
kāšid lemni u ayyābi kušussunūtī-ma anāku lā aḫḫabbil
Line 24: ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.” Izuzzu, see line 11. This line is a common
trope in which the supplicant promises to praise and serve the god/goddess should he/she
heal the sufferer; see Tzvi Abusch, “The Promise to Praise the God in Šuilla Prayers,” in
Biblical and Oriental Essays in Memory of Wiliam L. Moran (ed. Agustinus Gianto; BibOr 48;
Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 2005), 5.
anāku aradka lublu  lušlim-ma maḫarka luzziz
Line 25: MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. Bēlu, “lord.” The use of –ma puts focus on the
personal pronoun, “you (and not some other deity) are my god” (see GAG §123a). Lines
25–27 comprise a structural unit; the lines are bound together with the repetition of attā-
ma. Lines 25 and 26 each consist of two phrases two words in length beginning with attā-
ma. The two lines build to a crecendo into line 27, which again begins with attā-ma but is
one long line instead of two short clauses. The first two lines confess fidelity to the deity
and recognize his ability to help the petitioner. The final line is framed as a description of
the deity, yet it is a veiled plea for the deity to rise up and act in accordance with the con-
fession, “You are the one restoring my fortune.”

Line 26: Dayyānu “judge.” Rēṣu, “helper, supporter.” We would expect rēṣī here; pos-

“to return an act of kindness; to wreak vengeance” (see CAD G, 74). The logograms TU 6
and ÉN represent šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording,” and are the concluding formula ra-
ther than part of the prayer itself (see CAD Š/3, 86). They are not translated.

Line 28: The rubric, typically written in Sumerian, identifies the kind of incantation-

bronze figurines.” Ušburuda means “witchcraft-releasing.”
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Several phrases and words within the prayer to Girra are similar in structure
and meaning to biblical analogues. For instance, in line 24 the phrase maḫarka
luzziz literally means, “may I stand before you”; however, just like the analogous
phrase in BH, ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ‫עמ‬ , it is used idiomatically to indicate service to an official or
deity (HALOT, 841). For example, Num 16:9 “Does it seem too small a thing to
you that the god of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel...to
perform the service (‫ת‬ ‫ֹד‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ת־ע‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫בֹד‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫)ל‬
of Yahweh’s tabernacle and to stand before
(‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫מֹד‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ַ‫ל‬ ְ‫)ו‬ the community to minister to them (‫ם‬ ‫ת‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ְ‫”?)ל‬
This prayer also contains poetic features that are similar to those employed
by biblical writers. For instance, lines 18–21 cluster antonym word pairs within
the same line: die | live  bind | straight  expire | flourish  weak | strong. Ex-
amples of biblical passages with similar structure include Amos 5:15, “Hate evil
and love good” ( ‫טוֹב‬ ‫בוּ‬ ‫ה‬ ֱ ‫א‬ ֶ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ע‬ ‫וּ־ר‬
‫א‬ ְ‫נ‬ ‫שׂ‬ ִ ) and Psalm 107:26, “They went up to the sky /
they went down to the depths” (‫הוֹמוֹת‬ ‫)ת‬.
1
In addition to sharing certain poetic features, the psalmists and the author
of this prayer to Girra use similar divine titles and descriptions. In Ps 40:18b and
the parallel passage in Ps 70:6b the psalmist confesses, “You are my help (Ps 40,
‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ ְ‫ז‬ ‫;ע‬
Ps 70, ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫)ע‬
and my deliverer,” which is semantically similar to line 26 in
the prayer to Girra: “you are my helper” (rēṣūya). Of course confessions such as
“you are my god” and “you are my lord” in line 25 are quite common within
biblical literature (e.g., Ps 63:2: “O Elohim, (you are) my god, I search for you,”
‫ךּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ח‬ ֲ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫ה‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ; and Ps 16:2: “I said to Yahweh, ‘You are my lord,’” ‫י‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ
‫ה‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ָ ‫י‬ ָ‫ֹנ‬ ‫ד‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫ה‬ ָ‫יהֹו‬ ‫)ל‬.

The 1cs perfect has been restored on the basis of the Greek and Syriac traditions; the MT reads
‫תּ‬ ְ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬.154Even though the Bible does not contain apotropaic rituals to counter witch-
craft, it does recount rituals that contain curses. When individuals or communi-
ties concluded a covenant, curses were invoked upon whomever violated the
agreement (e.g., Exod 24). Sometimes biblical writers linked times of adversity
with these curses. For instance, the Chronicler asserts that the land finally re-
ceived its sabbath rest because Yahweh invoked the curse of exile (2 Chron
36:21; see Lev 25:4, 26:34; Jer 29:10). Instead of a declaration of innocence and
a specific ritual to ward off curses as seen in the prayer to Girra, biblical writers
prescribed confession of sin and repentance to reverse the effects of curses asso-
ciated with oaths (e.g., Lev 26:40).
Numbers 5:11–31 describes a curse embedded within a ritual used when a
man suspected that his wife committed adultery. In these instances the husband
would bring his wife before a priest. The priest mixed dust from the tabernacle
floor with holy water, and the woman took an oath denying that she had an
adulterous encounter. After this, the priest wrote curses on a scroll and washed
the ink off into the water and dust mixture. He then gave the mixture to the
woman to drink. Presumably, an innocent woman would be unharmed while a
guilty one would suffer the curses she imbibed. 3

This ritual contains several layers of meaning. For a discussion of the various communicative
dimensions, see Gerald A. Klingbeil, Bridging the Gap: Ritual and Ritual Texts in the Bible (IBRSup
1; Winona Lake, Eisenbrauns, 2007), 212–14, and for a literary and contextual treatment of this
ritual, see Richard M. Davidson, Flame of Yahweh: Sexuality in the Old Testament (Peabody: Hen-

An Incantation-Prayer: Gods of the Night 1
T ZVI A BUSCH
G ODS OF THE N IGHT :

T HE P RAYER :
Context: This address to the gods of the night is the first incantation-prayer
in the magical series Maqlû, “burning.” Maqlû is the longest and most important
Mesopotamian text concerned with combating witchcraft. This composition
comprises eight tablets of incantations and a ritual tablet. The incantation tab-
lets record the text of almost one hundred incantations directed against witches
and witchcraft; in the ritual tablet, these incantations are cited by incipit, and
alongside each citation appropriate ritual directions are prescribed. Long thought
to be a random collection of witchcraft materials, an important breakthrough in
the understanding of Maqlû came with the discovery that it was a single complex
ceremony. This ceremony was performed during a single night and into the fol-
lowing morning at the end of the month Abu (July/August). 1
But the present text of Maqlû stands at the end of a long and complex liter-
ary and ceremonial development. An earlier version of the ceremony would have
been performed in the daytime and would have begun with what is now the
sixth incantation (I 73ff.), which was originally addressed to Shamash. After the
ceremony was transferred to the nighttime, the present introductory section, I 1–
72, was added. In line with its new ceremonial context, this section now opens
with the address to the gods of the night. This opening section is an indictment
of the witch. The incantation-prayer draws together magical and legal imagery
1
For the nature of Maqlû, see I. T. Abusch, “Mesopotamian Anti-Witchcraft Literature: Texts and
Studies. Part 1: The Nature of Maqlû: Its Character, Divisions and Calendrical Setting,” JNES 33
(1974), 251–62; repr. in Tzvi Abusch, Mesopotamian Witchcraft (Ancient Magic and Divination 5;
Leiden: Brill, 2002), 99–111. For its history, see idem, “An Early Form of the Witchcraft Ritual
Maqlû and the Origin of a Babylonian Magical Ceremony,” in Lingering over Words: Studies in
Ancient Near Eastern Literature in Honor of William L. Moran (ed. T. Abusch, et al; HSS 37; Atlanta:
Scholars Press, 1990), 1–57; repr. in Abusch, Mesopotamian Witchcraft, 113–62.
157158for this purpose. It should be emphasized that this incantation-prayer is not a
simple prayer in which a stable negative situation is described and a change
asked for. Rather, it is a speech that accompanies a ritual act and gives ex-
pression to a dynamic situation. The text thus reflects the changes in state un-
dergone by the patient and the witch from the beginning of the ritual to its end.
It is possible that an earlier form of this text ended with line 20 and that lines
21–35 represent an innovation.
Structure: The incantation-prayer is in the form of a speech in the first per-
son made by the patient, who invokes the heavenly gods of Anu (lines 1–3). The
patient first presents his plaint in the form of a description of the acts that the
witch performed against him and of the resultant state (lines 4–12). On this ba-
sis, the patient asks the gods to take up his case (lines 13–14). The patient pro-
claims that he has caused the accused witch to be present in the judgment in the
form of figurines of male and female witches (lines 15–17) and asks that the
witch be punished for having sought—perhaps by means of accusations—
unmotivated evil against the patient and that the witch’s bewitchment be re-
leased (lines 18–20). The patient asks to be cleared (of bewitchment and any
imputed guilt) by means of a standard set of plants—these plants usually serve
to purify, but here they function as (an oath and) a form of juridical ordeal
(lines 21–24). The patient, having proven his innocence and having been cleared
(lines 25–26), is now able to assert that since the witch’s utterance belongs to an
evil witch, her accusation has been refuted (lines 27–28), and to ask the gods of
the night to bring the witch to justice and indict her, and the night watches to
release the witchcraft (lines 29–30). By means of a magical identification and
act, the patient expresses the wish that the organs of speech of the witch be de-
stroyed (lines 31–33). Finally, he asserts that the witch’s actions and accusations
have been wholly nullified (lines 34–35) by the gods of the night (line 36).

Lines 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This superscript marks the begin-
ning of the ritual wording; it is not part of the prayer. Šasû, “to call.” The form alsīkunūši is
a 1cs preterite plus 2mp dative suffix, which functions here as an accusative. The preterite
forms of šasû in lines 1–3 are examples of performative preterites and should be translated
“I call.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Mušītu, “night.”
alsīkunūši ilū mušīti
Line 2: Itti, “with,” bears a 2mp pronominal suffix. Kallatu, “bride.” Kuttumtu, “veiled,
covered.”
ittīkunu alsi mušītu kallatu kuttumtu
Line 3: Barārītu, “twilight.” Qablītu, “midnight.” Namārītu, “dawn.” These are the
names of the three watches of the night. U, “and.”
alsi barārītu qablītu u namārītu
Line 4: This line describes the actions of the witch; line 5, her utterances. Line 4 re-
fers to the witch’s act of silencing the victim (=speaker); line 5 refers to the witch’s act of
leveling an accusation against the victim. Aššu, “because,” at the beginning of line 4 gov-
erns lines 4–12; hence, the verbs in these lines are in the subjunctive (in this context note
amruṣu in line 7) and are singular, not plural. MUNUS . UŠ 11 . ZU = kaššaptu, “witch.” Kuššupu
(D of kašāpu), “to bewitch.” The form ukaššipanni is a 3cs preterite plus a 1cs accusative
pronominal suffix (so also the verb in line 5).
aššu kaššaptu ukaššipanni
Line 5: Elēnītu, “deceitful,” is used substantively here. Ubburu (D of abāru), “to ac-
cuse” (<“to bind”).
elēnītu ubbiranni
Line 6: DINGIR . MU = ilī, “my god.” Ištarī, “my goddess.” Šussû (Š of nesû), “to drive
away, to cause to be estranged.” The 3cs preterite is normally ušassi; ušassû adds the sub-
junctive –u. UGU . MU = elīya, “from, upon me.”

Line 7: Amāru, “to see.” The participle is used substantively and bears a 1cs pronomi-
nal suffix. Marāṣu, “to be(come) ill, sickening.” Amruṣu: so in one Nineveh MS . Other Nine-
veh MSS read am-ru-uṣ.
eli āmerīya amruṣu anāku
Line 8: Emēdu, “to beset (with).” The form is a 1cs predicative; the speaker is the
subject of this passive construction (this subject would have been the first object in an
active construction), and lā ṣalālu, “not sleeping,” is the object (it would have been the
second object in an active construction). GI 6 = mūšu, “night.” Mūša and urra are accusa-
tives of time.
emdēku lā ṣalālu mūša u urra
Line 9: Qû, lit. “thread, string,” but here “gag.” Mitallû (Gtn of malû), “to fill continu-
ally.” The form is a 3cs durative with subjunctive. KA = pû, “mouth.”
qû imtanallû pīya
Line 10: Upuntu (upumtu), a type of flour, here stands for food in general. KA . MU =
pīya (see line 9). Parāsu, “to block, to keep distant.” The verb is a 3cs preterite with sub-
junctive; qû from line 9 is the subject.
upunti pīya iprusu
Line 11: A . MEŠ = mû, “water.” Maštītu, “drinking organ.” Muṭṭû (D of maṭû), “to di-
minish.”

“wailing, mourning.”
elēlī nubû ḫidûtī sipdi
Line 13: Izuzzu, “to stand”; here izuzzu connotes participation in a judicial proceed-
ing. The form is a cp impv. with 1cs dative pronominal suffix. DINGIR . MEŠ GAL . MEŠ = ilū
rabûtu, “great gods.” Šemû, “to hear,” is also in the form of a cp impv. Dabābu, “to speak.”𒐌 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G ODS OF THE N IGHT 1

The inf. with 1cs pronominal suffix is functioning nominally; thus, “my speaking,” which
denotes here the supplicant’s legal case against the witch.
izizzānim-ma ilū rabûtu šimâ dabābī
Line 14: Dīnu, “legal case.” Dânu (diānu), “to judge.” Alaktu here has the meaning
“(oracular) decision.” Alaktu, from alāku, “to go,” refers to the movements of heavenly
bodies. Lamādu normally means “to learn, to come to know,” but in this context the verb
has a revelatory connotation. The phrase dīnī dīnā alaktī limdā here is equivalent to dīnī
dīnā purussâya pursā, “judge my case, give a decision.” See T. Abusch, “Alaktu and Hala-
khah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 (1987), 15–42.
dīnī dīnā alaktī limdā
Line 15: Epēšu, “to do, to make.” The form is a 1cs preterite. NU = ṣalmu, “image,
figurine.” LÚ . UŠ 11 . ZU , MUNUS . UŠ 11 . ZU = kaššāpu, “warlock,” kaššaptu, “witch.”
ēpuš ṣalam kaššāpīya u kaššaptīya
Line 16: Ša, “of.” Ēpišu, “sorcerer.” Muštēpištu, “the woman who instigates sorcery,” or
perhaps in some instances, just “sorceress.” Ēpišu is sometimes coupled with ēpištu.
ša ēpišīya u muštēpištīya
Line 17: Šakānu, “to set, to place.” The performative preterite here has the force of a
punctual present, “I set (it).” Ina šapli idiomatically means “at the feet (of).” The noun
bears a 2mp pronominal suffix. The durative adabbub has the force of a durative present, “I
am (now) pleading.”
aškun ina šaplīkunū-ma adabbub dīnī
Line 18: Aššu, see line 4. Epēšu, “to perform” here. The witch is the subject; the sup-
plicant is the referent of the 1cs dative suffix (–am, with loss of final m, –a). Lemnu, “evil.”
Šiteʾʾû (Gtn of šeʾû), “to seek constantly.” The form is a 3cs preterite with a 1cs dative pro-
nominal suffix. Banû, “good.” Both adjectives are fem. pl.
aššu īpuša lemnēti išteʾʾâ lā banâti
Line 19: Šī, “she.” Mâtu, “to die.” Anāku, “I.” Balāṭu, “to live, to be well.” Both verbs
are precative: the first is 3cs, referring to the supplicant’s wish for the witch; the second is
1cs, referring to the supplicant’s desire for himself.

Line 20: Kišpū (usually plural), ruḫû, and rusû are all words referring to sorcery.
Pašāru, “to release.” Lū pašrū is a precative in lū, “may, let,” plus the 3mp predicative
form. It is possible that this construction is an asseverative: “verily are her witchcraft . . .
released.”
kišpūša ruḫûša rusûša lū pašrū
Line 21: The main verbs in lines 21–24 are all precatives with a 1cs pronominal accu-
sative suffix; each initial half of the line names a plant and is followed by the precative
verb, indicating the supplicant’s wish for what the plant should do to him. GIŠ . ŠINIG = bīnu,
“tamarisk.” Ullulu (D of elēlu), “to clear.” The relative clause introduced by ša modifies
tamarisk. Qimmatu, “crown,” here is an accusative of respect. Šarû, “to be copious,” is a
3ms predicative with subjunctive.
bīnu lillilanni ša qimmatu šarû
Line 22: GIŠ . GIŠIMMAR = gišimmaru, “date-palm,” is feminine here (see māḫirat).
Pašāru, see line 20. Lipšuranni is a 3cs precative plus a 1cs accusative suffix. Māḫirat is a fs
participle in construct from maḫāru, “to withstand,” it modifies date-palm. Kalû, “all, total-
ity.” IM = šāru, “wind.”
gišimmaru lipšuranni māḫirat kalû šāri
Line 23: Ú . IN . NU . UŠ = maštakal, “soapwort,” is feminine here (see malâta). Ubbubu (D
of ebēbu), “to cleanse.” KI -tì = erṣeti, “earth.” Malû, “to be(come) full, to fill.” Malâta is a
3fs transitive parsāku form. Both here and in line 24 malâta is in the subjunctive.
maštakal libbibanni ša erṣeti malâta
Line 24: GIŠ . ŠE . Ù . SUḪ 5 = terinnatu, “cone,” is usually understood as the plural of terin-
nu and transcribed terinnātu, but note here the singular verb form malâta. In this line,
malâta is intransitive. ŠE . AM = šeʾu, “grain,” indicates the seeds with which the cone is
filled.
terinnatu lipšuranni ša šeʾa malâta
Line 25: Ina maḫri, “before, in the presence of.” Elēlu, “to be(come) pure.” The verbs
ētelil, ētebib, and azzaku in lines 25–26 are in the perfect, indicating that the state of clean-
liness or innocence described has now been achieved as a result of the wishes of the previ-
ous lines (21–24). All three verbs are 1cs. Kīma, “like, as.” Ú . KI . KAL = sassatu, “grass.”

Line 26: Ebēbu, “to be(come) clean.” Zakû, “to be(come) innocent.” The t of the per-
fect assimilates to the z of the root (–zt– becomes –zz–). Lardu, “nard.”
ētebib azzaku kīma lardi
Line 27: Tû, “spell, incantation.” Lemutte is an adjective, “evil,” modifying kaššaptu
(“her spell being that of an evil witch”), and not the predicate of the clause. Note the
transformations in our text achieved by the use of forms of lemēnu as additions or replace-
ments: thus kaššaptu in line 4 becomes kaššaptu lemutte here in line 27; aššu . . . ukaššipanni
. . . ubbiranni in lines 4–5 becomes aššu īpuša lemnēti in line 18.
tûša ša kaššapti lemutte
Line 28: Turru (D of târu), “to turn back.” The form of both turrat and kaṣrat is a 3fs
predicative. INIM -sa = amāssa: amātu (awātum), “word,” plus a 3fs pronominal suffix (–tš–
becomes –ss–). EME = lišānu, “tongue.” The n assimilates to the š of the 3fs pronominal
suffix. Kaṣāru, “to tie up, to bind.”
turrat amāssa ana pīša lišāšša kaṣrat
Line 29: ina UGU = ina muḫḫi, lit., “on top of”; here “on account of.” Maḫāṣu, “to
strike.” The form of limḫaṣūši is a 3mp precative plus a 3fs accusative suffix. Here maḫāṣu
connotes intimidation, humiliation, and accusation. Ilū mušīti, “the gods of the night,” are
the subjects of the verb.
ina muḫḫi kišpīša limḫaṣūši ilū mušīti
Line 30: 3 = šalāš. EN . NUN . MEŠ = maṣṣarātu (sg. maṣṣartu), “observation, guard,
watch.” The reading lip-šu-ra ! is an emendation of lip-šu-ru; the attested forms in the MSS
are lipšurū, lipšur, and lipašširū. In view of the divergence in the readings, the verb should
be emended to lipšurā in agreement with the feminine plural subject (maṣṣarātu).
šalāš maṣṣarātu ša mūši lipšurā ruḫêša lemnūti
Line 31: Lū, “may it be.” Ì . UDU = lipû (lipium), “tallow.” MUN = ṭabtu, “salt.”
pūša lū lipû lišāšša lū ṭabtu
Line 32: Qabû, “to speak.” In view of the equations in line 31, it is clear that, contrary
to most earlier translations, the subject of iqbû here must be pû, “mouth,” and that of īpušu16433. šá i-pu-šú kiš-pi ki-ma MUN liš-ḫar-miṭ

in line 33 must be lišānu, “tongue.” ḪUL -tì = lemutti, “evil, wickedness.” Itattuku (Gtn of
natāku), “to drip ever away.” The form of the verb is 3cs precative.
ša iqbû amāt lemuttīya kīma lipî littattuk
Line 33: Lišḫarmiṭ is a Š precative 3cs from naḫarmuṭu, “to dissolve.” There is a vari-
ant that reads liḫḫarmiṭ, an N precative 3cs. Semantically, liḫḫarmiṭ seems to be the better
reading, but it is only attested in two MSS , one Babylonian, the other from Nippur, whereas
lišḫarmiṭ is found in four MSS , including all Nineveh texts.
ša īpušu kišpī kīma ṭabti lišḫarmiṭ
Line 34: Kiṣru, “bond, knot.” Puṭṭuru (D of paṭāru), “to release.” Ḫulluqu (D of ḫalāqu),
“to nullify.” Both puṭṭurū and ḫulluqā are predicatives; the former is 3mp, the latter 3fp.
The reading ḫulluqā is to be preferred over the variant ḫulluqū because its subject is a fem-
inine plural noun epšētūša, “her deeds.” Lines 34–35 assert that the actions (line 34) and
the utterances (line 35, actually accusations) of the witch have been nullified. These two
lines parallel the initial description of the witch’s deeds in lines 4–5: 34  4 and 35  5.
kiṣrūša puṭṭurū epšētūša ḫulluqā
Line 35: Kal, “all” (see kalû in line 22). Amâtu is the plural of amātu (see line 28). A
variant in this line shows the precative limlâ rather than malâ (compare line 23). EDIN =
ṣēru, “field.”
kal amâtūša malâ ṣēra
Line 36: Ina qibīt, “according to the command of/that.” Qibīt in construct introduces a
subordinate clause, which follows in the second half of the line. TU 6 . ÉN marks the end of
the ritual wording (compare ÉN in line 1). This last line sounds like a standard legitimating
formula and therefore blurs the boundary between supplicatory and incantatory speech
(see page 20 in the general introduction). Note, however, the variant in line 35, which, if
accepted, would give this last sentence a very different tone.

nies a dynamic ritual and thus gives expression to the changes in state experi-
enced by the patient and witch throughout the ritual. In this context we note
that some psalms of individual lament seem, because of the apparent use of the
perfect, to contain not only the petitioner’s prayer, but also an expression of
trust that the deity has heard him (e.g., Ps 6). Some have taken this to mean that
the psalm is part of a ritual and that the statement of confidence is the suppli-
cant’s response to the deity’s decision spoken by the priest in the form of an ora-𒐌 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G ODS OF THE N IGHT 1

cle after the prayer itself, an interpretation to which I do not subscribe. But
should this interpretation be correct, then the laments containing the statement
of confidence should be compared to our incantation-prayer, for they too would
have been part of a dynamic ritual. 1
As noted earlier, this incantation-prayer was recited at night to the gods of
the night sky. For biblical texts recited as part of a night ritual, see, e.g., Hans-
Joachim Kraus, Psalms 1–59: A Continental Commentary (trans. Hilton C. Oswald;
Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 179.
For a description of the evil actions of one’s enemies and their unjust accu-
sations, as well as the victim’s imprecations against these enemies, see Ps 109.
For the prohibition against witchcraft in the Hebrew Bible, see Exod 22:17.
Pentateuchal legislations object to some practices of divination and magic large-
ly because these practices are associated with foreigners (e.g., Deut 18:9ff., Lev
19:26, 31, and 20:6, 27). Magic and monotheism are not incompatible, and of
course magic was practiced in ancient Israel. 2
Sigmund Mowinckel argued with some justice that ‫ן‬ ֶ‫ו‬ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫י‬ ֵ‫ל‬ ‫פּוֹע‬
of the Psalms
were malevolent magicians similar to the Mesopotamian witches (see his
Psalmenstudien I: ʾÅwän und die individuellen Klagepsalmen (Kristiania: in Kommis-
sion bei Jacob Dybwad, 1921).
A few points of specific interest in the Hebrew Bible: For line 14, compare
perhaps usages of ‫יב‬ ‫ר‬ ִ involving God adjudicating a case (see, e.g., Pss 35:1,
63:1). Alaktu in line 14 with the meaning “(oracular) decision” should be com-
pared with later Hebrew and Aramaic ‫הלכתא‬ / ‫הלכה‬. For the meaning of the Ak-
kadian and the relationship with the Hebrew terms, see Abusch, “Alaktu and
Halakhah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 (1987), 15–42. For the
cleansing motif in lines 21–24, compare Ps 51:4. With the striking in line 29, see
Ps 3:8, “deliver me, O my God! For you slap all my enemies in the face; you
break the teeth of the wicked.” For line 32 and the melting of wax, see Mic 1:4
and Ps 68:3.

An Incantation-Prayer: Ishtar 24
A NNA E LISE Z ERNECKE
I SHTAR :
Ishtar (Sum. Inana) is the most prominent goddess of the Mesopotamian
pantheon, of prime importance in all stages of history, and venerated in many
(most!) places (e.g., Arbela, Ashur, Niniveh, Uruk, and Babylon), partly with
special names. 1 Different genealogical places in the pantheon are attributed to
her: Inana / Ishtar can be described as daughter of An, the god of heaven, or of
Sin, the moon-god (see Ishtar 2:5, 105 on pages 261 and 278 of this volume). In
contrast to other female deities, she is often not the wife of a mighty god but
independent, though in Sumerian sources she can be An’s consort or, in Ashur,
married to the god Ashur. Her most prominent husband is Dumuzi (biblical
Tammuz; Ishtar 24 was transmitted as part of a ritual for Ishtar and Dumuzi). As
she is the epitome of a female goddess, from Old Babylonian times onwards, her
name with the divine determinative ( d ištaru) is used as an appellative, meaning
“goddess,” 2 especially—with suffix—for the personal protective deity (see Ishtar
2:39, 67, 68, 86, beginning on page 267 of this volume). She is the goddess of
the planet Venus in both its form as evening star and morning star. Most often,
she is characterized as goddess of love, sexuality, and war. 3 This combination of
“competences” has been explained as the result of the fusion of several deities. 4
Several sources emphasize her androgynity. 5 Interestingly, her sexual aspect
does not make her a mother-goddess—she is only rarely presented as mother,
though her stay in the Netherworld results in the loss of fertility. 6 She is promi-
nent in several mythical texts, either as a warlike goddess (e.g. Descent to the

169170Netherworld, Agushaya) or, mostly in lyrical compositions, as beloved of Du-
muzi. 7 Ishtar is often associated with lions.
In both prayers addressed to her that are part of this volume (Ishtar 2 and
24), her astral and warlike aspects are particularly stressed. Especially in Ishtar
2, she is the great and omnipotent goddess whose competence is universal and
who can save from the realm of chaos and death. She is the high goddess, the
addressee in case of problems with the personal protective deities (see Ishtar
2:85, 86 on page 275). This coincides with the fact that there is only dubious
evidence that she was anyone’s personal deity herself, though her minister
Ninshubur is known in this function. 8
Both prayers, and especially their invocations, cannot be read as “dogmatic
treatises” of Ishtar’s characteristics. Rather, they emphasize those aspects that
are important for the intention of the text: the supplicant wants something,
therefore they stress, on the one hand, the characteristics appealed to, and, on
the other, traits that they experience and interpret them in a positive way.
Ishtar is related to the levantine Astarte 9 and is one of the probable candi-
dates for the identification of the “queen of heaven” (‫השׁמים‬ ‫)מלכת‬ in Jer 7:18;
44:17–19, 25. 10 In addition, the name Esther (‫ר‬ ‫תּ‬ ֵ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫)א‬
has been discussed as possi-
bly derived from Ishtar. 11

The text of the prayer is transmitted with small variants in six manuscripts.
As none of them is unbroken, though three of them transmit the prayer in its
entirety, the text given here is eclectic and usually follows the majority of the
manuscripts.
The prayer is transmitted in different ritual contexts. The editions of Farber
and Schwemer both publish manuscripts in which it forms part of a ritual ad-
dressed to Ishtar and Dumuzi. The supplicant is suffering because magical rites
have been performed against them; figurines of them have been buried in a
grave. The ritual aims at liberating the supplicant from the netherworld while
sending the sorcerers into it. The mythical background for the ritual is Ishtar’s
descent into the netherworld. 13 The prayer is the first spoken part of the ritual

after the preparations. Nevertheless, the supplicant does not introduce them-
selves by name; it is inscribed on the figurine of them which is formed before
the recitation of the prayer.
The prayer begins with an invocation (lines 1–8) in which Ishtar’s greatness
is praised, especially the effect of her command (ina qibītīki Ištar, lines 4 and 7)
on the suffering. In the following lines (9–14), the supplicant presents them-
selves as suffering and appealing to Ishtar, asking her to decide their case and
hoping to witness her aspects just praised. In lines 15–22, the machinations of
sorcerers are identified as the root of the supplicant’s sufferings, ending with the
proclamation of the decision to act magically against them (line 22). The prayer
ends (23–27) with the supplicant’s entrusting themselves to Ishtar’s might and
pleas.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, the superscription of the prayer, which is not part of the text to be
recited. Šiptu is usually translated as “incantation” (CAD Š/3, 86); but it should be under-
stood as a technical term for the beginning of the text to be recited in a ritual; thus, “ritual
wording” or the like. KÙ = ellu, “pure, clean, holy.” Šaqû (m), šaqūtu, šaqītu (f), “high,
elevated”; as the adjective is the regens of a construct chain, the –u at the end is not ex-
pected. DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū “gods.” Igigû, the gods of heaven, see Ishtar 2, notes to line 3. In
MS HH, the line is longer: šaqūt ilī šaruḫti Igigî, “most high among the gods, splendid one of
the Igigi!” (Šarḫu, “proud, splendid.”) In all preserved texts, the name Ishtar (lines 1, 4, 7,
8, 15) is written differently, the single MSS are not consistent: d INANA , d 15 , and d IŠ 8 . DAR .
šiptu: elletum Ištar šaqūtu ilī Igigî
Line 2: Epēšu, “to do, to make.” This verb is used four times in this prayer (lines 2, 14
twice, and 22). In all other contexts, its special connotation is important: besides the neu-
tral sense “to do,” it can also mean “to perform” (a ritual, magic, especially hostile magic,
‘Schadenzauber’; see Schwemer, Rituale, 1, n.2.). Anuntu, “fight, combat.” Šakānu, “to put,
to place, to arrange.” Tuquntu (tuqumtu), “battle.” Note Ishtar 2:6 (page 261): the second
part of the line is identical.
ēpišat anunti šākinat tuqunti
Line 3: Gitmālu (m), gitmāltu (f), “perfect, ideal.” d 15 is not only a way of writing the
name of the goddess Ishtar, but also the noun ištaru, “goddess.” As gitmāltu ištarāti is a
construct chain, the case vowel ending gitmāltu is not expected.
šaruḫtu gitmāltu ištarāti
Line 4: Qibītu, “command, order.” The suffix is written –ka (2ms) here rather than the
expected –ki (2fs), but it certainly refers to Ishtar. Ina qibītīka / qibītīki at the head of this
line connects the line to lines 7 and 23. Ušteššerē is 3fp durative from šutēšuru (Št pass. of
ešēru), “to be put in order, to be guided aright.” Tenēštu, “people, personnel,” pl. tenēšētu,
“humankind.” The ending is grammatically nominative. In lines 4–11 the reading in MS HH
is partly different. These differences are normalized and translated at the end of every
note. Variant HH: ina qabêki Ištar iššerā te[nēšētu], “at your speaking, Ishtar, humankind is
well.”
ina qibītīka Ištar ušteššerē tenēšēte
Line 5: LÚ . GIG = marṣu, “sick person.” Balāṭu, “to live, to be healed.” Amāru, “to see,
to look at.” The participle, which modifies marṣu, is bound to the following substantive ( IGI
= pānū, “face”). An “overhanging” u on a participle in construct is not uncommon in SB𒐍 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : I SHTAR 24

the invocation is structured by the effects of seeing her face on the suffering (lines 5, 8).

to be read biti. Nāṭilu, “seeing”; lā nāṭilu, “blind.” IGI . LÁ = amāru, “to see, to look at.” d ZÁ-
LAG = nūru, “light.” Variant HH: lā nāṭi[lu, “the blin[d one . . . ].”
ina qibītīki Ištar lā nāṭilu immar nūra
Line 8: See line 5. Ešēru, “to be well, to thrive, to prosper.” Išaru, “straight, right, in
order”; lā išaru, “not right.” The participle āmiru modifies lā išaru. See Ishtar 2:41. HH:
iššer Ištar lā išaru ina [ . . . ], “the unfortunate becomes all right, Ishtar, in. . . .”
iššer Ištar lā išaru āmiru pānīki
Line 9: Anāku, “I.” Šumruṣu, “suffering” (adj.). The use of šumruṣu refers back to the
praise of Ishtar’s effect on the marṣu (line 5; marṣu and šumruṣu come from the same root).
IGI = maḫru, “front”; (ina) maḫar, “before, in the presence of (someone).” Kamāsu, “to
kneel, to squat down.” Izuzzu, “to stand, to serve, to be present.” Kamāsu and izuzzu are
both preterites which can be interpreted as performative (Koinzidenzfall); see Mayer,
UFBG, 181–209. Variant HH: anāku šumruṣāku maḫarki [ . . . ], “I am suffering, in front of
you [ . . . ].”
anāku šumruṣu maḫarki akmis azziz
Line 10: Dipāru, “torch.” The fem. form only occurs here. Dânu (diānum), “to judge,”
often with dīnu (“legal decision, lawsuit”) as object (figura etymologica). The verb is an
infinitive with a locative-adverbial suffix (see Farber, 253; GAG §66f) in two MSS (aa, gg);
the other two MSS (b, HH) read dânu. Saḫāru, “to go around, to turn (to), to search.” Again,
the preterite is performative.

ludes to ippaṭṭar eʾiltašu in line 6. Kasītu, “(magical) constraint”; see line 6 in MS HH, which
mentions the kasû, “bound, captive.” Variant HH: usḫī murṣī lippaṭ[ir. . . ], “tear out my
illness, may it be loosened [ . . .].”

Line 12: It is a bit of a problem to determine from which verb tumarrê is derived.
Farber, 253, analyzes it tentatively as a G or D stem 2fs durative from marû, “to do slow-
ly”; see Seux, 458, n.6. Ešû, “confused.” Dalḫu, “troubled, disturbed.”
lā tumarrê ešâku u dalḫāku
Line 13: Tarkullu, “wooden post, pole.” Maḫṣu, “beaten, smitten.” Emû (ewûm), “to
become.” The form is a 3fs predicative. ZI = napištu, “throat, life, self.”
kīma ša ina tarkullī maḫṣu emât napištim
Line 14: Epēšu, “to do, to make.” See line 2. Epiš is a 3ms predicative; ēpuš is a 1cs
preterite. Qabû, “to say, to speak, to command.”

Line 15: d INANA = Ištar. Lū . . . lū, “either . . . or.” Kaššāpu, “sorcerer.” Kaššaptu, “sor-

Ištar lū kaššāpī lū kaššaptī
Line 16: Attī, “you” (2fs). Tīdê (2fs) and īdû (1cs with subjunctive) are forms of edû,

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The supplicant in Ishtar 24 is not mentioned alone, but is involved in differ-
ent relations. As it is usual also in biblical psalms of individual lament, there is
an “I” (the supplicant), a “you” (the deity), and a “them” (a group of “others”).
The complaints can be directed in these three directions: they can be “I-
complaints” (see lines 12b, 13), “god-complaints” (not in Ishtar 24), or com-
plaints against the hostile group, here the sorcerer or sorceress (lines 15–20). 1 In
the Psalms, the hostile group consists usually of enemies, whose affronting acts
are the objects of complaints (see, e.g., Ps 13:5. 38:20–21) and whose threaten-
ing character can be compared to wild and deadly animals (see Ps 22:13–14, 17,
and 22). The general similarity has led to the interpretation that the enemies in
the Psalms are not only a structural parallel to the Mesopotamian sorcerers in
the three dimensions of relations in prayers, but that their evil actions are to be
interpreted as magical. 2 The prayer Ishtar 24 indicates that this interpretation is
at least not obvious. The eight lines dealing with the sorcerers (lines 15–22) and
already some passages in the earlier complaints show the well-developed Meso-
potamian terminology for witchcraft: besides the generic term kišpu (“witch-

craft”, line 17) and the related nouns kaššāpu and kaššaptu (“wizard / sorcerer”
and “witch / sorceress”, line 15), there are special terms for malevolent magical
practices: zikurudû (“cutting of life,” line 17), nakās napišti (“cutting the throat /
life,” line 20) and even the description of magical acts (the laying of figures of a
person in a grave as in line 19). There is also epēšu, a verb with special connota-
tions in magical contexts (lines 2, 14, and 22), which the supplicant uses for
their actions against the sorcerers (line 22). 3 The descriptions of the enemies in
the Psalms show no such specialized terminology but are much more ambiguous,
though the enemies still seem to be surrounded by a “demonic atmosphere.” 4

See the note on line 2. For the terminology, see Schwemer, Rituale, 1, n.2. The ritual in which
Ishtar 24 is embedded in at least three of the MSS aims at doing what the supplicant mentions in
line 22: the figure representing them is saved from the netherworld and cleaned, the figures
representing the sorcerer and sorceress are sent into the netherworld as their substitute; see
Schwemer, Abwehrzauber, 215–17.

An Incantation-Prayer: Nusku 12
D UANE S MITH
N USKU :
Nusku was the god of fire and lamp/torch light. Iconographically, he is rep-
resented by a lamp. In some texts, he is the son of Enlil, in others of Anu. At
Harran in northern Syria, where he seems to have had a cult center, he is the
son of Sin. 1 As Parpola suggests, 2 Nusku may have been worshiped as the god of
the crescent moon at some locations. At least at Harran, and perhaps elsewhere,
Nusku is associated with the moon. He has an important relationship with Sha-
mash. 3 As the present prayer indicates, he is the tappê Šamaš, “the companion of
Shamash.” While never among the most prominent Mesopotamian gods, Nusku
was venerated for a very long time, with evidence of his worship extending from
the Old Akkadian (2350–2120 BCE ) to the Hellenistic periods (330–30 BCE ). 4
There were two temples dedicated to him at Nippur. There were also shrines
dedicated to him at Babylon in the Marduk temple complex and at Dur Untash
(modern Chogha Zanbil) in Elam. Many of Nusku’s roles and traits are nearly
identical to those of Girra, also a god of fire (see page 145). Three of his roles
are particularly important in understanding the present prayer: a guardian of the
night, a courier of dreams, and, like Shamash, an anti-magician. 5 When called
upon, Nusku could reverse ominous portents or magical spells. The following
lines from Maqlû exemplify this role. 6

T HE P RAYER :
This prayer to Nusku is part of an apotropaic ritual whose purpose is to
provide relief from a dream with a possible bad portent. 7 The text introduces the
prayer with a simple indication of direct speech, umma šū-ma—in fact, this is
part of the ritual instructions. Unlike the common tri-partite structure of most
prayers, this prayer has two parts: an extremely short invocation and a compli-
cated petition, as the following indicates.
I) Invocation (lines 1–2a)
A) Name, relationship, and function
II) Petition (2b–11)
A) Plea for help (2b)
B) Nature of concern (2c–4)
1) Potential bad portents from a dream
2) Time of dream
3) Nature of knowledge of dream
a) The god’s
b) The supplicant’s
C) Request for remedy (5–7a)
1) In the case of a positive dream
2) In the case of a negative dream
a) Request that portent not be effective
b) Statement of disassociation
D) Ritual analogies and final petition (7b–11)
1) Like this reed

The prayer begins on line 3 of fragments K.3333+K.8583+Sm.1069, hereafter called MS A.
Another now very fragmentary tablet that once contained all or part of the incantation is 79-7-8,
77, rev. 1′–18′, hereafter called MS B.𒑆 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : N USKU 12
181
2) Like this hem
3) Final request
The prayer begins with an invocation that calls upon Nusku as judge and
companion of Shamash, the consummate judge, and asks that Nusku judge the
supplicant’s case. The petition begins by recounting a dream. The supplicant is
concerned about the portent of a dream that he had had the previous night. He
uses only an indefinite time formula, ina bararti qablīti šāt urri, to identify the
dream. The supplicant acknowledges that Nusku will certainly understand the
dream’s portent even if he does not. But there is a further concern. Not knowing
the portent of the dream, the supplicant does not know if it is for good or evil.
He asks Nusku to remove any evil portent while preserving benefits of any good
portent. But the major concern remains any potential negative consequence of
the dream. At this point, the supplicant asks that he be permanently dissociated
from the dream even to the point of asking that it not be his. The supplicant
then references the just completed ritual using its symbolic acts as analogies for
his requested dissociation from any evil portent of the dream. This rather convo-
luted sentence ties back to the opening of the petition by restating the time for-
mula. Finally, the prayer has the supplicant summarize the petition, “may it not
be mine.”
Although only fragmentary portions of the accompanying ritual are now ex-
tant, Butler was able to glean several important elements from these. In the por-
tion of the ritual just before the prayer, the supplicant’s hem is cut off and held
along with a reed(?) before a lamp, the symbol of Nusku. After the prayer is
spoken, it appears that the reed is snapped and wrapped(?) in the hem. Another
brief prayer follows. The ground is touched and the lamp lit. Finally, the suppli-
cant prays (again?) to his personal deities and to the lamp. 8
Oppenheim suggested the supplicant had forgotten the worrisome dream
but Butler argues, I think correctly, that it was the nature of the dream’s portent
that was unknown to the supplicant. 9 The portent may be good; but then again it
may be awful. The supplicant therefore seeks relief from any negative portent
without forfeiting any possible good that may come of it.
Even though he could find no physical join, Oppenheim 10 suggested as a
“working hypothesis” that the most complete witness to this prayer, MS A, be-
longed to Tablet I of the series Zīqīqu, the Assyrian Dream Book. He based his
suggestion on orthography and the double line column separator. Be this as it
may, there can be no doubt that our prayer is part of the same oneiromantic
tradition as Zīqīqu.

of the ritual portions of the tablets, most of it is unreadable. I therefore have not included it
below.

Line 1: Umma šū-ma is not part of the prayer proper. Umma indicates the beginning of
direct discourse. Šū-ma refers to the person offering the prayer. The –ma tightly ties umma
šū to what follows . d PA . KU ( d PA - TÚG ) = the god Nusku. d UTU = the god Shamash (see page
197). Tappû, here in the acc., has a range of meanings from “business partner” to “neigh-
bor” to “companion” (see CAD T, 184–90). Syntactically, attā, “you,” belongs to the next
line.
umma šū-ma Nusku tappê Šamaš

Line 2: This line begins with three forms of dânu (diānum), “to judge,” that are part of
two separate but related clauses: dayyānāta, 2ms predicative; dīnu, “case, verdict, punish-
ment” or the like, with 1cs suffix; and dīn, G impv. This same three-word stock expression
occurs elsewhere with reference to other gods (see CAD D, 101). Of particular significance
is KAR 252 iii 4, which reads, Šamaš dayyānāta dīnī dīn, “Shamas, you are the judge. Judge
my case!” Nearly identical language is used of Girra in Maqlû II 69–90. See Oppenheim,
300, for a translation and discussion. See also Maqlû I 76, Nusku dayyānu, “Nusku is the
judge.” Such language is common with reference to Shamash and Adad but not so common
with Nusku. The two clauses and their use of the same root provide a transition from the
brief invocation to the petition. Nusku is a judge. Now it is time for him to judge the sup-
plicant’s case. MÁŠ . GE 6 = šuttu, “dream,” is accompanied by the demonstrative pronoun
annītu, “this.”

Line 3: The ša introduces a relative clause, whose verb is ibbablam-ma in line 4. The
clause further defines the dream. Barartu (barārītu), “evening watch.” Qablīti, “middle
(watch).” Šāt urri, “morning watch.” The line means little more than “some unknown time
during the night or early morning.”
ša ina bararti qablīti šāt urri
Line 4: Nabbulu (N of babālu, related to [w]abālu), “to be carried, to be brought.” The
ventive suffix on the verb prevents it from showing the subjunctive, which is expected in a
subordinate (relative) clause (see ša in line 3). The –ma is conjunctive. Because of the par-
allel with the first person form of idû, “to know,” in the second half of the line, there can
be little doubt that Ì . ZU = tīdû, “you know,” in the first half. IGI . ZU is a far more common
writing for this root. Ša attā tīdû anāku lā īdû is a version of a stock formula found in many
prayers. Butler argues that we would expect kullu ( DIB ) rather than idû if the supplicant
simply didn’t remember the dream (92). Although our text has the Sumerogram Ì . ZU for
tīdû, Ì . ZU can also stand, on occasion, for asû, “physician,” or even bārû, “diviner.” See CAD
A, 344 and B, 121 for examples. In light of this, one might consider the possibility of what
Scott Noegel calls a “visual (purely based on orthography)” as opposed to an “oral (based
only on sound)” pun between Ì . ZU and īdû (see his Nocturnal Ciphers: The Allusive Language
of Dreams in the Ancient Near East [New Haven: American Oriental Society, 2007], 1, n.2).
If such a pun were involved, the orthography, but not the pronunciation, would further
contrast Nusku’s knowledge ( Ì . ZU ) with the supplicant’s lack of knowledge (lā īdû) and
simultaneously imply extending Nusku’s range of knowledge to include healing and divi-
nation.
ibbablam-ma ša attā tīdû anāku lā īdû
Line 5: damqat is from damāqu, “to be(come) good.” In dreams and omens, dumqu,
(dumuq is the bound form) means “favorable interpretation”; see CAD D, 180–81. The
writing a-a = ayy-, “may it not,” is the vetitive prefix, which indicates a negative wish.
Šêṭu here, as in other prayers and curses, means “to leave, to bypass, to escape (me)” (see
CAD Š/2, 344).
šumma damqat dumuqša ayy-išīṭanni
Line 6: ḪUL = lemnet, a 3fs predicative from lemēnu, “to be(come) bad,” parallel to
damqat in line 7. ḪUL -šá = lumun-ša = lumušša, “its evil.” Kašādu, “to reach, to arrive.”
Kašādu is often associated with the arrival of diseases and other misfortunes, including
death; see CAD K, 278.

Line 7: Yattun, “mine,” is a fs form of yā’u (see also line 11). Alan Lenzi discusses
lines 6–12—specifically the phrase lā yattun šī here and in line 12—in the context of the
stock expression šiptu ul ya/uttun, “the incantation is not mine.” Notice that in our text the
stock phrase has been turned into a wish, a subjunctive as indicated by lā rather than its
more common indicative mood with ul (“Siptu ul Yuttun: Some Reflections On A Closing
Formula In Akkadian Incantations,” in Gazing on the Deep: Ancient Near Eastern and Other
Studies in Honor of Tzvi Abusch [ed. Jeffrey Stackert, Barbara Nevling Porter, and David P.
Wright; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2010], 131–66, here 161). The word kīma, “as, like,” intro-
duces the first ritual analogy of the prayer. GI = qanû, “reed.” Naṭpu, “torn out,” is a ver-
bal adjective from naṭāpu, “to tear out, to uproot” (see CAD N/2, 128) with a subjunctive
(–u) suffix. Kīma marks the beginning of a very long, complex sentence with several subor-
dinate clauses (and even a subordinate clause within a clause). The subject of the sentence
is in line 9b (lumun šutti) and its verb is in line 11 (ayy-ikšudanni).
lā yattun šī kīma qanû annû naṭpū-ma
Line 8: MS A reads ana KI -šú but MS B reads ana ni-iṭ-pi-šú, “to its place of plucking.” KI
= ašru, “place.” Ana ašrīšu generally means “(to be restored) to its place.” NU = lā. GUR
( MS A’s reading) = iturru, a G preterite with subjunctive –u, from târu, “to turn, to return.”
MS B confirms this reading with i-tu-[ru . . . ]. The first partially readable line of the ritual
preceding the prayer mentions qan kiṣri, “a reed joint” (see Butler, 314, line 1). Unfortu-
nately, the associated verb is unclear. The kīma in this line begins a second ritual analogy.
TÚG . SÍG = sissiktu, “hem, fringe, edge.” See CAD S, 322–25 for the most common defini-
tions of sissiktu. Meir Mallul suggested that a sissiktu is “some type of loincloth or lap-
garment” (“‘Sissiktu’ and ‘sikku’ Cutting Off a sissiktu - Their Meaning and Function,” BiOr
43.1/2 [1986], 20–36, here 36). See the further discussion of sissiktu in the note on line 15
of Shamash 25, page 426. The impression of a sissiktu could serve in lieu of a seal (CAD S,
322–25). TÚG = ṣubātu, “garment.” Batāqu, “to cut off.” MS B preserves the expected sub-
junctive on the 3fs predicative verb (batqatu). This second ritual analogy may reflect the
cutting (batāqu) of a sissiktu as a symbolic act of divorce just as tying (rakāsu) a sissiktu was
a symbolic act of marriage (see CAD S, 322). The supplicant seeks to symbolically divorce
himself from any negative portent of his dream.
ana ašrīšu (var. niṭpīšu) lā iturru kīma sissiktu annītu ina ṣubātīya batqat(u)-ma
Line 9: MS A inserts the word ḫepî, “broken,” between TÚG and GIM , indicating that
there were unreadable signs in this place in the text (somewhere in the ancestry of MS A)
due to a broken or defaced tablet. Ḫepî is the common scribal method of indicating such a
break. MS B, however, reads TÚG -ia at this location. GIM = kīma, here means “because” or
the like and introduces a subordinate clause within the larger subordinate clause. Ibbatqu,
“it was torn,” is an N preterite of batāqu (with subjunctive). MS B varies, reading a G pret-
erite (with subjunctive): ibtuqu, “he tore (it).” The image of the torn hem reflects the ritual
requirement to “cut off (batāqu) the hem of the right side of his (garment)” in the ritual𒑆 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : N USKU 12

instructions immediately before the prayer (Butler, 314; Oppenheim, 289, 340). The last
few words of the line form the subject of the independent clause, upon which the preced-
ing lines (7b–9a) depend.
ana ṣubātīya kīma ibbatqū-ma lā iturru lumun šutti annīti
Line 10: Assuming that the end of this line is correctly restored, line 10 is identical to
line 3 plus the first word in line 4. As there, these words form a relative clause that further
defines the dream. This restatement together with the final plea provides a summary
statement of the long plea that precedes it. As such, it produces an emphasized sense of
urgency.
ša ina bararti qablīti šāt urri ibbablam-ma
Line 11: Ayy-ikšudanni is the main verb of the long sentence that started in line 7b. MS
A lacks this verb and instead understands the final clause of the line to be the main sen-
tence. According to MS A, everything preceding lā yattun šī all the way back to the kīma in
line 7b must be read as an anacoluthon. This final clause is identical to the first clause in
line 7, thereby framing (in MS B) the ritual analogies and final petition. Here the prayer
proper apparently ends. The rest of the ritual is rather broken (see the introduction to the
prayer above).

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In 1873, Sayce tentatively suggested that biblical Nisroch (‫נסרך‬, 2 Kgs 19:37
 Isa 37:38) might be none other than the god Nusku. Since then, this view has
come in and out of currency but has never gained permanent traction. At the
very best, the evidence is weak and dependent on unsupportable assumptions
about a number of modifications and/or errors in the way Hebrew scribes wrote
and preserved the name. These unsupportable assumptions render the suggestion
unlikely if not impossible. Uehlinger outlines the several problems with the sug-
gestion. 1
Nusku as the lamp that lights the darkness is not mentioned in this Akkadi-
an prayer, though the ritual implies this role for the deity. The prayer-hymn of
David in 2 Sam 22, especially ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫יהּ‬ ַ ‫גּ‬ ִ ַ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫יהֹו‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫יר‬ ִ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫ה‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫י־א‬
‫כּ‬ ִ , “You, O Yahweh, are
my lamp; Yahweh lights my darkness” (v 29), attributes a similar role to Yah-
weh.
One of the obvious elements of this Akkadian prayer is that the supplicant
does not know the meaning of his dream. In contrast is the story of Joseph in
1
A. H. Sayce, “Critical Examination of Isaiah xxxvi.–xxxix. on the Basis of Recent Assyrian Dis-
coveries,” Theological Review 10, issue 40 (1873), 15–31, here 27; note Christoph Uehlinger,
“Nisroch,” DDD, 630–32.186Gen 37 where both Joseph and his brothers know the meanings of his dreams
and know them without the aid of professional oneiromancy. One sees the same
with Daniel’s dreams. In general, biblical actors understand their dreams with-
out professional assistance. Among the very few exceptions are foreigners, Phar-
aoh and Nebuchadnezzar, for example. 2 This Nusku prayer and its ritual do not
appear to comprehend the possibility that a dream might be meaningless—a
possibility suggested by Job 20:8 and Isa 29:7–8. 3
Discussed more fully in connection with one of the prayers to Shamash, 4 the
role of the gods, particularly Shamash and Adad and less frequently Nusku, as
judges is important in several prayers. Compare the role of Yahweh as judge in
Gen 18:25, Job 21:22, Pss 7:9, 43:1, 50:6, 82:1, 3, 8, and elsewhere. The Akka-
dian stock phrase dīnī dīn, “judge my case,” in line 2, finds an extremely close
semantic equivalent in ‫י‬ ‫ט‬ ִ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ‫ט‬ ָ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ , “judge my case,” in Lam 3:59b.
Cutting off the hem of a garment as a metaphor for an act that cannot be
undone is reminiscent of David’s cutting off of Saul’s ‫יל‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫מּ‬ ַ ‫ף־ה‬
ַ‫נ‬ ‫כּ‬ ְ , “corner of the
cloak,” in 1 Sam 24:5, an act of humiliation. By tearing off the hem of his own
garment, our supplement humbles himself while at the same time provides a
symbol of the desire for a permanent “divorce,” or separation, from any evil
portent of his dream. Compare also 1 Sam 15:27, where Saul tears off Samuel’s
‫יל‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫מּ‬ ַ ‫ף־ה‬
ַ‫נ‬ ‫כּ‬ ְ as a symbol of the transfer of kingship.
The Biblical tradition does not share the concern expressed in the Nusku
prayer that a dream’s significance could be ambiguous. 5 The closest parallel to
this prayer within the extended Jewish tradition comes from the Babylonian
Talmud rather than the Hebrew Bible. Ber 55b 6 records a prayer containing simi-
lar themes to some of those found in our Nusku prayer.
Sovereign of the Universe, I am Thine and my dreams are Thine. I have dreamt a
dream and I do not know what it is. Whether I have dreamt about myself or my
companions have dreamt about me, or I have dreamt about others, if they are

In fact, biblical authors show a strong tendency to distrust diviners. In places there is great
concern that diviners might be the source of false prophecy. See Deut 13:2–6, where we see the
concern that, even if the portent comes true, such diviners may lead to the worship of other
gods. Deut 18:21–22 claims that an oracle that does not come true is a sure indication that it is
not from Yahweh.

Epstein’s translation. This parallel was first noted by Oppenheim, 299. Devorah Schoenfeld
discusses this prayer/ritual as evidence for an “incomplete transition” from a revelation to inter-
pretation based religion (see “Madness and Prophecy: Dreams, Texts, and the Power of Rabbinic
Interpretation,” Pastoral Psychology 56:2 [Nov, 2007], 223–35).𒑆 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : N USKU 12

good dreams, confirm them and reinforce them like the dreams of Joseph, and if
they require a remedy, heal them, as the waters of Marah were healed by Moses,
our teacher, and as Miriam was healed of her leprosy and Hezekiah of his sick-
ness, and the waters of Jericho by Elisha. As thou didst turn the curse of the
wicked Balaam into a blessing, so turn all my dreams into something good for
me. [References omitted]
The prayer is attributed to Amemar II (c. 400 CE ), Mar Zutra, or R. Ashi (most
likely Amemar). This prayer answered a challenge to tell something the other
members of the group might not know. Note the uncertainty as to the portent of
the reported dream in both the Talmudic prayer and our Nusku prayer. Both also
desire that the portent of their dreams be upheld if good but avoided if bad.

An Incantation-Prayer to the Cultic Agent Salt
J EFFREY S TACKERT
S ALT :
There is little evidence from ancient Mesopotamia for the deification of salt.
The ruler of the Middle Euphrates kingdom of Mari, Zimri-Lim, did erect a statue
to Ḫatta, the god of salt, 1 but it does not seem that such veneration of a salt god
was widespread or persistent. Salt was employed widely in the ancient Near East
for various utilitarian purposes (e.g., curing hides, preservation, flavor en-
hancement, and medicine). It was also a regular ingredient in ritual and magical
practices. 2 For example, by analogy to its use at the human table, Mesopotamian
texts describe the application of salt to animal and vegetable offerings. It is also
employed in incense offerings, various magical rites, and ritual curses. The anal-
ogies of Mesopotamian omen literature likewise reference salt. Among Hittite
rituals, perhaps the best known use of salt is one that parallels its use in Mesopo-
tamian curses: the First Hittite Soldier’s Oath employs salt within an analogical
curse ritual against that soldier who would commit sedition. 3
The ancient Near Eastern ritual applications for salt indicate that it carries
both positive and negative significances. It can symbolize health, purification,
and well-being, but it can also be associated with infertility, dissolution, and
destruction. Salt is also employed ritually across the gamut of social ranks.

It is oftentimes difficult to draw a meaningful distinction between medicine and magic. For
discussions of these categories and their relationship, see, e.g., Jean Bottéro, “Magic and Medi-
cine,” in Everyday Life in Ancient Mesopotamia (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001),
162–82; Walter Farber, “Witchcraft, Magic, and Divination in Ancient Mesopotamia,” CANE
3:1895–1909; Robert Biggs, “Medicine, Surgery, and Public Health in Ancient Mesopotamia,”
CANE 3:1911–24. See also JoAnn Scurlock’s discussion of medicaments (Magico-Medical Means of
Treating Ghost-Induced Illnesses in Ancient Mesopotamia [Ancient Magic and Divination 3; Leiden:
Brill/Styx, 2006], 67–71), as well as her texts nos. 60 and 191a for examples of the magico-
medical usage of salt in Mesopotamia.

189190T HE P RAYER :
The salt incantation-prayer appears in Tablet VI (lines 111–119) of the eight
tablet series known as Maqlû (“burning”). The canonical form of Maqlû dates
from the first millennium BCE and constitutes a complex ritual ceremony for
counteracting sorcery and effecting retribution against the witch(es) or war-
lock(s) who has (have) unjustly afflicted an innocent target. The salt incantation-
prayer is one of several incantations to be recited by a victim of black magic
and, according to the ritual tablet that accompanies the series, is to be attended
by a fumigation rite. 4 The prayer is characterized by a tripartite structure: hym-
nic introduction, petition, and promise of praise in response to divine assistance.
The first four lines comprise the hymnic introduction with stereotypical acclaim
of the addressee. Lines 5–8a comprise the entreaty to remove the witchcraft that
afflicts the speaker. Lines 8b–9 contain the concluding promise to praise salt
upon its successful intervention on the petitioner’s behalf.
Because it does not address a deity, the salt incantation-prayer is not a con-
ventional example of the shuilla. It instead belongs to a relatively small sub-
category of texts termed Kultmittelbeschwörungen or Kultmittelgebete (“incanta-
tions/prayers to a cultic agent”). 5 Much like shuillas directed to particular dei-
ties, incantation-prayers to cultic agents attempt to exploit specific characteris-
tics of their addressees to remedy the patient’s predicament.
The speaker’s predicament in the salt incantation-prayer appears to be two-
fold. What is obvious is that the supplicant suffers the ill effects of witchcraft.
Yet several factors suggest that the situation in this case is more complex. First,
this text’s promise of praise contains two significant features that point to a rich-
er religious conceptualization of the speaker’s predicament: (1) The speaker
draws an analogy between their action and the action taken toward “the god
who made me,” i.e., the personal god; and (2) The promise to praise employs the
iterative stem of the verb (lultammarki), a unique usage among the shuilla-type
incantation-prayers that address non-deified objects. Second, the progression of
ritual applications for salt envisioned in this incantation-prayer (flavor enhancer
for food offerings, incense additive, and finally fumigation additive) may reflect
a progression of ritual activities performed by the speaker to counteract misfor-
tune. This precise sequence is attested in Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 1–22. 6 This passage
in Ludlul explicitly describes divine abandonment and its effects, a recurrent
4
The ritual (Ritual Tablet [IX] 118–120) reads: šiptu attī ṭābtu ša ina ašri elli ibbanû / ana muḫḫi
kīrban ṭābti tamannū-ma / ina muḫḫi nignakki ša qutāri ša ina rēš mayyāli tašakkan, “The incanta-
tion ‘You are salt, the one made in a pure place’ you shall recite over a lump of salt and you shall
place (it) (i.e., the salt) in the fumigant burner that is at the head of the bed (i.e., of the pa-
tient).” See Meier’s edition (61).

topic in Maqlû (e.g., I 1–14). 7 Taken together, these factors suggest that the salt
incantation-prayer provides a remedy not only for the witchcraft that afflicts the
supplicant but also the abandonment of the personal god, a departure effected
by the afflicting spell. 8

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This term marks the beginning of
the prayer but is not part of its text. It is characteristic of ritual texts more broadly and is
thus not limited to prayers per se. Attī, “you” (fs). MUN = ṭābtu, “salt.” Ašru, “place.” KÙ =
ellu, “pure, clean.” Nabnû (N of banû), “to be built, to be made.” The form is a 3cs preterite
with subordination marker. Ša ina ašri elli ibbanû: this terminology parallels that used to
describe the production of divine images in Mesopotamia (see Christopher Walker and
Michael B. Dick, “The Induction of the Cult Image in Ancient Mesopotamia: The Mesopo-
tamian mīs pî Ritual,” in Born in Heaven, Made on Earth: The Making of the Cult Image in the
Ancient Near East, [ed. Michael B. Dick; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1999], 55–122).

Line 2: mākālû, “food, meal,” oftentimes used to characterize food offerings to deities.
= ilū, “gods.” GAL . MEŠ = rabûtu, “great.” The “great gods” can refer to the gods
in general or to the chief deities of the pantheon. In light of the parallelism with Ellil (=
d
EN . LÍL ), the lauditory tone of the invocation, and especially the banquet described in the
following line, the great gods here are likely the principle deities. Šâmu (šiāmu), “to ap-
point”. The 2fs accusative suffix on the verb refers to ṭābtu, “salt” in line 1. Among its
various usages, the verb šâmu may denote the assignment of roles and offices to deities,
including by Ellil (see CAD Š/I, 358–59). Ellil, “lord [of the] wind,” is the high god who
resides in the temple é-kur, “mountain house” (see line 3), in Nippur.
ana mākālê ilī rabûti išīmki Ellil
DINGIR . MEŠ
Line 3: Ina balī-X, “without X.” Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be set, to be established.”
Iššakkan is an N 3cs durative. Naptanu, “meal, (royal/cultic) banquet.” Naptan may be read
as the absolute form of the noun. Yet there seems to be little significance to the absence of
the case ending here. Maqlû II 9–10, which is a near verbatim parallel to lines 3–4 here,
attests two variants: naptanu and naptana. These examples suggest the possibility of read-
ing the TAN sign here as a CVCV sign (i.e., tana) rather than a CVC sign. Alternatively, the
case ending could simply be implied. It must also be noted that, as a first millennium As-
syrian text, such omission of the case vowel is hardly anomalous.
ina balīki ul iššakkan naptan ina E-kur
Line 4: LUGAL = šarru, “king.” IDIM = kabtu, “noble, influential person.” NUN = rubû,
“prince, nobleman.” The quartet of god, king, noble, and prince recurs in Mesopotamian
prayers and incantations as a formulaic expression to denote those to whom the speaker is
subordinate. Eṣēnu, “to smell.” Qutrinnu, “incense.” Incense offerings oftentimes appear
alongside food offerings. The claim of this line is also applied elsewhere to deities, again
underscoring the conceit of addressing the non-deity salt in a shuilla-type prayer.
ina balīki ilu šarru kabtu u rubû ul iṣṣinū qutrinnu
Line 5: This line begins with a standard self-introduction formula. The remainder of
line 5 through the end of line 6 constitutes a sort of complaint, informing the addressee of
the supplicant’s condition. Complaints frequently follow the self-introduction. NENNI =
annanna, “so and so.” Annanna serves as a place marker for the name and patronymic of
the petitioner who employs the stock prayer. A = māru, “son.” Kišpū, “sorcery, witchcraft.”
Ṣubbutu (D of ṣabātu), “to sieze.” Ṣubbutūʾinni is a D 3mp “active stative” (or “transitive
parsāku”; see Heuhnergard § 33.2) plus 1cs accusative suffix. It is formally identical to the
predicative construction. One might expect the accusative to be –ninni, but the form with-
out the initial n is often found in SB Akkadian (see GAG §84d and Verbalparadigma 12a,
n.6 on p. 11*). The alef placed after the verb and before the pronominal suffix convention-𒌋 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER TO THE C ULTIC A GENT S ALT

Line 6: Upšāšû (upšaššû), “magical intrigues, sorcery.” Laʾābu, “to afflict.” Leʾbūʾinni is
a G 3mp active stative or transitive parsāku construction plus 1cs accusative suffix. Line 6
is subordinate to the ša in line 5; thus, upšāšê leʾbūʾinni is in apposition to kišpī ṣubbutūʾinni.
upšāšê leʾbūʾinni
Line 7: BÚR = paṭāru, “to release, to loosen.” Puṭrī is a G fs impv. Puššuru (D of
pašāru), “to dispel, to disperse, to release.” Pušširī is a D fs impv. Ruḫû, “sorcery, witch-
craft.” The petition proper begins in this line. Note also that alongside the petition itself is
a renewed invocation of salt. The verbs paṭāru and pašāru are common in incantations
against sorcery and their accompanying rituals. As attested in the accompanying ritual to
this text, release is attempted in this case through the recitation of the salt incantation-
prayer as a part of a fumigation rite that features a lump of salt. In other instances in
Maqlû, the afflicted patient burns an effigy of the witch and warlock responsible for their
torment (e.g., I 135–143). In some cases, the incantation texts portray witchcraft as physi-
cally binding the patient, and various metaphors for release dramatize the victim’s libera-
tion. See, e.g., Maqlû V 51ff., 95–97, which characterize witchcraft as a binding to be bro-
ken, peeled like garlic, and released like a string.
puṭrī kišpīya ṭābtu pušširī ruḫêya
Line 8: Maḫāru, “to receive, take upon oneself.” Muḫrīnnī-ma is a G fs impv. plus 1cs
accusative suffix and enclitic –ma. GIM = kīma, “like, as.” Banû, “to build, make.” Bānīya is
a G ms participle (genitive case) with a 1cs possessive suffix. It is functioning attributively
in relation to ili, “god.” “The god who made me” is an epithet for the personal god. Other
similar epithets for the personal god include “the god who guards you” (ilu nāṣirka), “the
god who provides good health” (ilu mušallimu), and “the god at my side” (ila aḫīya). For
references to these different epithets, see CAD I/J, 100. For discussion of the personal god,
see page 431 in this book. Note that kīma ili bānīya should be read syntactically with the
verb in line 9.
upšāšê muḫrīnnī-ma kīma ili bānīya
Line 9: Šamāru, “to praise.” Lultammarki is a Gtn 1cs precative plus 2fs suffix (–št–
often becomes –lt– in SB Akkadian texts). Across literary genres, šamāru appears primarily
in the Gt stem, which has led to some debate over the productivity of the iterative stem for
this verb. Mayer, however, does take šamāru as Gtn here (UFBG, 323). It should also be
noted that the promise of praise that closes the shuilla-type incantation-prayer is at times
accompanied by modifiers such as ana dārâti “forever,” which is conceptually parallel to
the iterative aspect of the Akkadian –tan– stems. For examples of the uses of šamāru in the194closing formulae of Mesopotamian prayers, see UFBG, 323–24. For discussion of the clos-
ing promise in shuilla-prayers, see Abusch, “Promise to Praise” as well as his “Blessing and
Praise in Ancient Mesopotamian Incantations,” in Literatur, Politik und Recht in Mesopota-
mien: Festschrift für Claus Wilcke (ed. W. Sallaberger, K. Volk, and A. Zgoll; Orientalia Bibli-
ca et Christiana 14; Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003), 1–14.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Though there are no prayers addressed to cultic agents in the Hebrew Bible,
there are still important resonances between this prayer and religious phenome-
na from ancient Israel and Judah. The various uses for salt attested across the
ancient Near East correspond closely with those described in the Hebrew Bible.
For example, biblical texts reference salt as a flavor enhancer (Job 6:6, Ezra
4:14, 6:9) and medicine (Ezek 16:4). Priestly sacrificial rules require the applica-
tion of salt to food offerings presented to the deity (Lev 2:13, Num 18:19, Ezek
43:24). Salt is also added to biblical incense offerings (Exod 30:35), employed as
a healing agent in prophetic magic (2 Kgs 2:20–22), and dispersed as part of
cursing rituals (Deut 29:20–26). 1
The conceptualization of sacrifice as the food meant to solicit divine favor is
especially prominent in the opening address of this prayer. Within the Hebrew
Bible, a similar view obtains (see, e.g., Lev 3:11, 16; 21:6, 8, 17, 21, 22; 22:25;
Num 28:2, 24; Ezek 44:7, 16; Mal 1:6–12), although there is also some attempt
to rebut this conception of sacrifice (e.g., Ps 50:12–13). In the case of Ps 50, by
offering a polemic against sacrifice as divine food, the psalmist reinforces the
normative status of this understanding. 2
1
The relation between salt and curse—and by extension, salt and covenant—has been explored
extensively within biblical studies. See, e.g., F. Charles Fensham, “Salt as Curse in the Old Tes-
tament and the Ancient Near East,” BA 25 (1962), 48–50; H. Eising, “   ,” TDOT 8:331–33 (at
333). For broader connections between salt and covenant and especially sacrificial aspects, see
Baruch A. Levine, Leviticus (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of
America, 1989), 13; Idem, Numbers 1–20 (AB 4; New York: Doubleday, 1993), 449; and Jacob
Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16 (AB 3; New York: Doubleday, 1991), 191–92.

alia, W. G. Lambert, “Donations of Food and Drink to the Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia,” in

The conception of the personal god as the individual’s creator finds a close
parallel in biblical texts such as Isa 44:2 ( ָ‫ךּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ע‬ ְ ַ‫י‬ ‫ן‬ ‫ט‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ֶ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ָך‬ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫ֹצ‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ָך‬ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ֶ ‫ע‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ , “the L ORD ,
your maker and creator, who has helped you from the womb”), Prov 14:31 ( ‫ק‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֵ ‫ע‬
‫ֺן‬ ‫יו‬ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫ן‬ ֵ‫חֹנ‬ ‫דוֹ‬ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫וּמ‬

but he who is gracious to the needy honors him”; see Prov 17:5), and Job 35:10
( ‫ה‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ְ‫י‬ ָ‫לּ‬ ‫בּ‬ ַ ‫רוֹת‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ן‬ ‫ֹת‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ ‫י‬ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ָ ‫ע‬ ‫לוֹהּ‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ֵ‫יּ‬ ‫א‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ֹא‬ ‫ל‬ ְ‫ו‬ , “But no one says, ‘Where is God, my maker,
the one who gives songs in the night?’”). The Second Isaiah text cited here is
also noteworthy because it applies the intimate epithets of the personal god,
with singular possessives, to the collective exilic community (see also Isa 45:9,
11; 46:4; 51:13; Hos 8:4; Ps 95:6; 149:2).
As for the promise of praise, texts such as Ps 44:9, 115:18, 119:64, and
145:2 emphasize iterative praise of the deity akin to the promise in this prayer.

A Ritual and Incantation-Prayer
against Ghost-Induced Illness: Shamash 73
D UANE S MITH
S HAMASH :
For the ancient Mesopotamians, Shamash (Akk.) or Utu (Sum.) was the dei-
fied sun. 1 He brought light and warmth to the world and its inhabitants during
the day. It was in this capacity that Shamash brought life to the world and
caused plants to grow. At night, he surveyed the underworld. While the serrated
blade, sometimes called a saw, commonly appears in depictions of Shamash, the
winged solar disk is his most common iconographic symbol. 2 His anthropo-
morphic image is that of a bearded old man, sometimes seated, often with solar
rays emanating from his shoulders and holding a scepter and/or his serrated
blade. 3 His divine number is 20. Shamash, the twin brother of the goddess Ishtar
(Inana), was the son of Sin (Nanna). His mother is Ningal and his consort is Aya.
1
It is often difficult to conceptualize the relationship between the nature of the astrological gods
as divine beings and their nature as the celestial bodies with which the ancients identified them.
For many of them, including Shamash, this conceptual difficulty extends to them having an
anthropomorphic representation while at the same time being associated with a celestial body.
On these difficulties see JoAnn Scurlock, Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-induced Illnesses
in Ancient Mesopotamia (Ancient Magic and Divination 3; Leiden: Brill, 2006), 77 and her several
references. The prayer discussed here well illustrates this point in lines 21–25 as does line 3 of
Shamash 1 (see page 370).

potamian Gods,” 120, 124–29, and Barbara Nevling Porter, ed. What Is a God? Anthropomorphic

Assyriological Institute 2; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2009), 3, passim.
197198Archaeologists have uncovered temples for Shamash at Sippar and at Larsa, both
named É-babbar, “shining house.” He also shared a temple with Sin at Ashur.
While the importance of Utu/Shamash waxed and waned over time, 4 Sumerian
and Akkadian texts give witness to his worship from the earliest times until late
in the history of Mesopotamia.
Because Shamash could survey the earth by day and the underworld by
night—and therefore nothing could remain hidden from him, he was revered as
the god of truth and justice, who corrected injustice and mitigated the portents
of evil omens. 5 In the epilogue of the Code of Hammurabi, for example, Shamash
is called dayyānim rabîm ša šamê u erṣetim (xxiv 85–86), “the great judge of
heaven and earth.” The bas-relief on the upper part of the Code’s stele depicts
Hammurabi before Shamash. The attribution of law and justice to Shamash ap-
peared long before Hammurabi. The epilogue to the Laws of Lipit-Ishtar, c. 1939
BCE , reads in part, “in accordance with the true word of the god Utu, I made the
lands of Sumer and Akkad hold fair judicial procedure.” 6
Ancient texts compare the kings Ur-Nammu, Amar-Sin, Lipit-Ishtar, Ham-
murabi, and Zimri-Lim to Utu/Shamash. 7 He was the protector of several heroes
including Gilgamesh. 8 More than many other gods, Shamash involved himself
positively in the affairs of humans, in which he seemed to have considerable
interest.

by an eṭemmu (“ghost”), an evil alû-demon, or a mukīl rēš lemutti-demon. The
text, at the highest level, has the structure of a conditional instruction. The ritual
functions as an extended apodosis addressing the condition in the brief protasis.
The ritual includes various ritual preparations and a performance of two incan-
tation-prayers, one by an āšipu, “exorcist,” and the other, Shamash 73, by the
marṣu, “diseased person, patient.” Although the second prayer is our focus, the
full ritual instructions are included here.
The conditional instruction structure is a common feature of most Mesopo-
tamian “magico-medical” texts. 10 As with many other ancient Mesopotamian
rituals designed to treat ghost-induced diseases, this ritual seeks to transfer the
offending ghost from the infected person to a specially prepared figurine and
then to bury that figurine along with the ghost it now embodies in an appropri-
ate place.
The ritual begins by providing rather specific instructions to the practitioner
who is addressed in the second person: “you gather. . . .” Nowhere does the text
clearly provide a title for this second person practitioner. Line 11 introduces an
āšipu in the third person: “He places. . . .” This āšipu performs a short but poign-
ant incantation. In line 17, the text returns to the second person, “you set up,”
and provides further instructions, presumably to the practitioner of the first six-
teen lines. Is the practitioner that the text addresses in the second person also
the third person āšipu of lines 11–16? It is not possible to be certain. JoAnn
Scurlock argues that they are the same person. Texts of this broad type that
specify the participants generally mention only an āšipu and a marṣu. 11 However,
three related texts indicate the participation of āšipu and asû, “physician,” as
practitioners in rituals intended to cure a person of a ghost-induced disease. If
there is only one practitioner in our text, the shift from second person to third
person and back to second person may indicate that the text is composite. As we
will see, there are other possible indications that this ritual was stitched together
from various loosely-related or previously-unrelated sources.
The conditional instruction begins with a protasis listing illness sources for
which the following ritual, the apodosis or the instruction, is prescribed. The
practitioner is to construct a figurine and outfit it with various attire and provi-
sions. This figurine is placed on the roof of the patient’s house and libated with a
mixture of grain flour mixed into water and beer. Slivers of cedar and a magic
new tablet provides an important duplicate to the ritual instructions. Reference to these witness-
es will be noted occasionally as seems necessary.

“Magico-medical” is adopted from Scurlock’s Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-Induced
Illnesses in Ancient Mesopotamia, in which she studies over three hundred texts dealing with vari-
ous ghost-induced illnesses.
11
JoAnn Scurlock, “Physician, Exorcist, Conjurer, Magician: The Tale of Two Healing Profes-
sions,” in Mesopotamian Magic: Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspectives (ed. Tzvi Abusch
and Karel van der Toorn; Ancient Magic and Divination 1; Groningen: Styx, 1999), 69–79, here
more specifically 70–71 and 75.200circle are placed around it. The practitioner then covers the figurine with an
unfired fermenting vat. For three days and nights, the covered figurine is to be
left outdoors while an exorcist (āšipu) places loaves and juniper censers by day
(ana pāni Šamaš) and pours out emmer flour by night (ana pāni kakkabī mūšītim).
Day and night, the exorcist recites a short incantation directed at the ghost. In
the evening of the third day, the practitioner must prepare a ritual before Sha-
mash. The patient then raises the figurine and recites the incantation that is the
principle subject of this treatment. Following this incantation, the practitioner
must place the figurine in a pot and bind it by an oath. The ritual ends with the
instructions to “bury it in abandoned wastelands.”
Under the guidance and instruction of the practitioner (kīam tušadbabšu,
“you shall make him recite as follows”), the patient recites the longest incanta-
tion-prayer of the ritual, Shamash 73. One of the textual witnesses to the prayer
lacks any associated ritual (Scurlock’s MS C). The existence of this tablet suggests
that the prayer circulated independently of the ghost ritual. For this reason, it is
possible that a compiler simply plugged the prayer into the ritual. This may ac-
count for the apparent differences between the description of the disease in the
protasis of the ritual (“ghost,” “an evil alû-demon or a mukīl rēš lemutti-demon”)
and the description in lines 29 and 30 of the prayer (“an utukku-demon, a rābiṣu
demon, a ghost, a lilû-demon, paralysis, dizziness, numbness of the flesh, vertigo,
stiffness, [and] confusion”). Only eṭemmu, “ghost,” is common between them.
The structure of the prayer is as follows:
I) Invocation
A) The god’s name and honorific titles (19–22)
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (23–27a)
II) Petition
A) Self-introduction (27b)
B) Acknowledgement of reverential stance vis-a-vis the god (27c)
C) Lament (28–30)
D) Plea (31–34a)
III) Conditional call for agreement and rejoicing (34b–35)
The invocation first calls on Shamash by name and by several of his honorif-
ic titles. These highlight his role among the gods and among people. It then
praises his various talents. He is judge, bringer of light and warmth to all hu-
mankind and even to the animals. The invocation takes up the important theme
of judge a second time. Here the supplicant reminds Shamash that he makes
right the verdicts of the wronged man and woman. The invocation thus sets the
stage for the petition. The petition itself begins with a common formulaic self-
introduction that leads directly to a lament in which the supplicant recounts
their condition: exhausted and bound (iʾiltu iʾʾilanni, “a binding has bound me”)
by an angry god or goddess. Here, with reference to ritual behavior, the suppli-
cant indicates that they are standing before Shamash. The prayer unfolds the
details of how they are bound. At this point, the plea, returning to the theme of
Shamash as judge, calls on Shamash to render a verdict in the supplicant’s case𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 201
and to do it without delay. Referring back to binding, the prayer asks that Sha-
mash not take up any other case until the supplicant’s binding (iʾiltī, “my bind-
ing”) is released. With the repetition of similar language, the prayer closely ties
the lament and plea together. The prayer ends by calling on the gods to agree
with Shamash’s verdict and for both the heavens and the earth to celebrate his
granting of the supplicant’s plea.

ḪUL DAB -[su]
Line 1: DIŠ = šumma, “if.” NA = amīlu (awīlum), “man.” Magico-medical texts often
open with the words šumma amīlu. Amīlu is the antecedent to the pronominal suffix on the
verb (–šu). GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost.” See JoAnn Scurlock and Burton R. Andersen, Diagno-
ses in Assyrian and Babylonian Medicine: Ancient Sources, Translations, and Modern Medical
Analyses (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2005), 436–37, 441, 455–56 on eṭemmu as a
disease symptom. DAB = ṣabātu, “seize, take hold.” Note that –tš– (the last radical of the
root and the first letter of the pronominal suffix) becomes –ss–. The –ma serves here as a
conjunctive particle. UŠ = redû, “to accompany, pursue” In this case the MEŠ indicates an
iterative form of the verb, the Gtn: riteddû, “to pursue, to chase constantly.” Lū . . . lū,
“either . . . or.” A . LÁ = alû, a kind of demon. ḪUL = lemnu, “evil,” is an adj. that modifies
alû. The reconstruction of the last three words of the line follows the new duplicate
Sm.1118.

Line 2: SAG .< ḪUL >. ḪA . ZA = sagḫulḫazû-demon or mukīl rēš lemutti-demon. Scurlock,
based on syllabic spellings, prefers the latter reading (533). Mimma, “anything, something,
everything.” SU = zumru, “body.” ZI = nasāḫu, “to remove, to expel.” The last four words
again follow Sm.1118. The infinitive at the end of the line provides the purpose of the
ritual: to remove (all the evil) from his body. See lines 14 and 16 below.
lū mukīl rēš lemutti iṣbassu lū mimma lemnu iṣbassu ina zumrīšu nasāḫi
Line 3: SAḪAR = eperu, “dust, earth, soil.” URU = ālu, “city.” ŠUB = nadû, “abandoned,
deserted.” Note the phonetic complement –i indicating the adj., nadî; therefore, the phrase
āli nadî is in the genitive and eper, from eperu, must be a bound form. This structure con-
tinues throughout this line and the beginning of the next. É = bītu, “house.” É DINGIR = bīt
ili, “house of a god, temple.” KI . MAḪ = kima(ḫ)ḫu (kimāḫu), “tomb,” a Sumerian loanword.
KIŠI 8 = kulbābu, “ant.” “Dust of an ant” is probably to be rendered “dust from anthill” (see
CAD K, 502). The last word is attested clearly on Sm.1118.
eper āli nadî eper bīti nadî eper bīt ili nadî eper kimaḫi nadî eper kulbābi
Line 4: ÍD = nāru, “river, canal.” “Canal” is preferable here because the other sources
of dust from abandoned places are man-made. KASKAL = ḫarrānu, “road.” 1 -niš = ištēniš,
“together.” TI = leqû, “to gather, to obtain, to take something in hand.” KI = itti, “with.”
ÚŠ = dāmu, “blood.” GU 4 = alpu, “bull, ox.” ḪE . ḪE = bullulu (D of balālu), “to mix (up).” NU
= ṣalmu, “figurine, image.” DÙ = epēšu, “to make, to build.” Were it not for the phonetic
complement, one might be tempted to read DÙ as banû, perhaps the more common verb in
these contexts. See CAD B, 86–87.
eper nāri nadīti eper ḫarrāni ištēniš teleqqe itti dām alpi tuballal ṣalam mimma lemnu tep-
puš
Line 5: KUŠ = mašku, “skin.” UR . MAḪ = nēšu, “lion.” A variant reads alpu, “bull,” here
instead. MU 4 . MU 4 = lubbušu (D of labāšu), “to provide with clothing.” Note that –šš– (the
last radical of the root and the first letter of the 3ms pronominal suffix) becomes –ss–.
NA 4 . GUG = sāmtu, “carnelian, (red stone).” È = šakāku, “to string, to thread.” The context
requires that ina be understood as “around,” within the semantic range of “on” in such
contexts. GÚ = kišādu, “neck.” GAR = šakānu, “to put, to place.” KUŠ . A . GÁ . LÁ = narūqu,
“bag,” perhaps “leather bag” (see CAD N/1, 379, AH W , 749). The typical contents of a
narūqu are dry goods, flour, barley, bread, textiles, hides, or the like. A variant reads
KUŠ . A . EDIN . LÁ = nādu, “waterskin,” here. While nādu often denotes a “waterskin,” it too
means leather bag in some contexts (see CAD N/1, 100, AH W , 702). ZÌ . KASKAL = ṣidītu, “(tra-𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 203

the image with water and food.
mašak nēši tulabbassu sāmta tašakkak ina kišādīšu tašakkan narūqa ṣidīssu
Line 6: Ṣudû, “rations, provisions.” SUM = nadānu, “to give.” UD = ūmu, “day.” As a
determiniative, KÁM , generally follows an ordinal number. Therefore, UD . N . KÁM , generally
means “the Nth day.” But here, as in some other cases, it surely means “for N days.” Per-
haps we should read UD . 3 . KÁM here as šalāš umī. Notice that UD . 3 . KÁM is not preceded by
ina nor is there an indication of the plural (compare the expression in lines 11 and 17). ŠUK
= kurummatu, “food ration,” was often barley or flour. ÚTUL = diqāru, “serving bowl.” On
ṣerpētu (ṣirpētu), see CAD Ṣ, 208: “a dish made with barley and milk or fat.” IGI = pānu
“front, face (pl).” Ana pānīšu means “before/in front of him (or it).”

Line 7: ÙR = ūru, “roof.” LÚ . GIG = marṣu, “sick person, patient.” GUB = šuzuzzu (Š of
i/uzuzzu), “to make stand, to set up.” Tušazzassu is a 2ms Š durative (tušazzaz) plus a 3ms
pronominal suffix (–šu). The –zš– cluster becomes –ss–. The –ma, both here and later in this
line, is conjunctive, “and then.” ZÌ = qēmu, “flour.” ŠE . SA . A = qalītu or labtu, “parched
grain” (on labtu, see CDA, 175). The use of flour from parched grain is part of various
rituals; see CAD Q, 59 for other examples. A = mû, “water.” KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” SÌG =
maḫāṣu, “to beat, to weave” here “to stir.” BAL = naqû, “to pour as a libation.”

Line 8: GIŠ . EREN . NA = erēnu, “cedar.” Siltu, “sliver, chip (of wood).” Itû, “boundary.”
Itâtīšu is the fp with a 3ms pronominal suffix; it literally means “its boundaries” but is
being used here as a preposition (see CDA, 137), “all around it.” Zuqqupu (D of zaqāpu),
“to plant, to erect.”
3 siltī erēni itâtīšu tuzaqqap
Line 9: Zisurrû, “magic circle;” such magic circles were often made with (barley)
flour. See CAD Z, 138. NIGIN = lamû (lawûm), “to encircle.” DUG . NÍG . DÚR . BÙR = namzītu,
“fermenting vat.” NU = lā, “not.” AL . ŠEG 6 . GÁ should be read ṣarpu when used with earthen-
ware, “refined, fired,” as does CAD Ṣ, 113. It is not as likely to be read bašlu, “cooked,
heat-treated,” which tends not to be used with earthenware.

a Sumerogram complex for “his day,” Akk., ūmīšu. The pronoun likely refers to Shamash.

nakku, “censer.” The reading of 23 loaves and one censer follows Sm.1118. Scurlock’s MS A
does not mention loaves, as she reads it, but requires 22 censers to be set up ( 22
NÍG . NA . NÍG . NA = 22 nignakkū; note that the duplication of the logogram must be taken as an
indication of the plural). ŠIM . LI = burāšu, “juniper tree.” Note the change in subject to

this change in person indicate?

Line 12: ÁŠ . A . AN or ZÍZ . ÀM (as Scurlock reads it) = kunāšu, “emmer.” GE 6 -tim =
mūšītim, gen. “of night-time.” DUB = sarāqu, “to strew, to sprinkle.”
ina mūši qēm kunāši ana pāni kakkabī mūšītim isarraq
Line 13: Here ana pāni Šamaš u kakkabī means “day and night” but divine connota-
tions should not be discounted. Ana muḫḫi here means “over (it),” with the “it,” referring
to the figurine’s ritual arrangement, implied. Mitannû (Gtn of manû), “to count repeatedly,
to recite repeatedly.” On the reading of the verb as imtanannu (3cs Gtn durative), see Scur-
lock, 533.
ana pāni Šamaš u kakkabī UD . 3 . KÁM ana muḫḫi imtanannu
Line 14: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, spell, ritual wording.” This indicates to the user of
the tablet that the instructions turn now to what he should recite. This first incantation is
very brief, making it easy to recite repeatedly as prescribed in line 13. Ištu, “from.” Annî,
“this” (gen.). NENNI A NENNI = annanna mar annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so,” is a
common placeholder for the actual name of the supplicant in prayers. Sometimes an even
longer identification formula including the name of a personal god and goddess is used.
See also lines 27 below. ZI = nasāḫu, see line 2; the form is a 2ms predicative (as is the
next three verbs). Šūṣû (Š of [w]aṣû), “to make go out, to dismiss, to expel.”

Line 15: Ṭarādu, “to send away, to drive away.” Kuššudu (D of kašādu), “to drive
away, to chase off.” Šākikka is a ms participle (šākin) with a 2ms pronominal object suffix
(–ka). The n of the root assimilates to the following consonant. The same is true in the
fem. participle in the following line.
ṭardāta u kuššudāta ilu šākikka
Line 16: d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” d 15 is often used in parallel with ilu (see CAD I/J,
272). GIG = marṣu, “sick person, patient.” Issuḫūka is a 3mp G preterite (with 2ms pronom-
inal suffix) from nasāḫu (see line 2 and 14). This is the last line of the first incantation.

sents a noun in the accusative, riksa, “ritual arrangement.” On contextual and syntactical
grounds, the second instance of KEŠDA must be the verb tarakkas from rakāsu, “to bind, to
prepare, to set up.” The noun and the verb have the same root and appear together in
similar phrases. See CAD R, 351. Notice the return to the second person, indicated more
explicitly in line 18.

Line 18: ÍL = našû, “to raise.” Šudbubu (Š of dabābu), “to make someone speak, to
make someone recite aloud.” Expressions like this are common ritual instructions for pray-
ers. See, e.g., ṣalma šuātu tanaššī-ma kīam taqabbi, “you lift up that image and say this,”
cited in CAD N/2, 83.
marṣu ṣalma inaššī-ma ana pāni Šamaš kīam tušadbabšu
Line 19: The second incantation, Shamash 73, begins here. As is expected, the suppli-
cant’s prayer begins with an invocation and hymnic praise. Muttallu (muttellu), “princely,
noble.” Anunnakkū is a collective name from Sumerian that likely originally specified all
the gods of the pantheon but later, and particularly in Akkadian contexts, may only refer
to gods of earth and the underworld (See Black and Green, 34). Etellu, “pre-eminent, lord.”
On the connotation of etellu as applied to the younger gods, see CAD E, 383. Igigî refers to
the lesser gods of the pantheon. Massû, “leader, expert.” Ṣīru, “first rank, supreme, out-
standing.” Muttarrû, “leader, guide,” has the form of a Gtn participle from arû (see CAD
A/2, 314). Despite the nom. case ending, the word is bound to the following noun in the
gen. Tenēšētu (pl), “people, humankind.”

Line 20: Dayyānu, “judge.” AN = šamû, “heaven.” KI = erṣetu, “earth.” Dayyān šamê u
erṣetim is a very common and old epithet for Shamash. This epithet is particularly poignant
as part of this prayer. It is echoed in line 31, part of the petition, Šamaš dayyānu attā. In
lines 31–33 the supplicant prays for an immediate “verdict” in his case. Enû, “to change, to
shift, to revoke.” The negated infinitive describes a quality of Shamash. Qibītu, “speech,
command.” Qibītuššu includes the locative-adverbial ending –um plus the 3ms pronominal
suffix (–šu). The m assimilates to the š of the suffix. Although we may expect qibīssu here
(as a variant suggests), the locative-adverbial ending does stand sometimes in place of the
accusative (see GAG §66f).
dayyān šamê u erṣeti lā enû qibītuššu
Line 21: Muštēšir is a Št lex. participle (ms) from ešēru, “to cause to straighten, to put
in order.” Ekletu, “darkness.” The idea here is that Shamash puts the darkness in order. See
CAD N/2, 349. Šākin from šakānu is a G participle. Nūru, “light.” Nišū, “people.”
Šamaš muštēšir ekleti šākin nūri ana nišī
Line 22: Erēbu, “to enter,” but with reference to the sun, “to set.” The pronominal suf-
fix becomes the subject of the infinitive’s action: “in your setting.” ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.”
Uteṭṭû (Dt of eṭû), “to be darkened.” Aṣû (waṣûm), “to go out,” but with reference to the
sun, “to rise.” Namāru (nawārum), “to be(come) bright, to shine.” Kibrātu, “the regions,”
specifically the four regions of the earth, the four edges or shores, that is, the whole world.
Šamaš ina erēbīka nūr nišī ūtaṭṭi Šamaš ina aṣîka inammirā kibrāti
Line 23: Ekû (m), ekūtu (f), “impoverished, orphaned.” Almattu, “widow.” Here and
elsewhere in this text, the mimation is archaic and almost certainly aphonemic and likely
aphonetic in which case the signs should perhaps be read tu 4 or tì, as appropriate. The
reason for reading these signs tum and tim is that elsewhere in the text the signs TU and TI
are used for tu and ti. On kigullatu, “waif(?),” see AHw, 474 and CAD K, 349–50. Ruttu
(rūtu), “female associate, companion.” This line serves to indicate that the kala abrātu in
the next line includes even the most disenfranchised elements of humanity.
ekūtu almattu kigullatu u ruttu
Line 24: Ṣītu, “exit,” but with regard to the sun, “rising.” Šutaḫḫunu (Dt of šaḫānu),
“to be warmed up.” The form is a 3fp durative. Kala, “all.” Abrātu, “humankind” appears
only in the pl. See CAD A/1, 62.

Line 25: Būlu, “beasts,” and ašû, “animals,” are common synonyms. See CAD Ṣ, 114.
= napištu. Šiknat napišti are “living creatures,” an idiom based on šakānu, “to place, to
put,” and napištu, “life, vitality.” See CAD Š/2, 436. Ṣēru, “steppe, open country.”

Line 26: Ittabbulu (Gtn of [w]abālu), “to carry constantly, to bring constantly.” The
form is a 3fp durative plus a 2ms pronominal suffix. Napšāssina is the fp of napištu with a
3fp pronominal suffix. But the word could be read differently. For example, Seux (426),
following AHw, 698, reads nablāṭsina from nablāṭu, “healing, life giving.” The final word,
meš-re-ta, is also ambiguous. Is it a variant of mašrītu, “riches” (AHw, 629), as adopted by
Seux (427) and Foster (731), or is it mešrêtu, “limbs,” as Scurlock (535) and von Soden
(323) suggest? Should we understand this as a reference to sacrifice?
ittanabbalāka napšassina mešrêta
Line 27: The two halves of this double line straddle the hymnic introduction and the
petition section of the prayer, thereby providing a transition between the sections. The line
begins by calling on Shamash in his role as judge, a role that is directly applicable to the
petition. It recalls Shamash’s epithet as dayyān šamê u erṣetim in line 20. The first part of
this line summarizes the previous lines of the petition. It then identifies the petitioner via a
standard self-introduction formula. Dīnu, “case, judgment.” Ḫablu (m), ḫabiltu (f),
“wronged person.” While it is possible to understand ḫablu as “oppressed,” “wronged”
seems to work better in the context of this prayer. Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” EŠ . BAR =
purussû, “verdict, decision.” Purussû is commonly used in the context of verdicts from the
gods. Given the medical context of this prayer, we might call the god’s verdict a prognosis;
but for the Mesopotamian, a god’s decision, even with regard to an illness, is ultimately
legal in nature. Šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to put in order, to clear up, to provide justice.”
The form is 2ms durative. Šūnuḫu, “exhausted, troubled.” The adjective is used substanti-
vally here, “the exhausted one.” This is the first hint of a complaint in the prayer. A string
of complaints follows in lines 28–30. Kamāsu, “to kneel.” The form is 1cs predicative.
dīn ḫablim u ḫabilti tadân purussêšina tušteššir
anāku annanna mar annanna šūnuḫu kamsāku
Line 28: Šibšātu, “anger, angry rejection.” Ina must mean something like “on account
of” or “by.” Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, obligation, liability, sin.” Eʾēlu, “to bind.” Iʾʾilanni is a G
3cs durative with a 1cs pronominal object suffix. The ša introduces a relative clause that
describes the condition of the supplicant. They are bound due to divine anger, which may
be the result of some ritual failure but it need not be. Notice the alliteration in this line.

Line 29: UDUG = utukku, “demon, ghost.” MAŠKIM = rābiṣu, “demonic guardian,” see
CAD R, 23. GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost.” (As a symptom of one or more diseases, see Scurlock
and Andersen, Diagnoses, 436–37, 441, 455–56; eṭemmu can also be the cause of disease,
see CAD E, 397.) LÍL . LÁ = lilû, a kind of demon (see CAD L, 190 and Scurlock and Ander-
sen, Diagnoses, 434–36). Concerning ḫimītu (ḫimittu), dimītu, šimmat šīri (= UZU ), and
ṣīdānu: the several differing attempts listed here to provide definitions for these words
illustrate the considerable uncertainty about their meanings. (“Scurlock” in the list refers
to her edition of the text.)

translation will be tentative.

Line 30: Šaššaṭu, “stiff joints.” Following CAD Ṣ, 171, Seux translates šaššaṭu as
“L’arthrite” (427); Scurlock does not translate it at all (535). Scurlock and Andersen sug-
gest that this symptom is best understood by the modern term “tetanus” (Diagnoses, 66–
68). See also CAD Š/2, 175: [šumma kišāssu?] qablāšu ašṭa šaššaṭa MU . NI , “[If his neck?]
(and) hips are stiff, it is called šaššaṭu” (citing BAM 129 iv 3). Miqittu, “attack.” Ṭēmu here
means “reason” or the like. Miqit ṭēmi is “an attack on reason.” Šaqālu, “to weigh, to bal-
ance.” Išqulūnim-ma is a G 3mp preterite with a 1cs dative pronominal suffix and an enclit-
ic –ma. In this line we see two different uses of the enclitic –ma. On the verb (išqulūnim-
ma), the –ma functions as a conjunction, binding this sentence with the next. UD = ūmu,
“day.” Ūmišam-ma, “daily,” from ūmi plus –išam and the enclitic –ma. The –išam suffix
often forms distributive adverbs from nouns (see GAG §67g): “day” becomes “daily.” Here
the –ma brings special emphasis to the adverb ūmišam. The reading of the final verb is
uncertain (Scurlock’s MS B has ú-dam-ma-mu-[. . .). Attempts to derive the verb from
damāmu, damû, or ṭamû all flounder on morphological and/or contextual grounds. (The
capital D’s in the transliteration indicate uncertainty about the value of the dental conso-
nant. Should we read uṭ-ṭam- or ud-dam-?) A scribal error cannot be ruled out.

Line 31: The line comprises three clauses. The first clause is verbless and conveys the
supplicant’s confidence in Shamash’s judicial role. DI . KUD = dayyānu. Note that line 20
spells dayyānu syllabically, da-a-a-an, while here the text uses a logogram. Attā, “you”
(ms). The second clause illustrates the supplicant’s confidence through action. (W)abālu,
“to carry, to bring.” Ublakka is the G 1cs preterite (ubil) with a ventive (–am) and a 2ms
pronominal suffix (–ka). The m of the ventive has assimilated to the k of the pronominal
suffix (–mk– becomes –kk–). The verb is performative. By speaking it the supplicant per-
forms the implied action (i.e., saying that he brings his life to Shamash actually brings his
life to Shamash). The final clause is more complex. The first dīnu in the line must mean
“case, issue” or the like; the second means “judgment, verdict, prognosis.” GIG = murṣu,
“sickness, disease.” (This reading follows MS C, see also Seux, 427, n.22; MS A reads LÚ . GIG
= marṣu, “patient, sick person.”) The relative clause that follows murṣu defines the sick-
ness further via the verb iṣbatanni. The supplicant is kneeling submissively, the line says,
waiting for the deity to render a verdict about the case of disease that has seized him.
Šamaš dayyānu attā-ma napištī ublakka dīnu murṣi ša iṣbatanni ana dīni kamsāku
Line 32: Dīn is a ms impv. from dânu (see line 27) with a cognate accusative (dīnu).
The phonetic compliment on EŠ . BAR (-a-a) indicates that purussû ends in a long a. KUD =
parāsu, “to cut,” but with purussû it means “to render a decision or verdict.” Adi, “until,”
begins a temporal clause. Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause someone or something to acquire
something.” Tušaršû is a 2ms preterite with subjunctive (–u).
dīnu dīn purussâ purus adi dīnī purussâ tušaršû
Line 33: The text follows Seux in the reading of the first lacuna (see 427, n.23). The
restoration of the second lacuna follows Scurlock (532). Šanû, “another.” SUM = nadānu,
“to give, to deliver.” The construction lā tanaddin is a prohibitive, a negative impv. (“do
not”). The object of the verb follows it. A temporal clause, parallel to the one in line 32,
begins with the word ištu and introduces the prayer’s concluding section of praise. The
basic meanings of the preposition ištu are “from, since;” here it means “after.” (Note that
MS A reads the earlier form, ištu, while MS C reads ultu, the later form.) The verb in the
clause, tušteršû (for tuštaršû), is a 2ms perfect with subjunctive from šuršû (see line 32).
ana dīni šanîm-ma lā tanaddin purussâšu ištu dīnī purussâ tušteršû
Line 34: On eʾiltu (iʾiltu), see line 28. This word is the subject of the following two
verbs. (W)uššuru (D of [w]ašāru), “to release, to set free.” Although no subjunctive marker
is present (due to the object suffix), this verb is part of the subordinate clause from the
previous line (beginning with ištu). SU . MU = zumrī, zumru plus 1cs pronominal suffix (Sum.
MU = –ia 5 ). Naprušu (N, no G stem), “to fly”; in a simile “to flee.” The form is a 3cs perfect21035. [ AN -u liḫ]-du-ka

with subjunctive, indicating that this verb also continues the subordinate clause. Ēm(a),
“wherever.” Takālu, “to trust.” Mitguru (Gt of magāru), “to agree with one another, to come
to an agreement.” Pūka, “your mouth, your word.” We expect pī– before a pronominal
suffix, but pū– does occur in literature (see Scurlock, 533, citing AHw, 872). The Gt of
magāru is reciprocal and thus does not take an object. Pūka therefore must be taken adver-
bially, “(with regard to) your word.” Many translators suspect an error at the end of this
line, emending it to read likrubūka, “may they bless you” (see Foster, 731, Seux, 427, n.26,
and implied by von Soden, 324).
iʾiltī ūtašširanni ina zumrīya ittaprašu ēma taklāku ilū limtagrū pūku
Line 35: Ḫadû, “to be joyful.” Râšu (riāšum), “to rejoice.” TU 6 ÉN is a common Sumeri-
an formula that marks the end of the incantation, closing out what ÉN in line 19 began.
Notice the reprise “heaven and earth” thematically reflecting the divine epithet of Sha-
mash as judge of heaven and earth in the invocations to the prayer.
šamû liḫdūka erṣeti lirīška TU 6 ÉN
Line 36: Mirroring the language at the end of line 20, kīam tušadbabšu brackets the
supplicant’s prayer. DUG = karpatu, “pot.” GAR -an = tašakkan. Tummû (D of tamû), “to
bind by oath, to make someone swear.” Tutammāšu is a 2ms durative with a 3ms pronomi-
nal suffix. The 3ms pronouns on the verbs refer to the figurine. Tutammāšu introduces
what Scurlock calls a “ritual oath formula” (533). Such formulae occur in several ghost
prescriptions but are far from exclusive to such texts.
kīam tušadbabšu ana karpati tašakkaššū-ma tutammāšu
Line 37: Nīšu, “(oath on the) life.” The ritual formula literally reads, “(by) the life of
the earth/heaven.” Lū expresses a wish. Tamāta is a G 2ms predicative from tamû, “to
swear, to adjure.” DU 11 . GA = qabû, “to say.” We expect a 2ms durative form here. KÁ =
bābu, “gate, door;” but since it refers to the jar, it means “opening.” ÚŠ = peḫû, “to block,
to close, to seal.”
nīš šamê lū tamāta nīš erṣeti lū tamāta nīš Šamaš lū tamāta taqabbī-ma bābšu tepeḫḫi
Line 38: Ḫarbu, “desert, wasteland.” Nadûti, from nadû, see line 3. Qebēru, “to bury.”
Note how the ritual instructions come full circle with the mention of nadû: the abandoned
dust used to create the figurine is returned to an abandoned place.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Tawil demonstrated that Akkadian ṣalmu, “figurine, image” and Hebrew ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫צ‬ ֶ
are not only cognates but also share nearly identical semantic ranges (Tawil,𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 211
ALCBH, 323). However, in all cases save two, the creation of man (Gen 1:26–27)
and the birth of Seth (Gen 5:3), the Hebrew Bible views having, making, or
being a ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫צ‬ ֶ negatively. The expression ‫ם‬ ‫ֹת‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ‫תוֹע‬
‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫צ‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬, “and images of their abomi-
nations,” in Ezek 7:20, and ‫ם‬ ‫יכ‬ ֶ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫צ‬,
“your images,” in Amos 5:26 are examples of
the negative evaluations of figurines or images. Nowhere does the Hebrew Bible
clearly refer to a ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫צ‬ ֶ as having the same or similar function as the ṣalmu in this
Akkadian ritual. 1
The semantic equivalent of the complete epithet dayyān šamê u erṣeti, “judge
of heaven and earth,” does not occur in the Hebrew Bible. However, ‫ט‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֵ ‫שׁ‬ ‫א‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ִ
‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬,
“judge of the earth rise up,” in Ps 94:2 may reflect the first part of the epi-
thet here applied to Yahweh. The phrase ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ל־ה‬
‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ט‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֵ ‫שׁ‬ , “judge of all the earth,” in
Gen 18:25 may reflect the same traditional usage. 2 On “judge” as a divine epi-
thet in the Hebrew Bible, see Shamash 1 in the comparative suggestions (page
379).

While archaeologists have discovered many clay figurines from the Iron Age, none of them is
clearly of the type or function as those described in Akkadian exorcism rituals. For overviews of
Iron Age figurines from the southern Levant see Ziony Zevit, The Religions of Ancient Israel: A
Synthesis of Parallactic Approaches (London: Continuum, 2001), 267–74 and Ronald S. Hendel,

T RANSLATION :
1. If a ghost seizes a man and constantly pursues him or an evil alû-demon seizes
him 2. or a mukīl rēš lemutti-demon seizes him or something evil seizes him, to
expel (it) from his body, 3. dust of an abandoned city, dust of an abandoned
house, dust of an abandoned temple, dust of an abandoned tomb, dust from an
anthill, 4. dust of an abandoned canal, dust of a road, you gather together, you
mix (them) with bull’s blood, (and) you make a figurine of whatever evil thing
(it is). 5. (With) a lion’s skin you clothe it. You thread carnelian (and) place (it)
around its neck. You provide it with a leather bag, its travel provisions, 6. and
rations you give it. For three days, you place nine bowls of gruel before it (as) its
food ration. 7. On the roof of the house of the patient, you stand it. Then you
stir parched grain flour into water and beer, and you libate it. 8. You plant three
slivers of cedar around it. 9. You surround it with a magic circle. With an un-
fired fermenting vat 10. you cover over it. Let Shamash see the fermenting vat
during the day; let the stars see it during the night. 11. For three days, day and
night, the exorcist places twenty-three loaves (and) a censer of juniper before
Shamash. 12. At night, he pours out emmer flour before the stars of the night.
13. Before Shamash and the stars, for three days, he constantly recites over (it):
14. Incantation: Ghost (or) whatever evil, from this day forward, from the body
of so-and-so, son of so-and-so, you are expelled, dismissed,
15. Driven away, and banished. The god who placed you (there),21216. The goddess who placed you (there), they have expelled you from the body
of so-and-so, son of so-and-so, the patient.
17. On the third day, in the evening, you set up a ritual arrangement before
Shamash. 18. The patient raises the figurine before Shamash, and you make him
recite as follows:
19. Incantation: O Shamash, noble among the Anunnakki, prince among the
Igigi, pre-eminent leader, guide of the people,
20. Judge of heaven and earth, unchanging with regard to his command,
21. O Shamash, organizer of darkness, bringer of light for humanity,
22. O Shamash, at your setting, humanity’s light darkens; O Shamash, at your
rising, the four quarters brighten.
23. The homeless girl, the widow, the waif(?), and the female companion,
24. (By) your rising all humanity is warmed.
25. Beasts, living creatures, animals of the steppe,
26. They continually give you their lives, their limbs.
27. You judge the case of the wronged man and woman. You make their verdict
right.
I, so-and-so, son of so-and-so, exhausted, am kneeling (before) you,
28. Who on account of the anger of a god and goddess a binding has bound me.
29. An utukku-demon, a rābiṣu-demon, a ghost, a lilu-demon, paralysis, dizziness,
numbness of the flesh, vertigo,
30. Stiffness, (and) confusion weigh on me and daily. . . .
31. O Shamash, you are the judge. I bring you my life. I am kneeling for a
verdict with regard to the case of the disease that has seized me.
32. Judge my case. Provide my verdict. Until you make my case come to a
verdict,
33. To another case, do not deliver its verdict. After you make my case come to
verdict,
34. (And) my binding releases me and flees from my body, wherever I put my
trust, may the gods agree with one another with regard to what you say (lit.
your mouth).
35. May the heavens be joyful with you. May the earth rejoice in you. End of
incantation.
36. Thus you have him speak. You put it (i.e., the figurine) in a pot and you bind
it (i.e., the figurine) by oath: 37. “By Earth be adjured; by Heaven be adjured; by
Shamash be adjured,” you say and then you block its (i.e, the pot’s) opening.
38. . . . You bury it in abandoned wastelands.𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 213

A Shuilla: Anu 1
K YLE G REENWOOD
A NU :
Anu is known throughout Mesopotamian mythology as the sky god. The dei-
ty is represented in cuneiform with the AN sign. When this sign is read in Sume-
rian, it is pronounced /an/ and means “heaven,” which is the Sumerian name
for the deity (Sum. An; Akk. Anu). The sign is also commonly read in Sumerian
as dingir, which may refer to the generic word for “deity,” Akk. ilu, or as the
determinative for any deified being ( d DN). In the earliest cuneiform writing, AN
resembled a star or rosette.
In classic Mesopotamian mythology Anu was one of the three highest
ranked deities, along with Enlil and Ishtar. However, in the Great Hymn of the
Queen of Nippur, Anu shares paternity with Enlil and Sin. Anu possessed the
authority to decree and elevate fates. Along with Enlil, Anu was responsible for
conferring kingship and granting royal authority. Some epithets of Anu include
šar ilī, “king of the gods”; šar šamê, “king of heaven”; and šar matāti, “king of the
lands.”
As is the case with the other celestial deities, Anu is not only the god whose
dominion is heaven; Anu also represents the heavens themselves. Anu is the an-
tithesis of erṣetu, “earth.” In Atram-ḫasīs, Anu is known as abu, “father,” and the
aforementioned šar ilī, “king of the gods.” While Anu ascended to heaven, Enlil
assumed control of the earth. The Sumerian myth Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the
Netherworld intimates that heaven and earth were once a single entity, until
Anu carried off and occupied heaven, and Enlil carried off and occupied earth.
In the Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, Anu is associated with military action. In this
epic Anu is said to press miṭṭa lā pādâ elu targīgi “the relentless mace upon the
wicked.” However, Anu is not typically associated with warfare. Rather, the dei-
ty is summoned amid dire circumstances so the Kassite king Kashtiliash might
feel the full brunt of Assyria’s pantheon.
Based on the textual and archaeological record, the cult of Anu had limited
official geographical distribution. Apparently, Anu received limited homage in
Dilbat, Kesh and Ur. However, the deity also appears to have had a dais at É-sag-
íl in Babylon. In Ashur, Anu and Adad shared a long-standing temple that con-
sisted of a pair of ziggurats, one for each deity. Of primary significance, howev-
er, was the Anu cult in Uruk. Anu’s temple, named Bīt Rēš in Akkadian, was one
217218of two major temple structures, the other one being the temple of Inana. Both
temples were extensively rebuilt during the Seleucid and Parthian periods.
In Mesopotamian astronomical tradition, “the path of Anu” (ḫarrān šūt
Anim) lay between the “paths” of Enlil and Ea (see page 411 for more on the
celestial “paths”). With respect to iconography, Anu’s divine symbol is the
horned cap. His divine number was 60, the highest among the gods.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer to Anu follows the standard tripartite construction of a shuilla.
The hymnic introduction (lines 1–8a) consists of four parts. The first three parts
are organized in sets of parallel lines, following Sumerian hymnic style (see
Mayer, UFBG, 40). In each case, the second line begins with the vocative “O
Anu” then repeats the first line verbatim. The first of the four parts impresses
upon the deity his worthiness to be called upon. Anu is “magnificent” and is
associated with holy purification rites. The second part appeals to Anu’s status in
the cosmic realm. The third and fourth parts of the hymnic introduction shift
from appealing to the deity’s generic value as the hearer of prayers to the deity’s
specific merit for hearing this particular prayer. Not only is Anu the magnificent
god of the heavens, but, more importantly to the supplicant, Anu is the deity
who can remove the afflictions from this persecuted human.
The petition section (lines 8b–13) consists of a series of five requests, fol-
lowed by the imperative “have mercy!” There is a sort of rhythmic cadence in
this section as the prayer moves from the beneficence of the deity to the trans-
gressions of the person; from the ferocity of the supplicant’s personal gods, to
the compassion of the magnificent Anu. The petition demonstrates the precari-
ous nature in which anguished people of the ancient world found themselves
with respect to their health and the whims of the gods.
The prayer concludes (lines 14–16) with a section of promissory praise.
Should Anu successfully intervene on behalf of the supplicant, this person will
reward the deity with riches and honor.
Aside from the use of parallelism in the first section, the prayer employs a
number of recurring words. For example, bēlu occurs once in each of the first six
lines and once in line 15. Pašāru occurs in participial form three times in the
hymnic introduction and twice as a precative in the petition section. In that
same section, lemnētu and Ḫaṭâtu appear three times each. These recurring words
are significant in that they not only influence the themes of their respective sec-
tions, but they also serve to unify the prayer as a cohesive composition.
In the Bīt salāʾ mê purification ritual series this prayer to Anu initiates the
ninth section (pirsu) of the series, which consists of prayers to multiple deities,
including Nusku, Sin, Gula and Shamash. The ritual itself was named for the
location in which it was performed, the Bīt salāʾ mê, “House of Water Sprin-𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : A NU 1
219
kling.” It involved the transfer of evil from the king to its suspected source by
means of a purification bath. 1
There are three known MSS of this prayer, BMS 6: 1–16 (referred to here as
MS A), CT 51 211 ( MS B), and LKA 50 ( MS C). All of these are incomplete, but the
latter is the best preserved (at least, after line 6). The treatment presented here
follows the line numbering of BMS 6 as a matter of convenience (see likewise
Foster’s translation). The text at the beginning of the prayer is very fragmentary,
shows signs of scribal errors (especially in MS C), and varies among the sources.
The text of lines 1–6 presented here is, therefore, tentative. With line 7, this
treatment follows MS C. Even here, due to the fragmentary nature of the text,
many reconstructions are conjectural. The present text cannot substitute for
studying the original manuscripts or consulting a new modern edition, which is
unfortunately still a desideratum.

ÉN EN

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer, but is not a part of the prayer itself. EN = bēlu, “master, lord, ruler.” Šurbû,
“great, supreme,” is a Š stem verbal adjective from rabû. Note that the superlative form in
Akkadian, known as the elative, is expressed via the Š verbal adjective. The prayer begins
appropriately by praising the deity as bēlu šurbû, “most excellent lord.” Ša with a resump-
tive pronoun such as – Š u attached to a noun X is a common grammatical construct mean-
ing “whose X.” Ina šamê (= AN ), “in heaven,” reflects Anu’s chief role as god of the heav-
ens. Šuluḫḫu, “purification rite,” usually occurs in the plural, as here (see CAD Š/3, 260).
Ellū is a G 3mp predicative from elēlu (= KÙ ), “to be clean, pure, holy, sacred.”

Line 2: Lines 1–6 consist of three pairs of parallel lines that imitate Sumerian hymnic
style. Each pair moves from the general to the specific. The first line of each pair addresses
the deity with a particular epithet. The epithet is repeated verbatim in the second line of
the pair, except that the deity addressed is called by name. Notice the retention of mi-
mation in the DN Anu, which is otherwise absent in the text.
Anum bēlu šurbû ša ina šamê šuluḫḫūšu ellū
Line 3: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” MS B begins the line with bēlu instead of ilu. Ṣaddu means
“sign, signal,” particularly as it pertains to omens. AGA = agû, “crown.” In some texts the
crown of Anu represents kingship in the divine council. The title bēl agê, “lord of the
crown,” also underscores Anu’s authority to coronate kings. In the astrological text Astro-
labe B, the crown of Anu is a constellation called is lê, “Jawbone-of-an-Ox.”
il šamê bēl ṣaddi bēl agê
Line 4: If the connection between Anu and the heavens were not clear from line 1,
there can be no mistaking the connection in line 4. This relationship is even more striking
with the presence of three DINGIR signs in the line. There is some ambiguity—perhaps
intended—regarding the precise function of the genitive šamê. The options are “heaven’s
god,” “the heavenly god,” “the god in heaven,” or “the god whose domain is the heavens.”
MS C seems to have skipped our lines 4 and 5, probably due to parablepsis (homoioarch-
ton).
Anum il šamê bēl ṣaddi bēl agê
Line 5: Lines 5–8 employ substantive participles to define the attributes of the deity
that are pertinent to the petitioner’s request. Pašāru, “to release, to loosen.” As is often the
case with this verb, a deity, in this case Anu, is its agent. Ūmu, “day,” is in the genitive
case, which is to be expected by the fact that it is preceded by a participle in the bound
form. The exact meaning of pāšir ūmi, “the one who absolves the day,” is uncertain. One
suggestion is that it refers to a clearing of the weather (see CAD P, 239). The context of the
prayer does not warrant such an interpretation here. Rather, the day in question is likely
the day of suffering, which is the impetus for the prayer. Thus, it likely refers to the re-
moval of that day of suffering from the memory of the supplicant.
pāšir ūmi bēl ṣaddi bēl agê
Line 6: MS B attests the start of a fragmentary line between lines 5 and 6 and again
between lines 6 and 7. In both cases the line reads mukallim ṣaddi, “the one who reveals
the sign.”

Line 7: MÁŠ . GE 6 = šuttu (pl. šunātu), “dream.” ḪUL = lemnu, “bad, evil, wicked.” Ḫaṭû
(ḫāṭû), “wrong, defective, portending evil.” Pardu, “frightening,” particularly as it pertains
to dreams. Á . MEŠ = idātu, “powers, signs, omens.” GISKIM . MEŠ = ittātu, “marks, signs,
omens.” Pāšir is followed by a string of fp genitive nouns and adjectives. The first noun,
šunāti, is modified by three adjectives, lemnēti, haṭâti, and pardāti. The adjective lemnēti is
understood here as modifying both idāti and ittāti, though it is equally plausible that it
only modifies the latter. From this line to the end of the prayer, MS C is the textual basis.
pāšir šunāti lemnēti ḫaṭâti pardāti idāti ittāti lemnēti
Line 8: Lines 8 and 9 are problematic from a textual perspective. The present treat-
ment closely follows MS C (cited as an alternate reading in Seux, 271, n.11 and a variant by
Foster, 640, n.2). Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to cause to pass through, to cross,” thus “to remove,
to avert.” Lumnu, “evil, wickedness.” Ḫiṭītu, “act of negligence, sin, offense.” Gillatu,
“crime, misdeed, sin.” Maruštu (maruṣtu, marṣu, see CAD M/I, 291), “severe, grievous.”
Ḫūṣu, “pain.” GAZ = ḫīpu at its root means “a break,” but this brokenness when applied to
one’s health connotes “disease, ailment, or affliction.” Ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi is understood idiomati-
cally and may refer to either physical or emotional pain (CAD Ḫ, 260). Originally, ḫūṣ ḫīpi
libbi was likely a hendiadys, explaining the use of the plural verb (see luptaṭṭirū in line 9).
The relative ša that follows begins a subordinate clause telling more about this situation in
terms of the supplicant’s experience. The three verbs in the subordinate clause are plural
forms. Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be inflicted” (CAD Š/1, 154). The enclitic –ma joins this
verb with line 9.
mušēteq lumni ḫiṭīte u gillate marušte ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi ša iššaknū-ma
Line 9: UŠ . UŠ = riteddû (Gtn of redû), “to guide constantly, to control constantly; to
persecute continually.” The reduplication of the UŠ sign is an indication of the Gtn. Kussu
(D of kasû), “to bind.” I take the first two verbs in this line as duratives, showing the ongo-
ing effects of the situation described by iššaknū-ma in line 8. UZU = šīru, “flesh.” TI . LA =
balāṭu, “life.” Tû, “incantation, spell.” Ina tēka ša balāṭi is a formulaic expression. Seux
(271, n.12) suggests ittēka, as preserved in MS C, might be a contraction of ina tēka, which
is only preserved in MS A. Putaṭṭuru (Dt of paṭāru), “to be loosened, to be released.” The lu–
prefix usually indicates a 1cs precative but the verb seems to refer back to Ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi
(understood as a plural) and therefore must be a 3cp precative. Therefore, the prefix, only
attested in MS C from Ashur, is probably an Assyrianism. See GAG §81c on page 132.

Line 10: Mimmû mala, “all that,” introduces a relative clause. Note the 1cs pronomi-
nal suffixes ( MU ) on ilu and ištaru (= IŠ 8 . DAR ), indicating these are the supplicant’s personal22211. lìb-bi DINGIR . MU u [ d IŠ 8 . DAR . MU ] ze-nu-te a-na KI -šú l[i-tu-ur]

god and goddess. Ištaru, rather than iltu, is used for the personal goddess when parallel
with ilu (see CAD I/J, 90). Aḫṭû is a G 1cs preterite (aḫṭi) plus subjunctive –u from ḫaṭû, “to
do wrong (ana, to), to sin (against).” Lippašra is a 3cs precative with the ventive from
napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released.”
mimmû mala ana ilīya u ištarīya aḫṭû lippašra
Line 11: Zenû, “angry.” The genitive plural form of this adj. indicates it modifies both
ilu and ištaru. Târu with ašru means, “to return to normal, to subside.” In ancient Mesopo-
tamian thought, physical distress was most often associated with offenses committed
against the gods. The only remedy was to appease the gods, confess one’s transgressions,
and plea for divine reprieve. Thus, the request is for freedom from the physical anguish
caused by the angry gods.
libbi ilīya u ištarīya zenūte ana ašrīšu litūr
Line 12: Aggu, “angry.” As is typical in the phrase aggu libbu, aggu assumes the atypi-
cal position of preceding the noun it modifies. Libbu often refers to the heart as the seat of
the intellect; therefore, “mind, intent, choice.” Note the use of a 2ms pronominal suffix
rather than the 2mp, as we might expect as both god and goddess were previously men-
tioned. Linūḫa is a G 3cs precative with ventive from nâhu, “to be at rest, to relent.”
aggu libbaka linūḫa
Line 13: Kabattu (kabtatu in poetic texts) is literally a “liver” but it also means “emo-
tions, thoughts, mind, spirit.” It is the subject of lippašra from napšuru, for which see line
10. Rašû, “to get, to acquire.” The form is a ms impv. with ventive. On the expression rišâ
rēmu and its variants, see Mayer, UFBG, 225. Having declared Anu as the deity who gener-
ally releases (pašāru) misfortune in line 7, the supplicant now calls upon the deity to make
those powers effective in this particular case. One should expect rēmu to be in the accusa-
tive case, but the nominative frequently stands for the accusative in SB Akkadian and the
current form is frequently attested in the idiom, rišâ rēmu, “to show pity; have mercy” (see
CAD R, 199).
lippašra kabtatka rišâ rēmu
Line 14: Ṭuḫḫudu (D of ṭaḫādu), “to provide lavishly, to endow richly, to make pros-
perous.” The characteristic doubled second radical in the orthography is missing. However,
the a-i vowel pattern is sufficient to diagnose this form as a D 1 cs precative. É = bītu,
“house.” The function of both precatives in this sentence is to conclude the petitions in
lines 8b–13. The supplicant wishes to lavish the deity with material and verbal offerings
when the deity honors his request. Šigaru, “door bolt, lock.” Zanānu, “to poor out, to drip.”
Here the form is a Š 1cs precative. The causative verb takes the double accusative: “I make𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : A NU 1

Line 15: Dalīlū, “praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlī ludlul is a cognate accusative con-
struction; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomat-
ically, “let me proclaim the praises.”

Line 16: Narbû, “greatness,” is a verbal adjective from the N stem of rabû. The singu-
lar bound form is narbi. Kayyāna, “always, constantly.” Note the antecedent for the 2ms
pronominal suffix on ilūtu is Anu. The –ūt ending on the noun ilu is the abstract noun
marker, creating the meaning “the state of being a god” or “divinity.” Šitammuru (Gtn of
šamāru), “to praise continually.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Aside from its structural similarity to biblical prayers of lament like Ps 22,
perhaps the most obvious point of comparison with this text and the Hebrew
Bible is the association of the deity with the heavens. In this shuilla Anu is twice
referred to as il šamê, “god of heaven,” a reference to the deity’s cosmic abode,
or to its very divine nature. The biblical equivalent occurs as ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ in BH
and as ‫א‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫ש‬ ְ ‫הּ‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫א‬ ֱ in biblical Aramaic. Most, if not all, of the twenty-three instanc-
es of this phrase seem to appear in late texts. 1 Nonetheless, the authors of the
Hebrew Bible apply this epithet to their god, Yahweh.
However, this point of contact leads also to a point of strong contrast. It is
one thing to be deemed the heavenly god, or to have the heavens declared a
god, as is the case with Anu. It is quite another matter simply to state that the
heavens constitute one of the abodes of the deity, as is the case with Yahweh. In
fact, the Hebrew Bible is adamant that the heavens are not divine, but are mere-
ly one of Yahweh’s many creations. Genesis 1:1 proclaims that Elohim “created
1
See Gen 24:3, 7; 2 Chr 36:23; Ezra 1:2; 5:11; 7:12, 21, 23 (x2); Neh 1:2, 4, 5; 2:4, 20; Dan
2:18, 37, 44; Jonah 1:9. Although the dating of Gen 24:3 and 7 is speculative, J. van Seters has
made the most cogent argument for dating the Yahwist source to the late exilic period (Abraham
in History and Tradition [New Haven: Yale, 1975], 148–53). Another view is that Gen 24:3, 7
reflect “an older concept” that is revived in the Persian period (Hutter, 389).224the heavens and the earth.” In Isa 42:5, Yahweh is “the one who created the
heavens.” The phrase is not an action, but an epithet; it serves to define Yah-
weh’s role and power. Ps 102:25 expresses the same idea in more anthropo-
morphic terms, “the heavens are the work of your hands.” This idea of Yahweh
as creator of the heavens, not simply a resident of the heavens, is conveyed in
multiple texts in which Yahweh is said to have created the heavenly bodies, such
as the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Thus, while Anu and Yahweh are
both gods of the heavens, the Hebrew Bible repeatedly distinguishes Yahweh
from the heavens. One possible exception is Dan 4:23, ‫א‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫ן‬ ‫ט‬ ִ ‫לּ‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫דּ‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ‫דּ‬ ַ ְ‫נ‬ ‫ת‬ ִ , “You
will acknowledge that Heaven is mighty.” In this case, “Heaven” is the subject of
the predicate adjective “mighty,” and represents the only instance in which
“Heaven” is synonymous with the god of Israel. 2 However, it may well be that
“Heaven” is no more deified in this verse than “the White House” is considered
the President of the United States. Each refers to the location from which ulti-
mate authority of its respective precinct resides.
Although the phrase pāšir ūmi does not have a counterpart in BH, the con-
cept is at the forefront of Job’s distress. During the initial response to his calami-
ty, he cried out ‫ְך‬ ‫ֺשׁ‬ ֶ ‫ח‬ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ְ‫י‬ ‫הוּא‬ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫היּוֺם‬ , “may that day (i.e., the day he was born) be as
darkness” (3:4). If that day had never happened, he would not have lived his
tortuous existence. While not worded the same, Job’s desire is essentially the
same as that of this prayer’s supplicant, namely, may the deity remove all traces
of this arduous day from thought or memory. On a separate note, the verb
pašāru has ‫פתר‬ as its Hebrew cognate and ‫פשׁר‬ as its Aramaic cognate. This verb
is found only in the context of the Joseph Narrative (Gen 40–41) and in Dan 5.
Always with “dream” as its object, it literally means, “to loosen the dream,” im-
plying that there is a trapped meaning of the dream that must be released in
order for the dream to be interpreted.
Continuing this theme, dreams in the ancient Near East were powerful forc-
es. They were considered channels of divine communication. 3 Given the fact that
deities could be either beneficent or malevolent depending on one’s piety,
dreams could elicit a frightening experience. Such is the case, once again, with
Job. He cries out in protest to Yahweh, “If I say, ‘My bed comforts me and my
couch bears my complaint,’ then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with
visions; so that my throat chooses suffocation, and my bones, death” (7:13–15).
In this light, it is no wonder both the supplicant and Job would wish for dreams
to be absolved.
Line 14 reflects the ancient Near Eastern notion that the earthly temple was
a scale model of the deity’s heavenly residence. A stairway connected the two
abodes, with a gate situated at the top of the stairway at the entrance of the
2
The idea of a deified heaven is prevalent in the books of 1 Macc (3:18, 19, 50; 4:24) and 2
Macc (7:11; 8:20).

cosmic dwelling. This concept is most clearly reflected in the Tower of Babel
narrative of Gen 11:1–9. It is also reflected in Gen 28:17, in which Jacob, after
having experienced a terrifying theophany, proclaimed, ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ית‬ ‫ם־בּ‬
‫א‬ ִ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫ז‬ ‫ין‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫זּ‬ ‫ה‬ ַ
‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫ז‬ ְ‫ו‬ , “Is this none other than the temple of the gods? Is this not the
gate of heaven?” Jacob not only alludes to the mythological concept, but also
affirms it by equating the temple with the gate of heaven. This notion is likely at
work in Ezek 43:4, as well, in which Yahweh’s glory enters the temple by way of
the gate.

A Shuilla: Ea 1a
A LAN L ENZI
E A :
Ea (Akk.; Sum. Enki) was the god of fresh water, wisdom, and magic. Origi-
nally from the southern city of Eridu (modern Abu Shahrain), Ea was venerated
throughout Mesopotamia from earliest times into the Hellenistic period. Besides
his temple at Eridu, Ea had cult installations in Borsippa, Drehem, Kish, Lagash,
Larsa, Mari, Shuruppak, Umma, and Uruk, among others. In the first millenni-
um, the imperial capitals of Assyria and Babylon both had prominent cult cen-
ters dedicated to the deity.
Various traditions make Ea the son of Anu or the son of the goddess Nam-
mu. His wife is Damgalnuna/Damkina. His most prominent son is Marduk,
though he is also the father of Adapa and Nanshe, among others. His well-known
grandson is Nabu, god of wisdom and scribes. Ea’s vizier is the two-faced
Isimud/Usmu.
Ea was first and foremost the god of fresh water, the basis of life and agri-
cultural abundance. The ancient city of Eridu was the location of his main tem-
ple, É-abzu, “Apsu-house” (also called É-engur-ra, “House of Fresh Waters”),
which in ancient times was situated in a marshy area near the coast where the
Euphrates emptied into the Persian Gulf. This ecological locale may explain his
watery association and almost certainly the large amounts of fish bones—
remnants of offerings—that archaeologists have recovered in deep soundings of
his temple. 1
Mythologically, Ea resided in a subterranean watery place called the Apsû,
the source of all fresh waters. According to Enūma eliš Tablet I, Apsu (male) and
Tiamat (female) were originally two primordial bodies of water that mingled to
create all of the gods. When Ea learned of Apsu’s plot to kill his noisy offspring,
Ea immobilized Apsu with an incantation, killed him, and turned him into his
divine abode. This mythological narrative reflects what is widely known from
other religious and ritual texts: Ea’s incantatory word was powerful and effective
(see our lines 13, 24, and 26).
1
See Michael D. Danti and Richard L. Zettler, “Eridu,” in OEANE 2:258–60.
227228Ea was widely known in Mesopotamian tradition as a protective, benevo-
lent, and caring god to humans. According to several myths, Ea had a hand in
creating humanity and was always ready to help preserve his creation in the face
of danger, even when this meant, as in Gilgamesh XI and Atram-ḫasīs, subverting
the plan of the other gods who had decreed humanity’s destruction. As seen in
the myths Inana and Enki and Enki and the World Order, Ea was also the origi-
nal holder of the divine powers (Sum. me) that gave shape to the world and or-
ganized human civilization. According to another sparsely preserved tradition,
Ea sent seven antediluvian sages (apkallū) to bring the arts of civilization to hu-
manity; the most prominent of these is Adapa. These seven sages occasionally
appear in incantations. 2
As god of wisdom and magic, Ea played a prominent role as patron of vari-
ous crafts, including those of everyday artisans as well as those especially asso-
ciated with intermediation between humans and gods (i.e., exorcism, lamenta-
tion, divination, astrology, and medicine in the first millennium). 3 A common
incantatory phrase used in namburbi-rites, “Ea has done, Ea has undone” (īpuš
Ea ipšur Ea), reflects Ea’s protective and benevolent character as well as the mag-
ical power of his word. 4
In keeping with his role as god of water, Ea was identified in iconography
by streams of water pouring out of his shoulders. Sometimes he appears in a
structure that is surrounded by water, probably representing the Apsu. In post-
Kassite times, Ea was symbolized by the goat-fish, a turtle, or a curved staff with
a ram’s head on the end.
Like Anu and Enlil, Ea was associated with one of the three regions (or
“paths,” ḫarrānū) of the sky and the stars therein. Ea’s region was the southern
most (see page 411 for more on the celestial “paths”). Ea was closely associated
with the constellation Nūnu, “The Fish” (our Piscis Austrinus). Ea’s divine num-
ber was 40.
T HE P RAYER :
Ea 1a follows the typical tri-partite structure found in many other incanta-
tion-prayers. The prayer begins with a fairly long introductory hymn in lines 1–
13, continues with the supplication section in lines 14–28, and concludes with
three lines of praise (lines 29–31).

The long opening hymn may be analyzed as consisting of four parts (or
stanzas) of unequal size. Lines 1–6 form the first part. In each of these lines
there are two epithets for Ea, each of which celebrates his authority, wisdom,
and/or role as creator and sustainer. These latter two roles are expressed by
means of participles in lines 1a and 6, which grammatically distinguish them
from the other epithets in this first part of the hymn. The very general epithets
in line 1 are complemented in lines 2–5 by several that localize Ea in his home
town of Eridu and the cult centers dedicated to him there (É-abzu, É-engur-ra,
and É-unir). Finally, line 6, with its reference to waterways, prepares for the
second section of the hymn in lines 7–8. This second part utilizes tight grammat-
ical parallelism (see the comments to line 8) and second person verbs to bestow
praise upon the deity. Ea’s natural sphere of influence (i.e., water and abun-
dance) comes into clear focus here. In the third part of the hymn (lines 9–11)
the hymn shifts to describe what others think of Ea. Third person verbs domi-
nate these lines. Foreshadowing the concluding praise of the prayer (see lines
29–31), lines 9–10 depict the gods of heaven and the netherworld praising Ea. In
line 11, the people, sandwiched between the two divine realms, praise Ea for his
authority (zikirka kabta) and thereby prepare both for the final section of the
hymn and lines 14–16 in the petitions. 5 Lines 12–13 close the hymn with a ref-
erence to Ea’s role as sagacious councilor to the gods (line 12), recalling line 1
generally, and an affirmation of the life giving power of his authoritative, incan-
tatory word (line 13). This last line of the hymn is the first to associate Ea ex-
plicitly with magic. The power here attributed to Ea’s “incantation of life,”
namely, that it keeps the moribund from death, anticipates the phrase’s appear-
ance later in the petitions (lines 24 and 26) and segues nicely into the supplica-
tion section of the prayer, which is centered on the supplicant’s desire for a
healthy, long life (line 17).
The supplication section of the prayer is dominated by two motifs, effective
speech (lines 14–20) and release from witchcraft (lines 21–28), each of which
provide a perspective on the over-arching theme of the prayer: life. In lines 14–
20 effective speech is first requested from Ea (14–16). The supplicant wants Ea
to give the order so that they may be restored, their speech be heard, and they
achieve favorable things. Line 17 follows with a strong expression of the suppli-
cant’s desire for life. Note the imperative, the last one in the prayer, followed by
the precative. This line announces the prayer’s central theme at its most general
level and anticipates the specific requests of line 28 (at the end of the second
half of the supplication section). Lines 18–19 then turn to the issue of the sup-
plicant’s speech and desire for it to be acceptable to their personal deities and to
influence the actions of both god and king. The juxtaposition of lines 17 and 18–
19 suggest that “life” is inextricably united to the issue of social acceptance and
5
For an insightful treatment of this section of the prayer and its anticipation of the final prayer’s
concluding praise, see Hunt, 47–59.230standing. The final petition of this first half of the supplication section mentions
the instruments of speech, mouth and tongue, and requests their intercession.
The second half of the supplication section is dominated by the supplicant’s
concern for release from witchcraft. In lines 21–23 the supplicant begins with a
request that any evil machinations not approach. In lines 24–25, using similar
language as in lines 21–23 (lines 22 and 24b are identical), the supplicant re-
quests that the machinations (that apparently have arrived) depart. Then in lines
26–27 the supplicant requests the release of the bonds of witchcraft, which im-
plies they actually have the supplicant in their grip. Just as the evil intensifies in
lines 21–27 so too do the supplicant’s appeals to authorities that can counter
them: Ea’s incantation is cited in lines 24 and 26 and Ea’s recruitment of Mar-
duk, his son and traditional assistant in some forms of incantations (see the
comments), is requested in line 27. The end result for all of these requests comes
out only in line 28: that the supplicant’s body be free of illness.
The prayer does not conclude with the typical line or two in which the sup-
plicant promises to praise the deity. Rather, it ends with three lines that present
a unique arrangement of several traditional phrases of praise in which the gods
are the actors. 6
Despite the fact that there is only a single line of ritual instructions pre-
served on one manuscript, Mayer’s MS A, we know that Ea 1a, as with several
other shuilla-prayers, was incorporated into various ritual complexes as a pre-
scribed prayer. For example, its incipit is cited in a royal investiture ritual, 7 a
universal namburbi handbook (SpBTU II, no. 18, rev. 27), 8 and part of Bīt rimki
(see Zimmern, BBR 26 iii 45). 9
6
See Mayer, UFBG, 327–40 for this form of ending generally and 337 for the unique arrange-
ment of the various elements in Ea 1a specifically. Mayer’s MS F expands the praise to four lines
by incorporating another traditional phrase (see 446, n.21[1]).

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer on the tablet. It is not a part of the prayer itself. LUGAL = šarru, “king.” Nēmequ,
“wisdom.” Banû, “to create, to build.” Tašīmtu, “prudence, practical intelligence, discern-
ment.” One might choose to translate the genitives in this line adjectivally. Thus, e.g.,
“king of wisdom” may be rendered “wise king.” The hymnic introduction begins with epi-
thets befitting the Mesopotamian god of wisdom.
šiptu: šar nēmeqi bānû tašīmti
Line 2: Massû, “leader, expert,” like many other terms in the hymnic introduction, is
commonly used to describe rulers and deities (see CAD M/1, 327–28). Ṣīru, “exalted, su-
preme, august.” (W)usmu, “someone or something worthy, suitable,” is another term used
to describe both gods and kings (see AHw, 1497). Usum is the bound form of the noun. É-
zu-ab, “House of the Abzu,” is the Sumerian name of Ea’s temple in Eridu, his original
home town. The Abzu (Sum.; Akk. Apsû), is Ea’s residence, located in the subterranean
fresh waters (see, e.g., Enūma eliš I 71).

after noting three texts that equate Sum. bàn-da with Akk. tašīmtu, translates the epithet as
“Enlil of expertise,” that is, Ea is the ultimate authority within the sphere of wisdom (30–
32, and n.39). He sees this epithet as connecting line 3 back to the use of tašīmtu in line 1
(24–25). Itpēšu, “wise, expert,” is an adjective used to describe kings and deities (see CAD
I/J, 299). Karūbu, “honored one, reverently greeted one.” This word is only attested with
deities.

gods). ERI . DU 10 = Eridu, Ea’s home town. The case vowel on uršānu indicates that it is not2325. EN é-[engur-r]a ṣu-lul

bound to Eridu; thus, the toponym is functioning adverbially, indicating the hero’s place of
origin. ABGAL (NUN-ME) = apkallu, “sage.” This term is often used of gods (e.g., Ea and
Marduk) as well as special humans, such as Adapa and the other antediluvian sages (see J.
C. Greenfield, “Apkallu,” DDD, 72–74). Igigû is a general name for the gods of heaven, in
contrast to Anunnakkū, who are the gods of the netherworld (see Black and Green, 106;
Enūma eliš VI 69 gives the Igigû as three hundred in number and the Anunnakkū six hun-
dred; contradicting this, VI 39–44 number both groups as three hundred).
uršānu Eridu apkal Igigî
Line 5: EN = bēlu, “lord.” É-engur-ra, “House of Fresh Waters,” is another Sumerian
name for Ea’s temple in Eridu. Ṣulūlu, “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor of divine
or royal protection (see CAD Ṣ, 243). É-u 6 -nir, the Sumerian name of Ea’s ziggurrat at
Eridu ( U 6 . NIR is the logogram for Akk. ziqqurratu, “temple tower”). The parallelism between
bēlu and ṣulūlu in this line mutually illuminates the meanings of these two terms. The epi-
thets here and in the next few lines reflect Ea’s status as the Mesopotamian god of water.
bēl E-engura ṣulūl E-unir
Line 6: Babālu, “to carry, to bring,” is a by-form of (w)abālu. ILLU (A-KAL) = mīlu,
“high water, flood.” Bringing high waters is a positive thing here, as the next word in the
genitive chain, ḪÉ . GÁL = ḫegallu, “prosperity, abundance,” and the second half of the line
explain. Ruššu (D of râšu), “to make rejoice.” ÍD = nāru, “river.” DIDLI is a plural marker
like MEŠ . Notice the parallel participles. Does “rejoicing rivers” refer to the sound of faster
moving water in the river beds (see likewise, Hunt, 36)?
bābil mīl ḫegalli murīš nāri
Line 7: Tâmtu, “sea, lake, large body of water.” The noun appears here as a fp abso-
lute form (without case ending). Whether there is a grammatical (rather than, e.g., met-
rical) purpose for the absolute form is unclear. Ṣuṣû, “reed thicket.” Reed thickets, espe-
cially prominent in the marshlands of the south, teemed with animals and plants that
humans in ancient Mesopotamia could use to their advantage for both food and raw mate-
rials. Eridu was located near the marshes. Dešû, “to let prosper, to provide someone or
something bountifully with something.” ḪÉ . NUN = nuḫšu, “plenty, abundance.” The text
continues to praise Ea’s watery beneficence in this line.
ina tâmāt u ṣuṣê tudešši nuḫša
Line 8: Note the tight grammatical parallelism with line 7: prepositional phrase be-
ginning with ina, a second person verb, then the direct object. The longer prepositional
phrase in line 7 is balanced here by a genitive chain for the direct object. Qerbetu, “envi-
rons, meadowland.” Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to create, to produce.” ZI = napištu, “life, subsist-
ence, livelihood.” UN . MEŠ = nišū, “people.” Ea’s beneficial creative activity extends beyond
the watery areas to include the meadows. Mayer’s MS D identifies the “life” of the people𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : E A 1 A

Line 9: Anu, the sky god, was the high god of the Mesopotamian pantheon but was a
deus otiosus. d EN . LÍL = Ellil, god of the wind and another of the high gods, was the active
head of the pantheon until he was replaced by Marduk, probably in the late second mil-
lennium. Ḫadiš, “joyfully.” Râšu, “to rejoice, to exult.” Rīšū is a 3mp predicative. The ob-
ject of the verb is the cause for rejoicing.
Anu u Ellil ḫadiš rīšūka
Line 10: For the Anunnakkī, see line 4 above. Māḫāzu, “shrine, cult center.” Karābu,
“to bless, greet (with a blessing).” The Anunnakkī are mentioned, whose place in the neth-
erworld was the extreme opposite of the heavenly abodes of Anu and Ellil.
Anunnakkī ina māḫāzīšunu ikarrabūka
Line 11: KUR = mātu, “land, earth.” Šitmuru (Gt of šamāru), “to praise.” Zikru, “utter-
ance, command.” Kabtu, “heavy, weighty, important, honored.” Between heaven (line 9)
and the netherworld (line 10) are the people. Gods and humans both laud Ea.
nišū māti ištammarā zikirka kabta
Line 12: DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” GAL . MEŠ = rabûtu (mp), “great.” Nadānu, “to give.”
The –md– in the middle of the verb is the result of nasalization (–dd– changes to –md–).
Milku, “counsel, advice.” As a god of wisdom, Ea is especially suited to counsel the gods.
(But see the similar line in the prayer to Sin, page 392.)
ana ilī rabûti tanamdin milka
Line 13: In the last line of the opening hymn the prayer invokes the deity’s primary
name for the first time (see also line 24). Tû, “incantation, spell.” TI (. LA ) = balāṭu, “life,
health” (see also line 17). Lā, “not,” is used here with the durative verb to form a prohibi-
tion (“he shall not die”). Mâtu, “to die.” LÚ . ÚŠ = mītu, literally means “dead,” but it seems
the word sometimes means someone who is as good as dead but has not ceased bodily
function. Foster (643) translates the word with “moribund,” which captures its meaning
nicely. The effectiveness of Ea’s incantatory word is well-known. See, e.g., Enūma eliš I 62–
63.

Line 14: The prayer turns now to petition, as the two imperatives indicate. Ullû (D of
elû), “to raise up.” Rēšu, “head.” When a social superior raised a person’s head, it meant
taking notice of the person’s lowly condition and restoring them to their former status or
position. Nabû, “to name, to call,” with šumu, “name,” as its object (the nominative case
ending often occurs where the accusative is expected in SB Akkadian) means “to summon,
to call a person (to exercise a function), to appoint a person to an office” (see CAD N/1,
35–37). The supplicant is asking Ea to change their lowly situation, whatever it was. May-
er’s MS E inserts a two line self-presentation formula, naming a certain Balāṭa-ēreš, and a
standardized lament at this point in the prayer (see Mayer, UFBG, 50–52, 102–3, and 444,
n.6[1]).
ulli rēšīya ibi šumu
Line 15: Qibītu, “speech, command.” The ending of the first word bears the locative-
adverbial –um, which is the equivalent of ina (see line 16), and a 2ms pronominal suffix.
(The m of the locative assimilates into the k of the suffix; –mk– becomes –kk–.) Nešmû (N
of šemû), “to be heard.” Zikru, see line 11. Whether the supplicant is asking that the words
of the prayer specifically or their words in broader society generally be heard, the line
demonstrates how effective human speech is founded on divine decree (divine effective
speech). As if to underline this point, the verbs in this and the next line have changed from
imperatives (as in lines 14 and 16) to precatives.
qibītukka liššemû zikrūya
Line 16: Qību, “command, pronouncement.” SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f), “favora-
ble, good.” Kašādu, “to accomplish, to reach, to achieve.” Ana often accompanies kašādu,
indicating what or where one is reaching or achieving. The results of effective speech are
also requested: favorable things.
ina qībīka ana damiqti lukšud
Line 17: Šarāku, “to give, to grant, to bestow.” TI . LA , see line 13. Bâru, “to stay firm,
to remain in good health.” A variant, lul-bur, in MS E may derive the verb from labāru, “to
be(come) old.” But we would expect lul-bir, if that were the case. Perhaps we should read
MS E as lu ! -bur or lu 5? -bur here (see Seux, 277, n.20). Ana dāri, “forever and ever,” should
not be taken too literally. The supplicant is not asking for immortality; rather, they want to
live a very, very long time. With this petition, the supplicant reaches the very root of their
desire: life.

Line 18: Atmû, “speech, manner of speaking.” UGU = eli. d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” Ṭâbu

accurate, the above suggested restoration is better than Mayer’s LUGAL ; see likewise Foster,
643 and Seux, 277, n.22. Mayer’s MS E contains a variant: ilū u šarru, “gods and king,” for
which see line 19. The prayer returns to the theme of effective speech (see line 15), but
now lays emphasis on the supplicant’s personal deities. They wish the deities to be pleased
with what they say.
atmêya liṭīb eli ili u ištari
Line 19: Qabêya is a G inf. with a 1cs pronominal suffix. Epēšu, “to do, to make.”
Again the text brings up effective speech but now in terms of action rather than just recep-
tion (as in line 18). The supplicant explicitly requests that both god and king do whatever
they say.
ilu u šarru ša qabêya līpušū
Line 20: Pû, “mouth.” Lišānu, “tongue.” Pû u lišānu are metonyms for intercessory
speech or prayer (see CAD L, 211). Šutēmuqu (Št of emēqu), “to pray, to supplicate” (see
CAD Š/3, 400–401). The dative 1cs suffix on the verb indicates the beneficiary of the in-
tercession: the supplicant.
pû u lišānu lištēmiqūni
Line 21: What I have arranged as a single line here is actually composed of parts of
the previous and following lines (according to MS A) in Mayer’s edition. The first half of
our line is uncertain, though a vetitive, paralleling the second half, seems quite likely and
a verb from qerēbu plausible (see Seux, 277, n.25). KUR = kašādu, see line 16. The line
supplies the verbs for the following two lines that describe what the supplicant wants to
stay away.
ayy-iqribanni ayy-ikšudanni
Line 22: Mimma, “anything, everything.” Lemnu, “evil, bad, unfavorable.” NU DÙG . GA

concerning undesirable things generally before turning to a more specific problem in line

Line 23: Šunu, means “them,” but is probably best taken as emphasizing the following
word. Upīšu, “magical procedure,” usually occurs in the plural (just as šunu would lead us
to expect). But here it lacks the mp ending –ū; thus, it is a singular bound form. The word
governs the following two paired genitives. Kaššāpu, “warlock.” Kaššaptu, “witch.” As hap-
pens frequently in prayers, the machinations of the anti-social (black) magic of the witch
and warlock are introduced. In this case, they seem to be the main reason for the suppli-
cant’s problems. Mayer’s MS F further defines the upīšū of the witch and warlock as
kišpīšunu ruḫêšunu rusêšunu, “their witchcraft, black magic, and sorcery.” These three se-
mantically-related terms occur together rather frequently in witchcraft contexts.
u šunu upīš kaššāpi u kaššapti
Line 24: Tû, see line 13. TIN = balāṭu, “life, health.” The line reprises the invocation
used in line 13 (absent in Mayer’s MS F). This line reiterates its concern for the general evil
mentioned in line 22. The main verb of the sentence occurs in the next line of the text.
Ea ina têka ša balāṭi mimma lemnu mimma lā ṭābu
Line 25: Nêʾu, means “to turn back.” Irtu (pl. irātu), “breast, chest,” bears a 3mp pro-
nominal suffix (lacking the final vowel). The consonant cluster –tš– becomes –ss–. The
idiom irta nêʾu means “to turn back, to depart, to withdraw.” Although the supplicant has
already requested that nothing unfavorable reach them, they request now that Ea use his
incantatory speech to deflect the evil.
linēʾū irāssun
Line 26: Riksu, “binding, knot, bond,” here refers to the evil actions of the warlock
and witch. Puṭṭuru (D of paṭāru), “to loosen, to undo a knot.” Šiptu, “incantation, ritual
wording.” The “incantation of Eridu” stands for Ea. Again the supplicant appeals to the
effective word of Ea. The power of the supplicant’s enemies seems to be growing stronger.
First the supplicant wished that nothing evil would approach (21–23). Then the supplicant
requested that any and all evil be turned back (lines 24–25). Now it seems the evil powers
of the warlock and witch have a hold on the supplicant and they need to be undone.
rikis kaššāpi u kaššapti lipaṭṭir šipti ša Eridu
Line 27: ḪUL . MEŠ = lemnūtu, “evil things” (mp). For ABGAL , see line 4. Drawing on
previous lines, the supplicant now requests that Ea use Marduk, his son, to help the suppli-
cant get free of the magical machinations of the witch and warlock. This may allude to a
common motif in Sumerian incantations in which Ea and Marduk cooperate explicitly to
fight the problem addressed in the incantation (see Adam Falkenstein, Die Haupttypen der𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : E A 1 A

Line 28: Ebēbu, “to be(come) pure, bright,” but here “to be(come) clear (of illness).”
Minâtu, the plural of minītu, “limbs, body,” is often used in parallel to mešrêtu, “limbs” (see
CAD M/2, 88). Ṭâbu eli X here (as opposed to its meaning in line 18) means “to be in good
condition, to be sound, to be healthy.” A first person reference is finally mentioned explic-
itly again, absent in the prayer since line 21.
lībibā minâtūya mešrêtūya elīya liṭībā
Line 29: AN = šamû, “the heavens.” Ḫadû, “to be joyful.” The object supplies the
cause for joy. Râšu, “to rejoice.” See line 9 where Anu rejoices, using very similar words.
The parallel use of the heavens and the Apsû creates a merism: the entire universe is en-
couraged to give praise to Ea for his beneficence to the supplicant. This line begins a cre-
scendo of cosmic praise that concludes the prayer, replacing the otherwise ubiquitous
personal promise of praise: dalīlīka ludlul, “let me resound your praises.”
šamû liḫdūka Apsû lirīška
Line 30: Etelliš, “as a lord, in a lordly fashion.” The first sign of the word is uncertain.
Šūlulu (Š of alālu), “to celebrate, to laud.” The population of the heavens and the nether-
world (see line 29) are now drawn in to praise Ea. How etelliš functions in the sentence is
unclear. Does it describe the great gods (“in a lordly fashion they laud you”) or does it
further define the praise the great gods offer to Ea (“they laud you as a lord”)? The word is
almost always attested with verbs that deal with the body in motion or repose (standing,
going, entering, or sitting) and is most often attested with alāku (see CAD E, 380–81). Our
instance would seem to be the exception. The adjectival use of the cognate etellu as a de-
scription of speech (CAD E, 382), however, suggests a basis for understanding the use of
the adverb here with a speech-related verb. Moreover, in every instance of etelliš the word
modifies the subject’s action, designated by the verb. It seems most likely therefore that
the adverb is to be attached to the great gods’ activity of praise here. Mayer’s MS E con-
cludes the line with ilū rabûti libbaka liṭibbū, “may the great gods please your heart,” and
his MS F offers ilū ša kiššat likrubū-KI ! (for –ka) ilū rabûti libbaka liṭib-ŠU ! (for –bū), “may the
gods of the totality bless you, may the great gods please your heart.”
ilū rabûtu etelliš lišālilūka
Line 31: Dumqu, “good fortune.” The crescendo of praise grows more specific, naming
here the Igigî gods, for which see line 4 above, as representatives of the great gods in line

Line 32: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is
directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the
wording of a lifted-hand to Enlilbanda,” i.e., Ea. One MS of the text indicates the prayer is
directed at d en-ki, the Sumerian name for Ea. Another MS shows that it was directed to
d
amar-utu, Marduk. Unfortunately, this latter MS does not preserve anything before our
line 25, so we cannot ascertain how the text was adjusted to fit Marduk.
Line 33: The ritual instructions comprise a single line, preserved in only one MS . The
instructions begin without any indicator (such as DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual,” which is
used very frequently). The phrase we have here in line 33 is quite stereotypical and com-
monly attached to shuillas. It probably serves only as the catchphrase to a fuller ritual,
which the exorcist would recall and perform probably from memory (see Mayer, UFBG,
119, n.3). Lū . . . lū, “either . . . or.” KEŠDA = riksu, “ritual arrangement, assemblage of
offerings” (compare the usage here to those in lines 26 and 27 above). NÍG . NA = nignakku,
“incense burner.” DÙ = epēšu, “to do, to make.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Although our prayer offers several interesting possibilities for comparative
purposes, we focus here on two: the “hand-lifting” gesture accompanied by a
formal address found in all shuilla-prayers and the BH equivalents to the suppli-
cant’s first petitions in line 14.
Lines 1–12 of our prayer to Ea comprise a lengthy hymnic introduction,
which is of course a typical feature of shuilla-prayers. As discussed in the gen-
eral introduction, the hand-lifting gesture along with its verbal component of
honored address was a complex formal gesture of greeting in ancient Mesopota-
mia based on a master-servant relationship. When used with prayer, the complex
of gesture and formal address (i.e., hymnic introduction) “emphasized the com-
municative gesture . . . , a salutation signaling recognition of a reciprocal but
asymmetrical relationship between client and deity” (see page 35 of the general
introduction). Do we find a similar adaptation of such a greeting in the prayers
of the Hebrew Bible? Although the Bible does not show evidence of a special
kind of “lifted-hand” ritual-prayer, the Hebrew Bible does preserve attestations
in its prayers of the hand raising gesture and the formal mode of address (of
varying lengths) similar to the shuilla’s hymnic introduction. In light of the
comparative evidence, these texts display another facet of ancient Israel’s mas-
ter-servant model of divine-human relations.
Formal address dominated by praise is found at the beginning of several
biblical prayers in which individuals or a representative group pray on behalf of
the community. Note, for example, the brief hymnic introduction to a penitential𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : E A 1 A
239
prayer in Dan 9:4 and the longer ones to communal laments in Pss 44:2–9 and
89:2–19. Nehemiah 9, a penitential prayer like Dan 9, in which Levites stand
before the community and petition Yahweh to forgive the people’s sin, is a par-
ticularly interesting example. The prayer begins in v. 5b and ends in v. 37; the
introductory hymn occupies vv. 5b–32a! At the start of the prayer the Levites
address Yahweh in a manner that recalls the significance of Akkadian karābu
(BH cognate: ‫)ברכ‬ 1 to the hand-raising greeting (see page 35 of the general in-
troduction): ‫ינוּ‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ַ ‫רוְּך‬ ‫בּ‬,
“You are blessed, O Yahweh, our god” (v. 5b). 2
The hymn then goes on to praise Yahweh’s name, uniqueness, creative and sus-
taining power, and especially his historical dealings with Israel, from the exodus
to the speaker’s present day. This long account of the history between Yahweh
and Israel also brings out Yahweh’s character: his compassion, long-suffering,
forgiveness, and willingness to discipline his people rather than to forsake them.
The entire hymn is prelude to the relatively brief petition in vv. 32b–37.
Although we see the formal address in this long opening hymn, we of course
do not see the hand raising gesture. The opening statement about Yahweh’s
blessedness, however, may be enough to suggest hand-raising lies in the pre-
sumed background for both the author and their early readers. This is a plausi-
ble presumption in light of passages like Ps 134:1–2, “Bless Yahweh, all (you)
servants of Yahweh . . . lift up your hands . . . bless Yahweh!” (‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֲ ‫בּ‬ ָ
‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֲ ‫וּב‬
. . . ‫ם‬ ‫כ‬ ֶ ‫ד‬ ֵ ְ‫אוּ־י‬ ‫שׂ‬ ְ . . . ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫ד‬ ֵ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫ל־ע‬
‫)כּ‬,
and Ps 63:5, “I bless you . . . I lift up
my hands” (‫י‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ֶ . . . ‫ָך‬ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ב‬ ֲ ‫)א‬.
3 As these texts suggest, the hand-raising gesture
is closely aligned with offering blessing (or praise) to the deity. It is also associ-
ated with petitionary prayer in other passages. Note, for example, how Ezra lifts
his hands in prayer (‫י‬ ‫פּ‬ ַ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ‫שׂ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫)א‬
in Ezra 9:5, a third penitential prayer (though
this prayer lacks a hymnic introduction). Solomon does the same in 1 Kgs 8:22
( ‫יו‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫כּ‬ ַ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ), where introductory praise accompanies the gesture (vv. 23–24) and
precedes the petition (vv. 25ff. ). 4
If our comparative material is at all instructive, we should look at each of
these biblical contexts in similar terms as the audience model described for the
Mesopotamian shuilla-prayer: a supplicant reaches out to a social superior for

Tawil, ALCBH, 58.
This reading, which assumes continuity between vv. 5 and 6, requires a slight emendation to
the MT , which reads: ‫ם‬ ‫יכ‬ ֶ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֲ ‫ב‬,
“Bless Yahweh, your god.” See H. G. M. Williamson,
Ezra, Nehemiah (WBC 16; Waco: Word, 1985), 303–4. For a different understanding, see Joseph
Blenkinsopp, Ezra-Nehemiah: A Commentary (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1988), 296,

8:54 and Lev 9:22.

for the gesture in a context of
supplication. The hand-raising gesture is also reflected farther afield in 1 Tim 2:8. For a fuller
discussion of the various phrases in Biblical Hebrew that denote the hand-raising gesture and
reflection about how each relates specifically to praise and/or supplication, see Mayer I. Gruber,

Institute Press, 1980), 25–44.
2240help, greeting the one petitioned via a conventional gesture and formal address
that recognizes the superior’s higher position in relation to the supplicant. In this
manner, the supplicant hopes to establish a favorable relationship with the one
petitioned and thereby obtain a positive answer to their request. It is interesting
that we do not see the hand-lifting gesture or lengthy formal address in either
the dingirshadibba-prayers to personal gods or biblical laments of the individual.
For reflections on this latter point, see page 442.
In the prayer’s first line of petitions (line 14) the supplicant says, “raise my
head, call (my) name!” (ulli rēšīya ibi šumu). These two idioms have equivalents
in BH. Before we make any comparisons, however, we should recognize that “to
raise the head” and “to call a name” have more than one meaning in both Akka-
dian and BH (see CAD N/2, 107–8 and HALOT, 1164–65 for the former and CAD
N/1, 33–37 and HALOT, 1129 for the latter). The sense of rēša ullû in our Akka-
dian prayer is something like “to take notice with favorable intention.” The same
sense for the BH cognate phrase ‫ֹאשׁ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫נשׂא‬ occurs in 2 Kgs 25:27 ( Jer 52:31),
where Jehoichan is shown mercy by the Babylonian king Evil-merodach, and
Gen 40:13, where Joseph informs the Pharaoh’s chief cupbearer that the Phar-
aoh will restore him to his former position. 5 Šuma nabû in our prayer has the
sense of summoning or appointing a person for a particular position or standing.
The same meaning is found in the BH idiom ‫ם‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫קרא‬. See, for example, Exod
31:2, 35:30, Josh 21:9 (where it is used as a means to allocate land; see also 1
Chron 6:50), Isa 40:26, 43:1, 45:3, 4, and Isa 49:1, where the idiom is broken up
across the line’s poetic parallelism. These idioms demonstrate once again the
significant cultural (including religious) continuity between ancient Israel and
ancient Mesopotamia despite their many differences.
5
Note, however, that the idiom “to raise the head” is also used later in the narrative (Gen 40:19,
31) in other senses, rather literally, as in “the Pharaoh will raise your head from upon you”
(‫יָך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫;מ‬
v. 19), and in the idiomatic sense, “to summon” (v. 31).

A Shuilla: Gula 1a
A LAN L ENZI
G ULA :
Gula was a mother goddess from the Babylonian city of Isin and one of the
high gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon. According to various traditions Gula
was the daughter of An and Urash, the wife of Ninurta or Pabilsag, and the
mother of Damu and Ninazu. Gula is attested already in third millennium texts
(perhaps as early as the ED period in Fara) and persists in the Mesopotamian
pantheon until Hellenistic times. By the OB period Gula had already been identi-
fied with and worshipped as the goddesses Ninisina, Nintinugga, Ninkarrak,
Gunura, and Baba, among others. As the azugallatu, “the chief physician,” Gula
was closely associated with healing and the patron deity of the asû, “physician.”
She was also the patron god of dogs and associated with the dog in iconogra-
phy. 1 Given her power over disease, Gula was sometimes invoked in curse for-
mulae to bring illness upon transgressors (see, e.g., SAA 2, no. 6, §52).
Gula’s main temple, É-gal-maḫ, “the exalted palace,” was in Isin, but she
had temples and shrines—sometimes more than one—in many other cities (e.g.,
Ashur, Babylon, Borsippa, Nippur, Lagash, Larsa, Umma, Ur, and Uruk). Excava-
tions at cultic sites in Isin, Nippur, and Sippar have revealed dog and human
figurines as well as models of body parts. 2 Some of the dog figurines seem to be
apotropaic or petitionary in nature, but others were clearly placed as thanksgiv-
ing votives to Gula for help received. 3 The human figurines probably represent
individuals. The varied hand placement of these figurines upon their body may
have been intended to indicate the part of the sufferer’s body that was afflicted.
The temples of Gula were also a center for storing and copying texts associated
with the healing professions. Tablets have been found in her temple at Isin, and
colophons mention tablets being copied from an original stored at a temple of
Gula (see, e.g., Hunger, BAK, nos. 199[d], 203[k], 380).

Gula’s temple is called the É-ur-gi 7 -ra, “the dog house,” in some texts, and thirty-three dog
burials were uncovered near Gula’s temple in Isin. See Avalos, 210–12 and references there.

243244Gula’s star was Lyra and her canine representation is associated with our
constellation Hercules. One of the most important first-millennium texts associ-
ated with the goddess is a two-hundred-line hymn that alternates between a
description of Gula and her spouse, Ninurta. 4
T HE P RAYER :
The prayer may be divided into three sections: the introduction (lines 1–
10), the petition section (lines 11–24), and the promise of praise (line 25).
Lines 1–10 form the introductory section of the prayer. An invocation and a
mere three epithets (line 1) lead directly into what Mayer calls the “turning”
(Hinwendung; see UFBG, 122–49) in lines 2–3. Here the supplicant explicitly
seeks the goddess’s attention with first person verbs and demands (note the im-
peratives) that she be present and listen to the prayer. The supplicant gives rea-
sons for turning to Gula in lines 4–6. Since all of these reasons concern the func-
tional domain of the goddess (and recall hymnic epithets found elsewhere), we
may also consider these lines a kind of implicit praise of the goddess, continuing
what the prayer started in line 1. Lines 7–8 reprise the invocation and praise of
the goddess with three epithets, repeating or paralleling line 1. These lines lead
into lines 9–10, where the supplicant turns to the deity again, using first person
verbs, and demands her attention, using imperatives (compare lines 2–3). The
mixture of invocation, hymnic elements, and explicit requests for the goddess’s
attention prepares the way for the petition section of the prayer in lines 11–24.
The petition section can be divided into three parts, lines 11–19, which con-
cern the angry personal and city deities; lines 20–22, which deal with Marduk;
and lines 23–24, which make a final general plea. The supplicant begins in lines
11–12 by wishing to send Gula to intervene on their behalf with their angry per-
sonal and city deities (the lušpurka formula; see UFBG, 236–39). Although the
problem of angry deities is worked into this first petition proper rather than
stated as an independent complaint, its ramifications are clearly expressed in the
complaint that follows in lines 13–14: the supplicant is afraid due to evil oracles
and dreams. Having expressed a desire to send Gula, the supplicant now spells
out in lines 15–19 exactly what they want her to do. By the power of her divine
word, the supplicant requests that she restore their troubled relationship with
their protective deities. As if to emphasize its importance, the supplicant prefac-
es this second petition proper with another reprised invocation in line 15 (see
line 1 and compare line 7). The same invocation is repeated in line 20, the open-
ing of the second part of the prayer’s petition section.
In a somewhat surprising turn of events, the supplicant now requests that
Gula also intercede with Marduk (line 21–22a) and put in a good word on the
supplicant’s behalf (line 22b). The precise reason for this second intercessory
4
See W. G. Lambert, “The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi,” Or n.s. 36 (1967), 105–32 and plates
VIII–XXIII.𒌋𒐼 A S HUILLA : G ULA 1 A
245
petition is unclear, but Gula’s role as an intermediary goddess is attested else-
where. One could imagine the cooperation between the human asû, “physician,”
and āšipu, “exoricist,” suggested the cooperation between Gula, patron of physi-
cians, and Marduk, a god closely associated with magic. 5 In any case, the com-
parison of Gula to a personal god in line 3 has foreshadowed her intermediary
role here.
The petition section ends with one final, general petition for Gula to protect,
forgive, and provide well-being for the supplicant. This last petition leads into
the promise of praise in line 25.
Two major elements in the prayer give its text a sense of unity. The first
among these is the repeated invocation in structurally significant locations, lines
1, 15, and 20. 6 The latter two instances introduce a part of the prayer in which
the supplicant asks Gula to intercede with another divine power on their behalf.
The repetition of the invocation in these places maintains the prayer’s focus on
Gula, even while Gula’s attention is directed elsewhere. Another unifying ele-
ment is the thematic prevalence of mercy and intercession. This is most obvious-
ly manifested in the repetition of the word rēmēnītû/rēmēnû, “merciful,” in lines
1, 7, and 21. But one can also see the theme in the “hem of the garment” image-
ry of line 3, the string of infinitives in lines 5–6 (bulluṭu, šullumu, eṭēru, gamālu,
and šūzubu), 7 and the two-fold use of the idiom abbūta ṣabātu, “to intercede,” in
lines 20 (as an epithet for the goddess) and 22 (as an imperative).
Although the prayer is directed to Gula in the majority of MSS , three of May-
er’s MSS (B, E, and H) direct the prayer to a different goddess, Belet-ili (Bēlet-ilī).
These same three MSS also preserve an attalû formula within the prayer’s text,
though at different places in each. These variations in addressee and the content
demonstrate once again how shuilla-prayers could be adapted for various ritual
purposes. In addition to this, recent work on Bīt salāʾ mê has placed our prayer
in the ninth section of that ritual series among a number of other shuilla-prayers
(see Ambos).
5
For the intermediary role of Gula, see Avalos, 187–91, who mentions the parallel between the
cooperation of human ritual officials and that of the gods.

See also line 7 in Mayer’s MSS A and G.

Note the use in line 24, near the end of the prayer, of nouns cognate to two of these verbs
(gimillu, “requital,” cognate to gamālu and balāṭu, “life,” cognate to bulluṭu).246E SSENTIAL B IBLIOGRAPHY :

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” This word marks the beginning of the prayer. It is
not a part of the prayer itself. Three MSS (Mayer’s B, E, and H) direct this same prayer to
the goddess Belet-ili simply by substituting her name for Gula’s. GAŠAN = bēltu, “lady”
(but also šarratu, “queen”). Šurbūtu (fs), šurbû (m), “exalted, supreme,” is often used to
describe deities and their epithets (see CAD Š/3, 341–42). The Š stem verbal adjective is
used here as an elative (i.e., superlative), “most exalted.” The form is not to be confused
with the infrequently occurring noun šurbûtu, “greatness, exaltedness.” The TUM sign may
also be read as tu 4 , indicating SB Akkadian’s loss of mimation. AMA = ummu, “mother.”
Rēmēnītû (f), rēmēnû (m), “merciful,” is also frequently used to describe deities and their
epithets (see CAD R, 238). Compare this epithet to Marduk’s on page 296. (W)ašābu, “to
dwell, to sit.” The participle is functioning substantively, in apposition to the other epi-
thets in the line. AN = šamû, “heavens,” is always plural. KÙ = ellu, “pure, clear.”
Gula bēltu šurbūtu ummu rēmēnītû āšibat šamê ellūti
Line 2: šasû, “to call out to, to shout.” The G preterite form of the verb, išsi (3cs),
often becomes ilsi in later Akkadian. Alsi is a 1cs preterite. MU = 1cs pronominal suffix.
Izuzzu, “to stand.” The suffixed –m on the verb is the ventive morpheme. Šemû, “to hear, to
listen to.” Yâti, “to me.” The supplicant interrupts the string of epithets to request Gula’s
attention directly with performative verbs, the speaking of which executes their ritual
actions (i.e., “I hereby call to you”). The imperatives demand Gula’s presence and atten-
tion. This and the following line illustrate a common rhetorical move in Mesopotamian
prayers.

Line 3: šeʾû, “to seek out.” Saḫāru, “to turn.” GIM = kīma, “like, as.” TÚG . SÍG = sissik-
tu, “fringe, hem.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.” d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” Ṣabātu, “to seize.” The pray-
er builds on alsīki in line 2 with another three 1cs performative verbs. The last verb must
be understood metaphorically, unless we are to imagine the supplicant standing before the
divine image. Seizing the hem of a social superior’s garment was a symbolic gesture, in the
present case, of supplication (see CAD Ṣ, 18 and the discussion of the gesture on page 426,
line 15).
ešēki asḫurki kīma sissikti ilīya u ištarīya sissiktaki aṣbat
Line 4: Aššum, “because.” Dīnu, “(legal) case,” is the object of the infinitive (despite
the written case vowel). Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” EŠ . BAR = purussû, “(legal) decision.”
Parāsu, “to cut, to decide.” Both phrases in the line are cognate accusative constructions
(i.e., the verb and its object derive from the same root), creating a rhythmic and allitera-
tive line. Render both phrases idiomatically. The supplicant lays out in lines 4–6 the spe-
cific reasons for turning to Gula, a god who has the power to judge. Although these lines
provide supporting evidence for the supplicant’s turning, they use verbs that appear in
various hymnic epithets. They therefore should also be considered implicit praise for the
deity.
aššum dīni dâni purussâ parāsi
Line 5: Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to heal, to revive, to spare, to provide support for.”
Šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to keep well, to heal.” The infinitives are functioning as gerunds.
Bašû, “to be, to exist.” Itti, “with.” How would one translate “they are with you” idiomati-
cally? The supplicant has turned to Gula because she also has the power to heal and re-
store people to health.
aššum bulluṭu u šullumu bašû ittīki
Line 6: Eṭēru, “to save, to take away.” Gamālu, “to do a favor, to spare,” but see also
page 328. Šūzubu (Š of ezēbu), “to make someone leave, to rescue.” Idû, “to know.” Gula’s
knowledge described in this line is not abstract or theoretical; rather, it is functional. She
knows how to deploy actions that save, spare, and rescue people.

Line 7: The supplicant repeats the invocation, nearly repeating the first half of the
opening line. Šaqūtu (fs), šaqû (m), “elevated, prominent, sublime,” is often used to de-
scribe deities and their qualities (see CAD Š/2, 17–19). It is a near synonym of the adjec-2488. ina ma-aʾ-du-ti MUL . MEŠ šá-ma-mi

“stars.” Šamāmū, “heavens,” is a poetical equivalent of šamû. The reprised invocation con-
tinues, providing a semantic parallel to the second half of line 1. “Among the myriad stars
of heaven” is a way of describing Gula in the heavenly realm as she exists among her di-
vine peers. (Deities were associated with stars.)

Line 9: Kâši, “to you,” is redundant (perhaps emphatic) since the verb that follows it
(saḫāru, see line 3) also has a 2fs dative pronominal suffix. GEŠTU . II = uznā, “ears” (d).
When used with ears or eyes, bašû means “to be fixed on, to be attentive to” (see CDA, 40).
Mayer’s MS H (from Sippar) includes 8 very formulaic lines here (including a self-
presentation formula, the attalû-formula [see UFBG, 100], and a formulaic lament and
petition) in which Shamash-shum-ukin laments (as king, with Marduk and Zarpanitu as his
personal deities) on account of an evil eclipse (see UFBG, 452, n.79(4)).
bēltu kâši asḫurki ibšâki uznāya
Line 10: ZÌ . MAD . GÁ = maṣḫatu, “(a kind of) flour.” Maḫāru, “to accept, to receive.”
Leqû, “to take, to accept.” Unnīnu, “prayer, supplication.” The verb muḫrīnni has two ob-
jects, the one marked by the 1cs pronominal suffix and the word maṣḫata, “flour.” The two
objects should be understood as in apposition (thus, to receive the flour is to receive the
supplicant) and rendered in an idiomatic manner. The line contains a couple of stock
phrases in which the supplicant asks Gula to accept both the offering and the prayer. The
two imperatives in this line hark back to the two in line 2. The imperatives in line 10 pro-
vide the next step in the logical progression begun with the earlier imperatives: “stand
here and listen to me” (line 2) and “receive my flour offering, accept my prayer” (line 10).
One could even suggest that the actions of each imperative are collated via their position
in their respective lines, with the first ones showing movement from one to the other and
likewise the second ones: “stand here, receive my flour offering” (2a, 10a); “listen to me,
accept my prayer” (2b, 10b). Together these requests form a ritual prelude for the personal
and therefore more important petitions (from the supplicant’s perspective) that follow in
the next several lines.
maṣḫata muḫrīnnī-ma leqē unnīnīya
Line 11: Šapāru, “to send.” Zenû (m), zenītu (f), “angry.” The supplicant wants to send
Gula to their personal deities to intercede on their behalf. For a discussion of the personal
god in Mesopotamia, see page 431.

Line 12: URU = ālu, “city.” The words šabsu and kamlu are predicative constructions
in a subordinate clause (note the ša). When the subjunctive –u is added to the 3ms predica-
tive forms (šabis and kamil), the short i-vowels reduce. Both words mean “is angry.” Be-
sides the personal gods, the supplicant also wishes to send Gula to the city god. Mayer’s MS
E includes a fragmentary attalû–formula after this line (see UFBG, 453, n.82(5)).
ana il ālīya ša šabsū-ma kamlu ittīya
Line 13: Ina here means “as a result of, on account of.” Bīru, “the answer received
through divination, an oracle.” Šuttu, “dream.” Given the following verb, both singular
nouns are probably to be understood as collectives. Itaškunu (Ntn of šakānu), “to occur,
arise continually” (said of signs); see CAD B, 265 for a near parallel. The verb is in an
unmarked relative clause (i.e., there is no ša) and does not take a subjunctive ending (–u)
due to the presence of the ventive –am. The text begins a new sentence in line 13, which
gives the reasons for the states of mind described in line 14. Mayer’s MS E includes a one
line self-presentation formula and a truncated attalû-formula here (see UFBG, 453,
n.83(4)); both formulae are similar to what MS H adds after line 9, only they are shorter
here and use generic name and date “placeholders” ( NENNI ).
ina bīri u šutti ittanaškanam-ma
Line 14: Palāḫu, “to fear, to be afraid.” There are two homonymic roots in Akkadian
that have closely related meanings, adāru A or I and B or II (according to the CAD or
CDA). The first means “to be dark, to be worried.” The second means “to be afraid.” De-
termining which root is used in a specific context is difficult sometimes (see CAD A/1,
107–8 and 109). Despite the CAD listing our line under adāru B, its own criteria (A/1,
107–8) would suggest adāru A for our case, in which psychological trauma rather than
religious awe is paramount. The form of the verb is a Gtn, “to be anxious, worried con-
stantly.” The doubled second letter of the root (–dd–) is nasalized in our example, thus
atanamdaru. The final –u is superfluous, perhaps inserted under the influence of the 1cs
predicative ending of the first verb in the line. A subjunctive is not called for.
palḫākū-ma atanamdaru
Line 15: The first part of the line recalls the opening of line 1 in another reprise of the
initial invocation (see also line 7). Amātu (awātum), “word.” Qibītu, “speech, command.”
Ṣīru (m), ṣīrtu (f), “exalted, august.” É-kur was Enlil’s temple in Nippur. Šurbât is a 3fs
predicative related to šurbūtu, “exalted, supreme,” earlier in the line (and in line 1). This
line and the next comprise a long vocative address, directing the wishes (third person
precatives) expressed in lines 17–19 to Gula’s attention. The first ina in this line governs a
rather complex prepositional phrase that includes the rest of line 15 and all of line 16. The
ša introduces a short relative clause that futher defines Gula’s authoritative word.

Line 16: Annu, “consent, approval.” The relative clause modifies Gula’s consent and
grammatically parallels the relative clause in line 15. Kīnu, “firm, true.” NU = lā, “not.”
BAL = enû, “to change, to alter.” The inf. expresses the permanence or unchangeable quali-
ty of the deity’s word (see CAD E, 175), a common motif in Mesopotamian texts.
u annīki kīnim ša lā enû
Line 17: Târu, “to return, to turn back.” Nasḫuru (N of saḫāru), “to turn back, to turn
again with favor to.” Note the ventive on both verbs. The supplicant, having gotten Gula’s
attention in the previous lines, now begins expressing desires of reconciliation with their
angry deities (named earlier in lines 11 and 12).

Line 18: This line repeats line 12 nearly verbatim.
il ālīya ša šabsū-ma kamlu ittīya
Line 19: Ezēzu, “to be(come) angry, to be in a rage.” Nâḫu, “to rest, to relent.” Agāgu,
“to be(come) furious.” Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled, to be
soothed, to forgive.” Ezēzu and agāgu occur together frequently (see CAD E, 427 for other
examples). The line consists of two grammatically and semantically parallel parts. One
might even suggest a certain phonological similarity between the two as well. As with the
personal gods, the supplicant makes known to Gula their desire for reconciliation with
their angry city god.
ša īziza linūḫa ša īguga lippašra
Line 20: Ṣabātu means “to seize” and abbūtu, “fatherhood, a fatherly attitude.” When
used together the idiom abbūta ṣabātu means “to intercede for someone, to help someone’s
cause” (see CAD Ṣ, 24–25). Despite the masculine connotation of the literal meaning of the
words, the idiom may be applied to gods or, as here, goddesses (see also line 22). Enšu,
“weak, powerless,” is used substantively. A fourth invocation echoes line 1 in the first part
of the line. The second part contains an epithet, which may be interpreting line 1’s
rēmēnītû. In any case, it illustrates Gula’s mercy and concern for the less fortunate.

Line 21: d AMAR . UTU = Marduk (on whom, see page 291). LUGAL = šarru, “king.” EN =
bēlu, “lord,” the masculine form of bēltu, used throughout the prayer. Rēmēnû, “merciful,”
for which see line 1. Marduk is being described with many of the same words used for
Gula earlier in the prayer.
ana Marduk šarri ilī bēlu rēmēnû
Line 22: Qabû, “to speak.” Damiqtu, “favorable, good,” is used substantively (“some-
thing favorable”). See CAD A/1, 50 for a similar line with 3ms pronominal suffixes on the
substantives. In the first half of the line the supplicant appeals to Gula’s merciful nature,
brought out already in line 20 with the same idiom as used here and earlier in lines 1 and
7, where the supplicant invokes caring parental imagery (“merciful mother”). In the sec-
ond half of the line the supplicant appeals to Gula’s effective word for a favorable pro-
nouncement (see lines 15 and 16). In both parts of the line, the supplicant asks Gula to
present the supplicant in a good light before Marduk. The assumption seems to be that
Marduk will have the power to set things right.
abbūtī ṣabtī qibî dameqtī
Line 23: Ṣulūlu, “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor of divine or royal protec-
tion (see CAD Ṣ, 243). Rapšu, “wide.” Tayyartu, “forgiveness” (tajārtu). Kabtu, “heavy,
important, noble, honored.” Bašû, see line 5. The ending –nim is a 1cs dative suffix. This
line brings to the goddess’s attention that her intercession with Marduk on the supplicant’s
behalf would demonstrate her protection and forgiveness for him. In other words, the
requested action in lines 21–22 and the requested relationship in line 23 are two sides of
the same coin.
ṣulūlki rapšu tayyartūki kabtu libšanim-ma
Line 24: Gimillu, “requital, a return in kind, a friendly deed.” Dumqi, “goodness, pros-
perity.” Balāṭu, “life.” UGU = eli, “on, upon, on to.” Šakānu, “to put, to place, to provide.”
The supplicant makes one final, summarizing plea to Gula, which recognizes her actions—
her acceptance of their prayer and successful intercession with Marduk on their behalf—as
the key to future happiness and prosperity.
gimil dumqi u balāṭi elīya šuknī-ma
Line 25: Narbû, “greatness.” Šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to proclaim, to announce.” Dalīlū,
“praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is,
the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomatically, “let me25226. ka-inim-ma šu-íl-lá d [g]u-la-kám

Line 26: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is
directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the
wording of a lifted-hand to Gula.”
Line 27: The ritual is fragmentary. The present text is based on Mayer’s MS G, but is
not in his edition. Other MSS deviate from this one. DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” These
words alert the user of the tablet that the ritual instructions follow. Compare the ÉN at the
beginning of the prayer. IGI = maḫru, “front,” or pānu, “face.” According to Mayer, maḫru
is the more likely reading for ina/ana IGI (see UFBG, 175–76). In any case, the meaning is
the same. KEŠDA = riksu, “ritual arrangement, assemblage of offerings.” Rakāsu, literally,
“to bind, tie up,” but in ritual instructions the word means “to prepare, to set out (offer-
ings).” The other verbs in the ritual instructions should be understood as second person
verbs, too. KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” SAG = rēšu, “top, head, best.” Šikaru rēšu designates first-
rate beer, a very common item to libate. BAL = naqû, “to pour out, to libate, to sacrifice.”
epuštašu: ana maḫar Gula riksa tarakkas . . . šikara rēša tanaqqi
Line 28: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” Annītu, “this.” 3 -šú = šalāšīšu, “three times.” ŠID =
manû, “to recite, to count.” Teslītu, “petition, request.” Nešmû (N of šemû), “to be heard.”
The final phrase indicates to its user that the ritual-prayer will be successful.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In line 8 we learn that the goddess exists “among the myriad stars of the
heavens” (ina maʾdûti kakkabī šamāmī). The close association of Mesopotamian
gods and stars is well-known among contemporary scholars. 1 For example, Gu-
la’s star is Lyra and her constellation is the one we call Hercules. This close con-
nection between stars and gods is enshrined in the cuneiform writing system: the
divine determinative (DINGIR) looks like a star in the earliest pictographic forms
1
The ancient Hebrew scribes were aware of the Mesopotamian connection, too. See, e.g., Amos
5:26 and the comments on this passage by Shalom Paul, Amos: A Commentary on the Book of
Amos (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991), 194–97. See also my comments below on the “host of
heaven.”𒌋𒐼 A S HUILLA : G ULA 1 A
253
of the script. 2 Given this, it is worth considering whether or not there is a similar
relationship between divinity and stars in the Hebrew Bible. 3
Akkadian kakkabu is etymologically related to the BH word ‫ב‬ ‫כּוֹכ‬,
pl. ‫ים‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ‫כּוֹכ‬.
Like Akkadian, this word usually designates the innumerable group of small
celestial objects that are visibly dimmer than the sun and the moon (see, e.g.,
Gen 37:9, Ecc 12:2). The Hebrew word “host” (‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫—)צ‬a
term closely associated
with the military (both in terms of the army, e.g., Num 2:8, and its activities,
e.g., Num 31:14)—and the phrase “host of heaven” ( ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫צ‬ ְ ) were used as
collective designations for all the stars in the heavens (see, e.g., Isa 45:12, Deut
4:19).
There is some indication in the Hebrew Bible that stars were believed to be
divine beings that could influence the events on earth. Judges 5:20, where stars
fight from heaven against Sisera, is perhaps the best example of such an idea. 4
Stars were therefore venerated as deities both individually as, for example, the
“queen of heaven” (‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ‫כ‬ ֶ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫)מ‬,
identified as Ishtar—our Venus, in Jer 7:18 and
44:17–19, and collectively as the “host of heaven” (‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫)צ‬
in, for example, 2
Kgs 17:16, 21:3, 5, Jer 19:13, and Zeph 1:5. Some scholars have suggested this
astral worship was a direct result of Assyrian and then Babylonian influence. 5 In
any case, all such worship was illicit and condemned repeatedly by biblical au-
thors (see the previous references and, e.g., Deut 17:2–5, 2 Kgs 23:4–5, Job
31:26). In fact, Deut 4:19 informs the Israelites that Yahweh gave the worship of
celestial bodies to other nations, not to Israel.
Although the Hebrew deity’s dwelling was in the heavenlies (Ps 103:19), as
high as the stars (Job 22:12, Isa 14:13), it is significant that Yahweh himself is
never described as a star in the Hebrew Bible. Rather, Yahweh is always consid-
ered superior to anything in the celestial sphere. The stars and the heavenly
host, for example, are often said to be created or counted or in some way con-
trolled by Yawheh (e.g., Gen 1:16, 2:1, Ps 8:4, 136:9, 147:4, Jer 31:35, Job 9:7
[see v. 9], Ezek 32:7, Isa 13:10, 40:26, Joel 2:10, 15 [and see Amos 5:8 and Job
38:31–32, which name particular stars]). In Ps 148:2–4 celestial bodies offer
praise to Yahweh; in Neh 9:6 the host of heaven bow down to him, their creator;
and in Job 25:5 the stars are said to be impure compared to the Hebrew god.
Yet Yahweh’s royal retinue, his servants that surround him in the divine as-
sembly, is sometimes identified as the heavenly host (1 Kgs 22:19, 2 Chron
2

ical Society, 1995), 1–7.
3
See F. Lelli, “Stars,” DDD, 809–15 and H. Niehr, “Host of Heaven,” DDD, 428–30 for useful
surveys in this matter, with references to other relevant resources.
4
Another important context for seeing the connection between stars and divinity is Isa 14:12–
15, where a divinized king’s hubris is punished by Yahweh with expulsion from among the stars.
See Mattias Albani, “The Downfall of Helel, the Son of Dawn: Aspects of Royal Ideology in Isa
14:12–13,” in The Fall of the Angels (ed. Christoph Auffarth and Loren T. Stuckenbruck; Themes
in Biblical Narrative; Leiden: Brill, 2004), 62–86.
5
See, e.g., Lelli, “Stars,” 811.25418:18; and note Ps 103:20–21 and 148:2, where ‫יו‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫צ‬,
“his hosts,” and ‫יו‬ ‫כ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ָ ְ‫ל‬ ‫מ‬,
“his messengers,” are in parallel) or stars (see Job 38:7, where ‫ר‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֶ ‫ב‬ ‫י‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ‫כּוֹכ‬,
“morn-
ing stars,” and ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫ל־בּ‬
‫כּ‬,
“all the sons of god,” are in parallel). Yahweh stands
over these lesser divine beings (who are apparently not gods) as their king (Ps
103:19–21).
Yahweh himself was therefore not closely associated with a particular star
as was Gula; rather, he was the creator (Isa 40:26, Neh 9:6) and ruler of the ce-
lestial host (see Ps 89:6–9).

A Shuilla: Ishtar 2
“The Great Ishtar Prayer”
A NNA E LISE Z ERNECKE
I SHTAR :
See page 169.
T HE P RAYER :
The prayer Ishtar 2 is unique in its form, length, and transmission. Only one
of its six textual witnesses known in Akkadian preserves a subscription that clas-
sifies the prayer as a “prayer of the lifting of the hand” (šu-íl-lá). The present
treatment of the prayer follows this tablet exclusively, the only copy in which no
text is missing ( MS A in Zgoll’s edition). Its provenance is unknown. The tablet is
in the British Museum today (BM 26187). The colophon describes it as a votive
offering in the temple Esagila in Babylon, being the copy of an original from
Borsippa. Two copies of the prayer were found in Boğazköy, one of them in Ak-
kadian ( MS F in Zgoll), and a very fragmentary second one in Hittite. 1 Together
with a tablet from the Emar region containing Ishtar 10, 2 these tablets are the
only attestations of prayers from the second millennium that are later known as
shuillas, though neither this classification nor any other subscription is pre-
served in these early copies. 3 Despite the fragmentary state of the Akkadian text
from Boğazköy, it can be demonstrated that it contained a shorter version of the
prayer in which the praise of the deity was proportionally much more im-
portant. 4
The structure of the prayer can be established by correlating aspects of form
(the various uses of first, second, and third person voice, preponderance of nom-
inal clauses and/or predicative constructions versus imperatives and precatives)

257258and content. The beginning and the end of the prayer are formed by (hymnic)
invocations of the deity (lines 1–41, 103–105), the middle section is character-
ized by two petitions (lines 42–55, 79–102) framing a complaint (lines 56–78). 5
The first invocation (lines 1–41) contains epithets and sentences praising
Ishtar’s astral radiance, her power and prowess, and her cosmic and cultic im-
portance. This long section of praise culminates in the mentioning of Ishtar’s
function as righteous and pardoning judge (lines 25–26) and her attention to the
weak and sick (lines 40–41). Ishtar is the subject of inflected verbs only in these
two passages of the opening invocation. Throughout the invocation, the suppli-
cant approaches Ishtar in various ways: the address changes several times be-
tween third person and the more intimate second person voice.
The beginning of the first petition (lines 42–55) corresponds to the begin-
ning of the prayer: the supplicant mentions an act of invocation (line 42, com-
pare line 1) and characterizes themselves as weak and in pain, just after having
praised Ishtar’s saving of the weak and sick in general (lines 40–41). The main
aim of the first petition is to gain Ishtar’s attention and to pray for her for-
giveness (lines 45–50), as her wrath seems to be the most important reason for
their suffering (lines 45, 51–52).
The complaint (lines 56–78) describes the suffering of the supplicant and
the hostility of enemies and others. The state of the supplicant is compared to
natural phenomena (lines 62–64). The supplicant does not find fault in their
behavior, but feels to be treated as if they had neglected the personal protecting
deities (lines 67–68). The supplicant is separated from deities and humankind
and is already in the sphere of death (line 74). They are not active: in most cases
in which they are the subject, the verb is either intransitive or the form is a pre-
dicative construction.
The second petition (lines 79–102) is dominated by precise requests for Ish-
tar’s action and her care for the supplicant. They hope for an end of the disturb-
ance in their relations to both gods and humans. Only here do they mention
their guilt, but the terminology is comprehensive (lines 80–82). The supplicant
hopes for Ishtar’s intervention against enemies (lines 97–98) so that they them-
selves will be judged as a living demonstration of her might (lines 101–102).
The final section of invocation and praise (lines 103–105) forms the antici-
pated praise of the supplicant and the witnesses of Ishtar’s saving actions on the
supplicant’s behalf (compare lines 101–102). Most of the vocabulary is derived
from the beginning of the prayer (lines 1–5). Thus, the final praise forms an in-
clusio with the very beginning of the prayer. The ritual instruction demands the
5
The structure can also be analysed differently; compare Wright, 116; Reiner and Güterbock,
263; Mayer, UFBG, 28–29, n.60; Zgoll, 69. The differences are caused by transitional passages
leading from one main part to the next and by differing analyses of the overall structure of the
prayer (see Zernecke, 99–100). Mayer, UFBG, 28–29, n.60 characterizes Ishtar 2 as an atypical
shuilla because of its length, its elaborated structure, the repetitions of certain words and phrases
(“litaneiartig”) and the exceptional and partly literary motifs.𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

prayer to be recited three times (lines 109–110). Thereby, beginning and end
would merge. 6
Ishtar 2 is a very complex prayer with an elaborate structure. Only a few
aspects of the complex framework of references interlacing all parts can be men-
tioned here. The first lines of every part establish the mode of speech and the
main topic of the following lines. Furthermore, several “seams” are highlighted
by the use of terms for speech and prayer (lines 1, 42, 79–80). Also, the seman-
tic field of sight, face, care, and aversion pervades the prayer in different and
characteristic nuances. The relationship between Ishtar and the supplicant
changes in the course of the prayer. This can be shown best in the way the god-
dess is addressed: in both invocations, a variety of names is used (Ishtar, Irnini,
and Gushea) and—among others—the title bēlet, “lady.” In both petitions and in
the complaint, she is almost exclusively addressed as bēltī, “my lady,” thus ac-
centuating the personal relation between the supplicant and the goddess. 7 The
overall structure of the prayer can be described as approaching Ishtar for the
request that is reinforced by the complaint, and then withdrawing out of the
presence of the goddess. The ritual demanding the repeated recitation emphasiz-
es this circular structure. 8
No normalization of this text has been published so far. This is possibly not
without reason, as the written vowels frequently do not correspond to the stand-
ard grammar, especially at the end of the words. So every attempt to transcribe
the text “normalizes” it “away” from the textual witness. The normalization giv-
en here tries to follow the text.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, the superscription of the prayer, corresponding to the subscription
in line 106. Both superscription and subscription are not part of the prayer itself, but form
a frame for the text to be recited. Šiptu, derived from the same root as āšipu, the designa-
tion for the ritual specialist, is usually translated as “incantation” (CAD Š/3, 86). This
translation suggests a classification of the following text as “magical.” As the opposition of
“magic” and “religion” is obsolete, šiptu should be understood as a technical term for the
beginning of the text to be recited in a ritual. Compare Mayer, UFBG, 22–23 and Zernecke,
326. Sullû, a D preterite with suffix, “to implore, to pray to,” can be interpreted as per-
formative (Koinzidenzfall), Mayer, UFBG, 181–209. The same form occurs again in line 80
at the beginning of the second petition. Bēltu, “lady.” Iltu, “goddess.”
šiptu: usallīki bēlet bēlēti ilat ilāti
Line 2: Šarratu, “queen.” Šarrat is the expected bound form; the vowel at the end in
our text is unnecessary, which is not atypical in late Babylonian copies. Kullatu, “whole.”
Dadmū, “inhabited world.” Šarrati kullat dadmē is a construct chain. Šutēšuru (Št lex. of
ešēru), “to guide aright.” Tenēštu, “people, personnel,” pl. tenēšētu, “humankind.” The par-
ticiple, muštēširat, is used here to characterize Ishtar’s action towards humankind. In line
26 the objects of her guidance are the wronged and afflicted (compare ešēru in the G stem
in line 41), whereas in line 84 (imperative Št lex.) the supplicant uses it to ask her for
guidance.
Ištar šarrati kullat dadmē muštēširat tenēšēti
Line 3: d Irnini is an alternative name of Ishtar. Muttallu (muttellu), “noble.” The form,
muttallāti, is a 2fs predicative. This is the first time the goddess is addressed in the second
person. Rabû (m), rabītu (f), “big, great.” Ra-bat is problematic. As rabāt, the word may be
an unexpected fem. sg. form of the adj. bound to the following gen. (see CAD R, 37 and
the analogous leʾāt in line 32). Rabīt Igigî, “greatest of the Igigi,” is one of Ishtar’s epithets
(see page 112 for an example in an OB hymn). Alternatively, perhaps ra-bat is the 3fs pre-
dicative, rabât, “she is great,” but the change of person in the middle of the line seems
odd. Igigû is a general name for the gods of heaven, in contrast to Anunnakkū, who are the
gods of the netherworld (see Black and Green, 106; in Enūma eliš VI 69 the Igigû number
three hundred and the Anunnakkū six hundred whereas in VI 39–44, contradictorily, the
two groups both number three hundred).

Line 4: The predicatives continue in this line. Gašru, “powerful, very strong.” Malkatu,
“ruler (f), queen.” Šumu, “name.” Ṣīru, “exalted.” Ishtar’s name(s) are also praised in lines
15, 20, 22.
gašrāti malkāti šumūki ṣīrū
Line 5: Attī, “you” (fs). Nannartu, “luminary, light of the sky.” AN = šamû, “heaven”;
also in lines 20, 27, and 35. Interestingly, in lines 13 and 63, “heaven” is written syllabi-
cally as šá-ma-mi (gen. of šamāmū). But in both lines, this is not in the formula “heaven
and earth.” KI . TIM = erṣetu, “earth,” also in lines 13, 20, 27, 35. Zgoll, 61 classifies this
writing as pseudologographic or archaizing. Mārtu, “daughter.” d 30 = Sîn, the moon god
(see page 385). Qardu (m), qarittu (f), “heroic, valiant.” We expect qaritti here to be in the
nominative (qarittu), as in Zgoll’s MS C. The epithet mārat Sîn qaritti reappears as the last
words of the prayer in line 105.
attī-ma nannarat šamê u erṣeti mārat Sîn qaritti
Line 6: Ittabbulu (Gtn of [w]abālu), “to look after, to maintain, to serve; to control, to
steer.” Muttabbilat is the Gtn participle. GIŠ . TUKUL = kakku, “weapon.” Šakānu, “to put, to
place, to arrange.” Tuquntu (tuqumtu), “battle.”
muttabbilat kakkī šākinat tuqunti
Line 7: Ḫamāmu, “to gather, to collect.” Gimru, “totality, all.” Apāru, “to cover the
head, to wear on the head.” Agû, “crown.” Bēlūtu, “lordship.” Because of the varied mean-
ings of parṣu (also, line 15), “rite, ritual; temple office; divine authority, power, office;
symbol, insignia; authoritative decision, command, decree; custom, practice” (see CAD P,
195), the translations of this line differ widely. See Zgoll, 61.
ḫāmimat gimir parṣī āpirat agê bēlūti
Line 8: GAŠAN = bēltu, here a vocative; compare lines 29 and 104. Interestingly, this
title in this form is used only in the invocations. In the petitions and the complaint, bēltu is
always written with a first person pronominal suffix ( d GAŠAN . MU = bēltī, lines 43, 56, 59,
72, 73, 79, 93, 94). Bēltu is only written with a logogram when it is vocative. In all other
cases (genitive constructions), be-let is found (lines 1, 11, 27, 28, 30). Šūpû, “resplendent,
manifest.” Narbû, “greatness” (s), “great feats” (pl). UGU = eli, “on, over, above.” Kalû
(absolute, kala), “all.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.”

Line 9: MUL = kakkabu, “star.” Tanūqātu, “battle cry.” Šutamḫuṣu (Št lex. of maḫāṣu),
“to cause constant enmity” (see CAD M/1, 84). ŠEŠ = aḫu, “brother.” Mitguru, “harmoni-
ous.”

Line 10: Itaddunu (Gtn of nadānu), “to give constantly, repeatedly.” Itbāru, “friend,
colleague.” Compared to the rest of the text, this line is half as long as a normal line. But
on the tablet BM 26187, it is written as a whole line. Compare line 92, where the second
part of the line is erased.
muttaddinat itbāru
Line 11: Itburtu is a hapax legomenon. AHw, 263 (etpuru) derives it from apāru and
translates “mit Tiara geschmückt” (“adorned with a Tiara”), compare CDA, 136 (itpuru).
Zgoll, 62 explains the form as a Gt verbal adjective of abāru / ubburu, characterizing Ish-
tar’s strength; see CAD I/J, 295. The same meaning is assumed in the translations of Foster
(“Strong (?) one,” 601) and Stephens (“O mighty one,” 384). Tūšaru (tūšāru), “battlefield,
pitched battle.” Muttakkipu, “goring, knocking over” (based on the Gtn participle of
nakāpu). Zgoll, 62 identifies šá-di-ia as a late Babylonian writing for šadî, “mountains”
(gen.).
itburti bēlet tūšari muttakkipat šadî
Line 12: Gušea is an alternative name for Ishtar, related to the poem of Agushaya and
Ishtar’s function as goddess of war (see Zgoll, 62). Ḫalāpu, “to slip into,” but in the predic-
ative (as here, 3fs), “clad in.” Labāšu, “to clothe oneself”; predicative, “clothed with.”
Ḫurbāšu, “terror, frost.”
Gušea ša tuqunta ḫalpat labišat ḫurbāša
Line 13: Gamāru, “to bring to conclusion, to settle.” Šipṭu, “judgment, verdict,” is
mentioned again in line 73 as something the supplicant has witnessed and is a source of
his complaints. EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision.” Ûrtu ([w]uʾʾurtu), “command, commission.”
KI . TIM = erṣetu, compare line 5, also concerning the syllabical writing of šamāmū, “heav-
en,” which can be found twice in this text, always at the end of the line (lines 13, 63).

Line 14: Sukku, “shrine, chapel.” Ešertu, “shrine, chapel.” Nēmedu, “base,” as a desig-

RA . MEŠ is an enumeration, all nouns function as subjects of upaqqū and all of them are
probably to be analyzed as nom. plural. Kâši, “to you.” The verb puqqu, “to pay attention
to,” can be found again in line 79 at the very beginning of the second petition. In both
cases, Ishtar is the object. In line 79, the supplicant is the subject.
sukkū ešrēti nēmeda u parakkū upaqqū kâši
Line 15: Ēkīam, “where?” MU = šumu, “name,” see also line 22. Parṣu, see line 7.
Lines 15–17 all begin with ēkīam lā. This is not the only chain of lines beginning with the
same word or groups of words; in fact, it is one of the typical features of this prayer (see
lines 27–30, 46–50, 72–73, and 93–94). Note that only the repetitions in the first invoca-
tion have parallels in the version from Boğazköy (lines 15–16, 27–30).
ēkīam lā šumki ēkīam lā parṣūki
Line 16: GIŠ . ḪUR = uṣurtu, “drawing, plan,” in the plural, “ordinances” of the gods.
Note the figura etymologica with uṣṣuru (D of eṣēru), “to draw, to plan.” ŠUB = nadû, “to
throw, to lay down,” also of foundations. The translation “set up” follows Foster, 602. BÁRA
= parakku, see line 14.
ēkīam lā uṣṣurā uṣurātīki ēkīam lā nadû parakkūki
Line 17: The adjectives rabû and ṣīru, in 2fs predicative form here, are used several
times in correspondence to characterize Ishtar. Rabû can be found in lines 3, 17, 23, and in
line 100 in an intensified form (rabbû); see also rabû, the verb with the same root, in lines
18 (Š) and 34 (G). Ṣīru is equally used several times for Ishtar: lines 4, 17, 23, 103, and
104. Line 17 therefore structures the text by relating to the combination of both adjectives
in lines 3 and 4 and to line 23. Lines 17 and 23 are especially parallel; they form a frame
around the passage dealing with Ishtar’s exaltation (lines 18–22).
ēkīam lā rabâti ēkīam lā ṣīrāti
Line 18: Anum, the god of heaven, see page 217. Ellil, the god of wind. Ea, the god of
water, wisdom, and magic, see page 227. These three gods are the highest gods in the
Mesopotamian pantheon. Ullû (D of elû), “to raise, to elevate.” Ina, “in, among, at.” The
line consists of two clauses. Ina ilī stands between both and can be understood as part of
either. Šurbû (Š of rabû), “to make great, to aggrandize, to promote, to magnify.” Lines 18–
19 (in fact, through line 22) refer to Ishtar’s exaltation among the gods, which is also
known from a separate text: Blahoslav Hruška, “Das spätbabylonische Lehrgedicht ‘Inannas
Erhöhung,’” ArOr 37 (1969), 473–522. In this text, Ishtar is made the queen of heaven and
earth and receives supreme power. In the present context (lines 18–22) the structure of the
text changes: verbal clauses dominate.

Line 19: Šašqû (Š of šaqû), “to exalt, to elevate.” Napḫaru, “total, sum, entirety.” As
with ina ilī in line 18, ina napḫar Igigî can be understood as pertaining to both clauses in
the line. Šūturu (Š of [w]atāru), “to make surpass, to make excel.” Manzāzu (mazzāzu),
“position, rank, abode.”

tion, thought.” Râbu, “to shake, to tremble.”

Line 24: Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” refers to humankind. The imagery
comes from the simile of people as sheep in need of leadership. Nammaššû (nammaštû),
“moving things, animals, herds; settlement, people.” Qurdu (s), “heroism,” (pl), “heroic
acts.” Dalālu, “to praise, to glorify,” is interpreted in the translations as having two or
three subjects, with nam-maš-šu-ú te-né-še-e-ti as either a construct chain or as two nomina-
tives. The vowel ending of nam-maš-šu-ú makes the interpretation as construct chain more
probable. An interpretation as two nominatives cannot explain the ending vowel of te-né-
še-e-ti. The translation given here follows Zgoll, 50, in analyzing the two words as a con-
struct chain.

Line 25: Dīnu, “legal decision, lawsuit.” Baḫūlātu (baʾūlātu), “subjects, people,
troops.” Kittu, “truth.” Mīšaru, “justice.” Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” Lines 25 and 26 are
very important for the characterization of Ishtar in the first invocation: only here and in
line 40 is she the subject of inflected verbs, all of which are in the present (durative) in its𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

habitual function. Ishtar’s actions are described; her astral dimensions, cosmic importance,
or prowess in war are set aside: she is a righteous judge. Interestingly, lines 25–26 have no
parallel in the version from Boğazköy.
dīn baḫūlāti ina kitti u mīšari tadinnī attī
Line 26: This line is central for the connection between the first invocation and the
rest of the text. The verb Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to look at, to look favorably upon,” is
used for the first time to characterize Ishtar’s action as regards suffering. In line 40, she is
again subject of this verb. In the later parts of the prayer, the petition kīniš naplisīnnī-[ma],
“look faithfully upon me,” is repeated three times (lines 44, 54, 92); it is the most frequent
petition and is clearly related to the description of Ishtar’s actions in lines 26 and 40. The
second verb, šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to guide aright,” connects line 26 to the very be-
ginning of the prayer (line 2) and is also used at the end of the invocation (line 41) and in
a petition (line 84, see the note to line 2). Ishtar is helpful towards the ḫablu, the “wronged
person,” and the šagšu (verbal adj. of šagāšu “to kill, to slaughter”), here translated as “af-
flicted”—apparently a person in a life-threatening situation. Uddakam, “every day, forev-
er.”
tapallasī ḫablu u šagšu tušteššerī uddakam
Line 27: Lines 27–30 begin with aḫulap, “an exclamation used to express or to seek
compassion”; the word denotes both the mercy granted by a god or king or the petition for
such mercy (CAD A/1, 213–14; AHw, 22–23. See Zgoll, 75, n.164). Here aḫulap (with a 2fs
suffix and always followed by an address to Ishtar) is Ishtar’s answer to prayers, which is
praised by the supplicant. See the corresponding lines 45–50, which also begin with aḫulap
but this time with a 1cs suffix or as regens in a construct chain with this suffix. There, in
the first petition, the supplicant prays for Ishtar’s verbal action that they praise in lines 27–
30. Rēʾâtu (rēʾītu), “shepherd” (f). UN . MEŠ = nišū, “people.” Apâtu, “numerous, teeming.”
aḫulapki bēlet šamê u erṣeti rēʾât nišī apâti
Line 28: E-ana (E-anna) is the name of Ishtar’s temple in Uruk. Quddušu, “holy, con-
secrated.” Šutummu, “storehouse, treasury.” Ellu, “pure, clean, holy.” We expect the gen.
case ending on the last three words.
aḫulapki bēlet Eanna quddušu šutummu ellu
Line 29: See the notes to line 8. GÌR = šēpu, “foot”; II = the dual sign. Anīḫu (āniḫu),
“tired.” Lāsimu, “swift.” Both adjs. are used predicatively (3fp). Birku, “knee.” Like šēpu,
birku is a dual.

Line 30: Tāḫāzī (gen. pl.), “battles, combats.” bēlet tāḫāzī is a construct chain.
Tamḫārī (gen. pl.), “battles, combats”, is a second nomen rectum. Kalîšunu, “all of them,”
breaks the chain and is probably related to both recta.

Line 31: The MEŠ sign is actually a ME on the tablet; the exclamation point marks
the correction. Šūpūtu is the fem. sg. form of šūpû, for which see line 8. Labbatu (lābatu),
“lioness.” Kunnušu (D of kanāšu), “to subject, to force submission.” Sabsu (šabsu), “angry.”
Mukannišat ilī sabsūti is an important epithet for the course of the prayer because it corre-
sponds to several petitions: compare the use of sabsu in line 86 and the combination of
sabsu and kanāšu (D stem) in line 98 (Zgoll, 94; Zernecke, 149). In lines 31–33, Ishtar’s
rule over all humankind is detailed depending on their social rank.
šūpūtu labbat Igigî mukannišat ilī sabsūti
Line 32: Lēʾû (m), lēʾītu (f; also lēʾātu, see CAD L, 160), “powerful, capable.” Malku,
“prince.” We expect the oblique plural to be malkī. Ṣabātu, “to hold, to seize.” Ṣerretu,
“nose-rope,” was a rope tied to a ring that pierced the nose of an animal in order to con-
trol it. The same method was used on captive humans (see CAD Ṣ, 136–37 for a brief dis-
cussion). LUGAL = šarru, “king.”
lēʾāt kalîšunu malkū ṣābitat ṣerret šarrī
Line 33: Petû, “to open.” Pētât is a fs participle, bound form. Pusummu, “veil.” KI . SIKIL
= (w)ardatu, “girl, young woman.” This (and possibly line 39) is the only reference to
Ishtar’s otherwise prominent function as erotic goddess.
pētât pusummē ša kalîšina ardāti
Line 34: Nanšû (N of našû), “to be raised.” Nandû (N of nadû), “to be laid down.” The
first two words of the line can be understood as 3fs predicatives, uncontracted nanšeat for
expected nanšât and uncontracted nandiat for nandât (see GAG §102c). The content is diffi-
cult to understand. Since a reference to defeat is hardly probable in such a hymnic context,
an astral interpretation, relating to the different positions of the planet Venus, seems to be
most plausible (Zgoll, 50, n.130; Zernecke, 80, n.36). The CAD offers two other alterna-
tives. On the one hand, CAD N/2, 111 cautiously interprets the words as 2fs predicative
forms of našû and nadû and translates them with a military interpretation: “whether you
have been elevated or brought down, heroic Ištar (your warlike deeds are great).” CAD E,
379, 413, on the other hand, takes the words as forms of ešû and eṭû and translates, “(Ish-
tar) is disturbed, gloomy.”

Line 36: Ezzu (m), ezzetu (f), “furious,” is used substantively here. Qablu, “battle.” Lā
maḫār, “not confrontable, not opposeable; irresistible.” Qablu lā maḫār can be understood
as a frozen construction that was used as an adjective (see Burkhart Kienast, “qabal lā
maḫār,” JCS 29 [1977], 73–77). Alīlu (m), alīltu (f), “powerful,” is also used substantively.
ezzet qablu lā maḫār alīlat tamḫāri
Line 37: Akukūtu, “firebrand.” Ayyābu, “enemy.” Napāḫu, “to light up, to ignite.”
Šakānu, see line 6. Šaḫluqtu, “destruction, annihilation.” Ekdu, “furious, wild.”
akukūtu ša ana ayyābī napḫat šākinat šaḫluqti ekdūti
Line 38: Mummiltu is often used for Ishtar, but it is not clear from which root it is de-
rived. Two possibilities are discussed: mummillu, derived from mēlulu (“dancer, player,
actor”), would lead to a translation as “dancing Ishtar” (see CAD M/2 196 and Foster,
603). The alternative is a D participle of (w)amālu, “to veil, to darken, to eclipse,” but also
used in connection with scintillating stars (AHw, 1459). In this latter case the word can be
understood as being related to Ishtar’s astral aspect (“scintillating, glimmering”), see Zgoll,
51; Zernecke, 81, n.38. Puḫḫuru (D of paḫāru), “to bring together, to assemble.” Puḫru,
“assembly.”
mummiltu Ištar mupaḫḫirat puḫri
Line 39: NITA = zikaru, “male, man.” MUNUS = sinništu, “female, woman.” d Ištar is in
this case probably not the name of the goddess but the bound form of the noun ištaru,
“goddess.” Note the unequivocal instances of ištaru, “goddess,” in lines 67, 68, 86 (always
with ilu), which are also written with the determinative. Lamādu, “to learn.” Milku, “ad-
vice, counsel, plan.” Mamman, “somebody,” with neg. “nobody.”
ilat zikarī ištar / Ištar sinnišāti ša lā ilammadu milikšu mamman
Line 40: Ašru, “place.” The bound form, ašar, indicates that a subordinate clause fol-
lows (comprising one verb); the word may be translated as “wherever.” Balāṭu, “to live, to
be healed.” ADDA (LÚ X ÚŠ) = mītu, “dead, dead person.” Tebû, “to rise up, to get up.”
Marṣu, “sick, sick person.” As in lines 25–26, Ishtar here is the subject of an inflected verb,
the N stem of palāsu, as in line 25 (see the notes to lines 25–26). The designation of the26841. iš-ši-ir la i-šá-ru a-mi-ru pa-ni-ki

person who receives help as marṣu is interesting, as the supplicant uses šumruṣu, derived
from the same root and intensified in meaning, as a self-description only two lines later
(line 42; see also lines 47 and 66). In the complaint, they describe themselves as being
already in the sphere of death (line 74).
ašar tappallasī iballuṭ mītu itebbi marṣu
Line 41: Ešēru, “to be well, to thrive, to prosper.” Lā išaru is a substantive here, mean-
ing “the one who is not right.” Amāru, “to see, to look at.” The form of āmiru is a ms parti-
ciple, bound to pānū, “face.” An “overhanging” u on a participle in construct is not un-
common in SB Akkadian (see Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der
jungbabylonischen „hymnischen“ Literatur, 2 Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien
14/1–2; Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 2.41 for numerous examples). In lines 40–
41, at the end of the first invocation, Ishtar’s help for the afflicted is presented as eye con-
tact. The goddess’ gaze gives life (line 40); a look at the goddess puts one in order (line
41). The motif of eye contact between Ishtar and the supplicant is central throughout the
whole prayer.
iššir lā išaru āmiru pānīki
Line 42: Anāku, “I.” Šasû, “to call out.” Alsīki is a 1cs preterite and is to be interpret-
ed as performative (see line 1). Anḫu, “tired.” Šūnuḫu, “wearied.” Both adjs. come from
anāḫu. Šumruṣu, “suffering” (adj.). ÌR = (w)ardu, “slave, servant.” Referring back to line 1,
the supplicant mentions their act of praying at the beginning of the first petition (lines 42–
55; see the introduction to the prayer). There is no self-introduction in Ishtar 2, where the
supplicant has to mention their or their father’s name (see Mayer, UFBG, 46–58). Instead,
they introduce themselves in line 42 with their relation to Ishtar as her servant (aradki)
and as an afflicted person, therefore already identifying themselves as the afflicted who
receives the help of the goddess (lines 25–26, 40–41).
anāku alsīki anḫu šūnuḫu šumruṣu aradki
Line 43: A . MUR -in-ni-ma: Zgoll interprets this as an alternative (CVC for CC) writing
for amrīnnī-ma, which is a G fs impv. with a 1cs suffix and enclitic –ma. This is not unique
in the shuilla-prayers addressed to Ishtar (see Zgoll, 64, 189). d GAŠAN . MU = bēltī, see note
to line 8. Leqû, “to receive, to accept.” Unnīnu, “supplication, petition.” In correspondence
to the end of the invocation, the very first petition resumes the subject of eye contact: the
supplicant asks the goddess to look at them. The second petition mentions the actual pray-
er. It is a typical stock-phrase, repeated in line 82 (see Mayer, UFBG, 217).
amrīnnī-ma bēltī leqê unnīnīya
Line 44: Kīniš, “faithfully, truly.” Both petitions are typical (see Mayer, UFBG, 214,
216); both deal with the central motifs of the prayer: the eye contact (again: palāsu in the
N stem, here as an impv.; see the note to line 26) and the praying (teslītu, “prayer,” which𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

comes from the same root as sullû in lines 1 and 80). The petition kīniš naplisīnnī-[ma] is
repeated three times in this single prayer (lines 44, 54, 92). Šemû, “to hear.”
kīniš naplisīnnī-ma šimê teslītī
Line 45: See line 27. Both parts of the line are usual stock-phrases in petitions. Kabat-
taki lippašra appears also in lines 52, 96. See Mayer, UFBG, 226, 241. Kabattu, often in
parallel to libbu, “heart” (see lines 51–52), probably denotes the liver, but more often
“emotions, thoughts, mind, spirit” (CAD K, 11). This reflects the physiological observation
that the intestines react very strongly to negative situations (compare the use of “guts” in
English!). Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled, to forgive.” Lippašra is a
3cs precative with a 1cs dative suffix (–a).
aḫulapīya qibî-ma kabattaki lippašra
Line 46: SU = zumru, “body, person.” Nassu, “groaning, wretched.” Malû, “to be full.”
Although it looks like the infinitive, malû is a 3ms predicative with the subjunctive –u,
which has contracted with the i of mali. Ešû, “confused.” Dalḫu, “troubled, disturbed.”
Lines 46–50 are part of the first petition, but already they give information about the suf-
fering of the supplicant. It is interesting that most of the vocabulary is not reused in the
complaint (see Zernecke, 136).
aḫulap zumrīya nassi ša malû ešâti u dalḫāti
Line 47: Šumruṣu modifies libbīya despite the presence of a nom. case ending. Dimtu,
“tear,” is translated as plural, but it is singular; see also in line 50. Tānēḫu, “sighing, dis-
tress.”
aḫulap libbīya šumruṣu ša malû dimti u tānēḫi
Line 48: Note that the omina (têrtu, “omen,” pl. têrētu) are qualified in the same way
as the body in line 46 (nassu, ešû, and dalḫu).
aḫulap têrētīya nassāti ešâti u dalḫāti
Line 49: É = bītu, “house.” Šudlupu, “sleepless, troubled.” Nussusu (D of nasāsu), “to
lament, to wail, to moan.” ÉR = bikītu, “weeping, wailing, mourning.”
aḫulap bītīya šudlupu ša unassasu bikâti
Line 50: See note on line 47. Šutabrû (Št lex. of bitrû), “to continue, to persevere.”
Uštabarrû is a durative with subjunctive –u (see AHw, 123, sub berû/barû II and CAD B,
280, sub bitrû). Kabtatu (lines 50, 94) is an alternative form of kabattu (see line 45). The27051. d ir-ni-ni(one sign erased)-i-tu 4 la-ab-bu na-ad-ru lìb-ba-ki li-nu-ḫa

description of the suffering of the supplicant’s kabattu (lines 50, 66) corresponds to the
petitions concerning Ishtar’s kabattu (lines 45, 52, 94, 96).
aḫulap kabtatīya ša uštabarrû dimti u tānēḫi
Line 51: The interpretation of Irninītu (hapax legomenon) is dubious because of the
erasure. As the text is very diligently written and corrected (see lines 32, 82, and 92), it is
most probably to be considered as a form of Ishtar’s name Irnini (see lines 3 and 105).
Possibly, it is a mythical allusion (see Zgoll, 279). Labbu, “lion.” Nadru, “wild, aggressive.”
Nâḫu, “to (be at) rest, to calm down.” Linūḫa is a 3cs precative with a 1cs dative suffix.
This and the following line contain the first references to the supplicant as the object of
Ishtar’s wrath.
Irninītu labbu nadru libbaki linūḫa
Line 52: Rīmu, “wild bull.” Šabbasû, “very angry.” See also the notes to line 45.
rīmu šabbasû kabattaki lippašra
Line 53: SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f; see line 95), “good, kind.” IGI = īnu, “eye”;
with the dual sign. Bašû, “to be.” Eli, “on, over, upon.” This line and the following two,
which conclude the first petition, contain yet another reference to the eye contact between
supplicant and deity.
damqātu īnāki libšâ elīya
Line 54: Būnu, “goodness, outward appearance,” pl. “face.” Namru (nawrum), “bright,
shining.” See also the note to line 44.
ina būnīki namrūti kīniš naplisīnni yâši
Line 55: Ukkušu (D of akāšu), “to drive away, to expel.” upīšū, “magical procedures,”
is typically plural. We therefore expect upīšī here as the object of the impv. ḪUL = lemnu,
“bad, evil.” SU = zumru, see line 46. ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.” Lūmur is a 1cs precative from
amāru.
ukkišī upīša lemnūti ša zumrīya nūrki namru lūmur
Line 56: Adi mati, “how long?” The complaint (lines 56–78) is introduced by two
questions (lines 56 and 59); in the second petition, another two questions have the same
interrogative particle (lines 93–94). The seam of the text before line 56 is not stressed by
references to the act of praying (see lines 1, 42, and 79–80), but the theme of eye contact
is kept up, though it is now the malevolent regard of the enemies (nekelmû, “to frown at,𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

Line 58: Rēdû, “pursuer, persecutor.” Ḫādû, “one who rejoices, gloats,” is a person
who takes pleasure in another’s misfortune. UGU = eli. We find ištammarū here instead of
ištammurū, 3mp durative. The verb is the Gt of šamāru, “to be furious, to attack furiously,
to rage”; see Zgoll, 64.
rēdûya ḫādûya ištammarū elīya
Line 59: Lillu, “idiot.” Akû can mean “cripple” or “powerless, weak,” depending on
which of the two homonyms one accepts in the context. Bâʾu, “to walk, to go along, to
pass, to overtake, to defeat.”
adi mati bēltī lillu akû ibâʾanni
Line 60: Panû, “to go ahead, to be in front.” Muqqu, “wearied.” Arkû (warkû), “rear,

erite.

Line 62: Sabāʾu, “to rock, to toss about.” Agû, “wave” (compare the homonym in line

rative. Iṣṣūru, “bird.”

Line 64: Damāmu, “to wail, to moan.” Summatu, “dove, pigeon.” Mūšu, “night.” Urru,
“day.” The simile is a stock-phrase used in several prayers, see Mayer, UFBG, 83.
adammum kīma summatu mūši u urra
Line 65: The meaning of nangulāku (N 1cs predicative from nagālu) is uncertain; the
verb is used in two different contexts: with stars as subject or with expressions of emo-
tions, especially in complaints. Zgoll, 52, 65 translates as “glühend” (“glowing / burning”),
because of a possible reference to a symptom of an illness. See Zernecke, 83. n.45. Bakû,
“to weep, to cry.” Ṣarpiš, “bitterly.”
nangulākū-ma abakki ṣarpiš
Line 66: Ūʾa, “woe! alas!” Â (ai), “alas!” See also line 42.
ina ūʾa â šumruṣat kabattī
Line 67: Mīnâ (mīnu), “what?” Epēšu, “to do, to make.” In this line, the “third party
involved” is introduced, the supplicant’s personal protective deities. Ištaru with suffix is
here definitely not the principal addressee of the prayer but used as a noun for “goddess.”
Like Ishtar (see lines 51–52), the personal deities are angry, but the supplicant is not con-
scious of guilt or negligence (line 68). Foster, 604, understands the line as a direct address
to the personal deities. As they are obviously not addressed in the following line 68, this
singular change of direction of speech is improbable.
mīnâ ēpuš ilī u ištarī anāku
Line 68: Kī, “as, like.” Palāḫu, “to fear, to revere.” The 1cs predicative elides the final
vowel (epšēku becomes epšēk).
kī lā pāliḫ ilī u ištarī anāku epšēk
Line 69: Diʾu, “headache.” Ḫuluqqû (ḫuluqqāʾu), “loss.” Šaḫluqtu, see line 37.
šaknūnim-ma murṣu diʾi ḫuluqqû u šaḫluqti
Line 70: Pardāti: Zgoll, 46 reads per-da-a-ti; but as the first sign can also be read as
par, the word pardāti, a fem. plural. form of pardu, “afraid, fearful; frightening,” is also
possible. The adj. is used as a noun here, “terror, fright.” Suḫḫuru, “to turn away, toward.”𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

Libbātu, “rage, fury.” The infinitives are bound to the following nouns.
šaknāni pardāti suḫḫur pānī u malê libbāti
Line 71: Uzzu, “anger.” Uggatu, “rage, fury.” Sibsatu (šibsatu), “anger, angry rejec-
tion.” Amēlūtu (amīlūtu), “humanity.” This enumeration of further pains is also dependent
on šaknāni in line 70.
uzzu uggati sibsat ilī u amēlūti
Line 72: UD (or U 4 ) = ūmu, “day.” Ukkulu, “very dark.” ITI = (w)arḫu, “month.” Nan-
duru (naʾduru), “darkened, obscured, eclipsed.” MU = šattu, “year.” Niziqtu, “worry, grief.”
Again, the motif of seeing and eye contact is taken up: the supplicant looks back and be-
holds (amāru) their suffering, whereas they hope to see (amāru) Ishtar’s face. Note the
other instances of amāru in lines 41, 43, and 101.

ātamar bēltī šipṭa išīti u saḫmašti
Line 74: Mūtu, “death.” Šapšāqu, “constraint, hardship.” Kullu (D), “to hold, to hold
back.” The supplicant is already in the sphere of death. In line 73, they are the subject of a
verb for the last time in the complaint section. Here in line 74, they themselves are men-
tioned for the last time. In the following lines, the supplicant has grammatically vanished
and is present only in nouns that have a 1cs suffix.
ukallânni mūtu u šapšāqu
Line 75: Šuḫarruru, “to be deathly still.” Sagû (sāgu), “cella, shrine.” Aširtu (ešertu),
“chapel, shrine.” The verb appears as a predicative in both instances (3ms and 3fs).
šuḫarrur sagêya šuḫarrurat aširtī
Line 76: UGU : see line 8. KÁ = bābu, “gate, door.” Qarbatu (qerbetu), “environs, mead-
owland, field.” Šaqummatu, “deathly silence.” Tabāku, “to pour out.”

Line 78: Sapāḫu, “to scatter, to disperse.” Illatu, “family, group, clan.” Tabīnu, “shel-
ter.” Purruru (D of parāru), “to scatter, to smash.” The first complaint in this line is taken
up as a petition in line 89 (sapiḫtu illatī lipḫur).
sapḫat illatī tabīnī purrur
Line 79: GEŠTU = uznu, “ear, wisdom, understanding.” Both preterites can be under-
stood as performatives (see line 1). With this line, the attention turns back from the suffer-
ing of the supplicant to Ishtar. See the relation to line 14 (puqqu D). At the beginning of
the first invocation (line 1) and the first petition (line 42), the act of praying is mentioned.
In line 79, at the beginning of the second petition (lines 79–102), the main stress lies at
first on the awaiting of Ishtar’s reaction.
upaqqa ana bēltīya kâši ibšāki uznāya
Line 80: Kâši, “to you,” is redundant with the pronominal suffix (–ki) on the verb; it
probably serves to emphasize the supplicant’s calling out to the deity and it underlines the
shift of attention from the supplicant back to the deity. Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, liability, sin.”
Paṭāru , “to release, to absolve.” Now the act of praying is mentioned with direct reference
to the very beginning of the prayer (line 1: usallīki bēlet bēlēti ilat ilāti). Only here does it
become evident that the supplicant feels guilty despite the plea to the contrary in line 68.
In line 81, however, there is a whole catalogue of terms for sin and guilt, which has paral-
lels in other prayers (see Mayer, UFBG, 115, n.93.).
usallīki kâši eʾiltī puṭrī
Line 81: Arnu, “guilt, penalty, fault, sin.” Šērtu, “guilt, offense, punishment.” Gillatu,
“sin.” Ḫiṭītu, “act of negligence, sin, offense.”
puṭrī arnī šērtī gillatī u ḫiṭītī
Line 82: Mêšu, “to disregard.” Išītu, see line 73. See also line 43.
mēšī gillātīya [gloss: išītīya] leqê unnīnīya
Line 83: Ru-um-mi-ia is to be read as rummî (D impv. from ramû, “to release, to un-
lock”), a late Babylonian writing, see šadî in line 11 (Zgoll, 65). Kīsu, “bonds, binding.”
Šubarrû, “freedom from service obligations,” with a 1cs suffix.

Line 84: Kibsu, “step, track, route.” Namriš, “brilliantly, brightly.” Etelliš, “like a lord.”
Itti, “with.” The verb šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), here as an imperative, is used twice in the
first invocation to characterize Ishtar’s action towards mankind (see lines 2 and 26). The
petition in this line refers back to these praises and shows the interconnection between the
different parts of the prayer. LÚ . TI (or LÚ . TÌL ) = balṭu, an adj. meaning “alive, safe and
sound.” In its substantival use, it means “living person.” Compare mītu in line 40. SILA =
sūqu, “street.”
šutēširī kibsī namriš etelliš itti balṭūti lubāʾ sūqa
Line 85: Qibītu, “command, order.” Zenû, “angry.” Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace.”
Note the repetition of the root qabû, which is not translated concordantly. A variant in
another textual witness ( MS C: ilī ša iznû: “my god who was angry,” see Zgoll, 46) makes
clear that the personal god is meant.
qibî-ma ina qibītīki ilu zenû lislim
Line 86: In correspondence to the previous line, d 15 is best understood as a substan-
tive (ištaru, “goddess”) and not as Ishtar’s name. Unfortunately, MS C, the alternative tex-
tual witness in line 85, is broken here. Târu, “to return, to turn back, to relent.”
ištaru ša isbusa litūra
Line 87: Eṭû, “dark.” Qatru, “smoky.” Namāru (nawārum), “to become bright.” Kinūnu,
“brazier.” This and the following lines describe a state of darkness but petition for light
and warmth. See the praise of Ishtar’s astral aspects in the first invocation (see, e.g., lines
5, 35, and 37–38).
eṭû qatru limmir kinūnī
Line 88: Belû (m), belītu (f), “extinguished.” Nanpuḫu (N of napāḫu), “be ignited.”
Dipāru, see line 35.

Line 89: Sapḫu (m), sapiḫtu (f), “scattered.” Paḫāru, “gather, assemble” (intransitive).

Line 90: TÙR = tarbaṣu, “pen, enclosure, courtyard.” Rapāšu, “to be(come) broad,
wide.” Supūru, “sheepfold.” Šutaddulu (Dt of šadālu), “to be widened, broadened.” Lištamdil
is a 3cs precative, with reduplication via nasalisation (–dd– becomes –md–); see GAG §96j.
The final –u, as with other cases in this late Babylonian MS , is superfluous.
tarbaṣu lirpiš lištamdilu supūrī
Line 91: Magāru generally means “to consent, to agree,” but in this context of suppli-
cation it means “to hear, to grant.” The expression lebēn appa is not usually translated
literally (“stroking of the nose”), see CAD L, 11 (sub labānu), “to beg humbly, to exhibit
utmost humility (in gestures), to pray contritely.” It is usually found in the context of ges-
tures of praying, its function is to praise the gods and to accept their might; see Zgoll, 65;
Zernecke, 84 n.51. Supû, “prayer, supplication.”
mugrī lebēn appīya šimê supêya
Line 92: See lines 44 and 54. According to the first edition, “the second half of the
line has been deeply erased by the scribe” (King, pl. LXXXIII). Several translations com-
plete the line with “accept my supplication” (see, e.g., King, 1.235; Stephens, 385).
kīniš naplisīnnī-ma [...]
Line 93: See lines 56 and 59 for adi mati and line 85 for zenû, which is used predica-
tively here (2fs). In line 77, the same expression is used for the averted face of the person-
al deity (suḫḫurū pānū). Only here, at the end of the prayer, the supplicant can explicitly
mention Ishtar’s wrath. It is a distinctive feature of this prayer that her anger is not “cam-
ouflaged” in a subordinate clause (see Zgoll, 65, 93; Mayer, UFBG, 96, n.58).
adi mati bēltī zenâtī-ma suḫḫurū pānūki
Line 94: Raʾbu, “raging.” Uzzuzu (D of ezēzu), “to make furious,” but in the predica-
tive, “be infuriated.”
adi mati bēltī raʾbātī-ma uzzuzat kabtatki
Line 95: SIG 5 = damiqtu, “good, kind”; see line 53. Tirrī is a fs impv. from turru (D of
târu), “to turn, to bend.” Kišādu, “neck.” Ta-ad-di-ia is a late Babylonian writing for taddî
(see also lines 11 and 83; Zgoll, 65). The form is a G preterite from nadû, “to throw,” but
in reference to a body part it frequently means “to drop.” Amātu (awātum), “word, matter.”
Šakānu with pānū as the object, “to set the face,” means “to intend, to decide.”

Line 96: A . MEŠ = mû, “water.” ÍD = nāru, “river, watercourse, canal.” For the second
half of the line, see line 45. It is not clear to which act the reconciliation of the feelings is
compared in the first half of the line. Pa-šìr can be analysed as a G predicative or participle
of pašāru. Tertium comparationis is the water, but it is not clear if the water is calm, flow-
ing, or cleansing by flowing, or if this is a reference to the “undoing water” (mû pāširūtu)
from namburbi-rituals. The translation follows Zgoll’s, “wie (durch) Wasser, den ‘Löser’ des
Flusses,” who also offers a list of previous translations (53, 65–66). CAD P, 252–53 analyz-
es the word as pāširu, an adjective of uncertain meaning, and lists this passage together
with the namburbi references.

Line 97: Ekdu, see line 37. The adj. is used as a substantive here. Qaqqaru, “ground,

Line 98: This petition clearly refers back to the praise in line 31. Kunnušu, see line
31. Šupalsiḫī is a fs impv. from šupalsuḫu (Š of napalsuḫu), “to make prostrate.” Šaplu, liter-
ally means “bottom, underside,” but one might translate the present usage as “under me”
or even “at my feet.”

Line 106: This line is the subscription of the prayer, corresponding to the superscrip-

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
A text of such length and depth as Ishtar 2 comprises many aspects that
could be compared to biblical texts and their problems. Only two shall be men-
tioned here: an interesting structural parallel concerning the end of the prayer
and the two stages of use of this text. 1
The “Sudden Change of Mood”—A Structural Parallel. 2 A sudden transition
from complaints and petitions to praise and promise to praise at the end of the
text, the so-called sudden change of mood (“Stimmungsumschwung”), is a char-
acteristic feature of certain psalms of lament, though its interpretation is debat-
ed. One hypothesis reconstructs an oracle of salvation, which would have been
spoken by a priest, between the complaints and the praise. 3 The alternative in-
terpretation explains the change of mood within the course of the prayer: de-
spite describing a god-forsaken situation, the supplicant hopes that God is near
during their time of despair. On this line of interpretation complaints and peti-
tions are enriched by elements of trust; the elements of continuity between com-
plaint and praise are stressed. 4
As there is also a sudden change of mood in the prayers of the lifting of the
hand, it is strange that they have only rarely been used within this debate in Old
Testament scholarship. In this point, it is possible to compare the texts, and the
analogy is significant. The ritual instructions of the Mesopotamian prayers allow
one to draw conclusions about the ritual context of the recitation. Ishtar 2 hopes
for Ishtar’s verbal action, her “word of salvation,” in favor of the supplicant. But
there is no evidence that this word of salvation was “performed” in any way
within the ritual procedure.
1
Further comparative discussion concerning Ishtar 2 can be found in Zernecke, 276–362.
See ibid., 306–15.
3
The first prominent development of this hypothesis is Joachim Begrich, “Das priesterliche
Heilsorakel,” ZAW 52 (1934), 81–92.

Bernd Janowski, Konfliktgespräche mit Gott. Eine Anthropologie der Psalmen (2d. ed.; Neukirchen-
Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 2006), 77–84.
2280In both types of prayer the final praise has two different functions, one for
the relation between supplicant and deity and the other for the supplicant only.
The promise and the appeal to praise can be understood as “offer of service” by
the supplicant to the deity. They do not only promise to praise but to function
themselves as living examples of divine action. Such an unequivocal “offer of
service” can also be found in biblical texts. Note the appeal to Yahweh to save
the supplicant from the underworld, since no-one praises him there (see Ps 6:6,
30:10, 88:11–12, Isa 38:18). Such an offer can be understood within the concep-
tion of the prayer as audience, which is important at least for the prayers of the
lifting of the hand. 5 The gift as greeting in an actual audience (corresponding to
the offering in the hand-lifting ritual), the proskynesis, and the praise of the ele-
vated person aim at obligating the elevated person to help. The structure of the
audience—and the prayer respectively—want to make the counterpart accept
the petition. Because of the logic of reciprocity governing audiences in the an-
cient Near East, it is possible that the praying person already gives thanks and
praise though their situation is still the same.
The concluding praise has a second but different function for the suppli-
cant. 6 At the end of the prayer, they envision the power of the deity. They bring
to mind the deity they experience as turned away, hoping that the god will act
on their behalf. The certainty of salvation is realized in advance by articulating
it. In this context, the basic character of the prayers as set forms, not as individ-
ual expression has to be kept in mind: praise and promise to praise that antici-
pate the salvation can strengthen the trust of the supplicant in the saving power
of the deity. In this way, their function can be compared to the functions of the
expressions of confidence in the psalms of lament and the hymnic invocation in
the prayers of the lifting of the hand. The form invites the supplicant to leave
behind the fixation on their own needs and to rest in the saving action by the
deity. This structure can be compared to “de-reflection” in its psychotherapeutic
sense. Prayers of the lifting of the hand can lead back from the final praise into
the initial invocation in repeated recitations; psalms of lament can proceed from
complaint to praise. The sudden change of mood can be interpreted as an ele-
ment of “pastoral care” in both cases, independent of the different structures of
the prayers.
The form of the sudden change of mood in Ishtar 2 is special: there is not
only a promise to praise (lines 101–102) but the anticipated praise itself in the
final section of the prayer (lines 103–105). These last three lines could well be
set in quotation marks. This phenomenon is attested in other Mesopotamian
prayers, too, 7 but also in biblical laments of the individual. A striking example is

Ps 22, a long psalm of individual lament, in which the section of complaint,
mixed with petitions and expressions of confidence (Ps 22:2–22), is followed by
elements of a thanksgiving psalm: a double promise of praise (Ps 22:23, 26) and
its fulfillment (Ps 22:24–25, 27). 8 This “mixture of genres” has been interpreted
as indicating that the “true” genres and their Sitze im Leben were not valid any-
more at the time of writing; therefore, Ps 22 was considered “nachkultisch,” not
as prayer, but as “Gebetsliteratur” (prayer literature). 9 The parallel of Ishtar
2:101–105 makes it possible to understand Ps 22:23–27 as promise to praise and
anticipated praise without necessitating the use of source criticism. 10
The history of use. 11 The tablet BM 26187 ( MS A) only contains Ishtar 2. Its
colophon (lines 112–113 in Zgoll’s edition; line 111 gives the beginning of the
prayer Ishtar 3) can be translated as follows: “A copy from Borsippa. According
to its original. Nergal-balassu-iqbi, son of Atamar-KAL.ME, ritual expert (āšipu),
has written (it) for his life, checked (it) through and permanently deposited (it)
in Esagila.”
This colophon contains information about the scribe and the use he made of
this particular copy of the prayer. Nergal-balassu-iqbi, the scribe, was a ritual
expert (āšipu). 12 He deposited the tablet in Esagila, the temple of Marduk in Bab-
ylon, “for his life.” Thus, this tablet is a votive offering of one of the persons
who transmitted and executed this kind of ritual and was never meant to be
used for the execution of the ritual written down on it with all of the practical
instructions. The Sitz im Leben of the text inscribed on the tablet therefore is not
identical with its use. The use has changed; in this special case, it is part of the
“private piety” of a ritual expert.
In all probability, most psalms were not written for the collection of the
Book of Psalms, but independently, and were collected and arranged after-
wards—possibly also for “private piety” in the post-exilic period. 13 The two stag-
es of usage of Ishtar 2 are an interesting parallel to the development of the con-
textualization of the Psalms.

A Shuilla: Marduk 4
A LAN L ENZI
M ARDUK :
Marduk was the local god of the city of Babylon. He eventually replaced En-
lil as the chief god of the Mesopotamian pantheon. Although he had many
names, Bēl, “lord,” best conveys Marduk’s ultimate position in Mesopotamian
religious thought. Marduk’s shrine in Babylon was called É-sag-íl, “the house
with uplifted head,” and his ziggurat was É-temen-an-ki, “house of the founda-
tion platform of heaven and the netherworld.” Zarpanitu was Marduk’s consort;
Nabu was his son.
There is some dispute about the etymology and meaning of Marduk’s name.
The common logographic writing d AMAR . UTU may represent Sumerian amar-utu-
a(k). (Whether this is a genuine Sumerian etymology or a folk etymology, that
is, an indigenous attempt to explain an incomprehensible pre-Sumerian name
with Sumerian, is a matter of speculation and ultimately moot.) Some have
translated amar-utu-a(k) as “calf of the Sun (god)” (Lambert, 8) and others as
“calf of the storm” (Abusch, 543). In any case, the Sumerian etymology suggests
the early name of the deity (i.e., in the OB period) was Marūtuk or Marūtu,
which may have been shortened in later periods to Martuk / Marduk. But the
lack of unambiguous syllabic spellings of the name (e.g., d ma-ar- instead of the
typical d mar(u)-) 1 sheds some doubt on the existence of this short form as do
Hebrew and Greek transliterations of the name in the biblical tradition (e.g., Jer
50:2 MT : ‫ְך‬ ‫ֹד‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ‫;מ‬
Jer 27:2 LXX : μαρωδαχ). 2
Although Marduk is probably attested as early as the third millennium in
texts from Fara (ancient Shuruppak) and Abu Salabikh, 3 we can only begin to
trace his veneration in the OB period. Originally, Marduk was a rather insignifi-
cant local god from the city of Babylon, perhaps associated with justice (so

See Lambert, 7, who notes the increased use of CVCV signs in post-Kassite Akkadian and thus
the ambiguity of writings with mar.
2
Note also the spelling of the name in Ashurbanipal’s acrostic hymn to Marduk (ma-ru-du-uk).
See Alasdair Livingstone, Court Poetry and Literary Miscellanea (SAA 3; Helsinki: Helsinki Univer-
sity Press, 1989), no. 2, rev. 1, 3, 6, and 8.

The interpretation of these texts is disputed. Compare Sommerfeld, “Marduk,” 363 and Lam-
bert, 8.
291292Sommerfeld, 364), thunderstorms (so Abusch, 544), or canal digging (so Oshi-
ma). With the advent of Hammurabi in the early eighteenth century BCE and the
meteoric rise of Babylon as a political and cultural power, Marduk was elevated
to a position among the high gods of the pantheon. This is clearly evidenced by
the opening lines of the Code of Hammurabi as well as by Marduk’s growing
popularity as the theophoric element in personal names. 4 Although he was not
made the head of the pantheon in the OB period, Marduk’s prominence was se-
cured at this time and his cult spread to several other cities.
Marduk’s rise to the head of the pantheon is probably first officially recog-
nized during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I (1125–1104 BCE ), who unified post-
Kassite Babylonia and recovered Marduk’s statue from the Elamites, who had
carried it off a generation earlier. 5 Mythologically speaking, Marduk’s rise is
recounted in the Enūma eliš, which may date to this period (though the dating of
Enūma eliš continues to elicit debate). In this well-known myth the gods send
Marduk to defeat the raging Tiamat and her minions. As a reward for this heroic
exploit, the gods crown him king of the gods (see IV 28 and V 110). After Mar-
duk creates the cosmos and forms humanity, the gods build him a temple, Esagil,
and a ziggurat, Etemenanki, in Babylon. The myth concludes with a long section
in which the gods pronounce Marduk’s fifty names. The founding of Babylon in
this myth was clearly intended to replace the former central sanctuary of Meso-
potamia, Nippur, the seat of Enlil. Giving Marduk fifty names was a piece of
theological revisionism to position Marduk as the replacement of Enlil (whose
divine number was 50). 6
Throughout the first millennium, Marduk was honored as the chief god of
the Mesopotamian pantheon, even recognized as such by the Assyrians in their
royal inscriptions. This prominence was celebrated in an unparalleled manner
during the Neo-Babylonian empire and later employed politically by the Persians
to legitimize their conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE (see The Cyrus Cylinder 7 ).
Although the cult of Marduk suffered a major set back when Alexander failed to
rebuild Marduk’s destroyed temple complex, Marduk (Bel) was still revered in
the Hellenistic and Parthian periods.
4
Sommerfeld has shown that the use of Marduk as a theophoric element in personal names sky-
rocketed between the early and late OB periods, so much so that he thinks it likely that nearly
every family had a member bearing a name formed on Marduk (“Marduk,” 364).

Mesopotamian Religion,” in The Seed of Wisdom: Essays in Honour of T. J. Meeks (ed. Stewart

A similar attempt is probably attested in the god list AN = d Anum, where Marduk is given fifty
names (some of which are different from those in Enūma eliš). See Richard L. Litke, A Reconstruc-
tion of the Assyro-Babylonian God-Lists, AN : d an-nu-um and AN : anu ša amēli (Texts from the
Babylonian Collection 3; New Haven: Yale Babylonian Collection, 1998), 89–95, esp. 89, note to

Marduk was associated and then identified with a god named Asalluḫi (As-
arluḫi), a move that started in the early OB period and was completed by Kassite
times. 8 Since Asalluḫi was the son of Ea, god of wisdom and magic, this identifi-
cation resulted in linking Marduk (and therefore Babylon) to the ancient and
prestigious pantheon of Eridu, which gave Marduk, who was previously an in-
significant deity, a legitimate place in the high levels of the Mesopotamian pan-
theon and bolstered his authority. 9 It is no accident therefore to see Marduk’s
birth to Ea (and Damkina) depicted in Enūma eliš I 79–108. 10 We know that
Marduk became an important god of magic and exorcism. What is not complete-
ly clear is whether this status suggested his eventual identification with Asalluḫi
or whether it was the result of his association with Asalluḫi and/or Ea. For more
about Asalluḫi, see page 403.
In iconography Marduk was symbolized by a pointed spade and associated
with a snake-dragon (mušḫuššu). Jupiter was his astrological representation.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer shows the three typical structural elements of a shuilla-prayer,
hymnic introduction, petition, and concluding praise, but it implements these in
an unusual manner, probably under the influence of ershaḫunga-prayers.
The prayer opens with an unusually short invocation and hymnic introduc-
tion; in fact, its two lines form one of the shortest hymns attested among shuilla-
prayers.
The petition section of the prayer is also unusual in size, accounting for all
but a couple of the text’s remaining lines (3–27, 29–39). This section divides
into several smaller units that may be characterized successively as complaint,
protest, and petition. An introductory complaint in lines 3–6 is followed by the
supplicant’s protestation of human fallibility and ignorance in lines 8–15—an
unusual theme for a shuilla but attested in ershaḫungas (see page 449). 11 A sec-
ond invocation in line 7 bridges the two units. A unique and very brief self-
presentation formula (line 16a) stands at the head of the first section of petitions
(lines 16b–27). A second section of petitions, whose leitmotif is anticipated by
line 19b, occurs in lines 29–39. This section consists of a seven-fold, repetitive
litany in which the supplicant pleads for forgiveness of sin (lines 29–37) and a
couplet in which the supplicant seeks the restoration of parent-like divine favor

See Mayer’s edition, 199, who notes parallels with ershaḫungas and several other kinds of
prayers, including a “literary prayer” to Marduk, for which, see W. G. Lambert, “Three Literary
Prayers of the Babylonians,” AfO 19 (1959/1960), 47–66, here 57:105–110. Translations of the
latter are in Foster, 611–16, Seux, 172–81, von Soden, 270–72, and Hecker, TUAT II/5, 754–58.
9294(lines 38–39). Both of these elements reflect the concluding sections of the er-
shaḫunga-prayers (compare the ending of the prayer at page 448, n.5 and see
the general introduction, page 46); they do not normally occur in Akkadian
shuillas. 12
Lines 28 and 40 bracket this second section of petitions and together form a
disjointed promise of praise that concludes the prayer. This discontinuous con-
cluding praise might suggest that lines 29–39 are a secondary insertion in the
prayer. 13 Given the manner in which incantation-prayers were adjusted and
adapted for various purposes, this is not an implausible suggestion, but it is not
currently supported by the evidence at hand (i.e., we do not have a MS lacking
the litany). Rather than evidence for literary accretion, it seems more likely that
the disjointed promise of praise points to the influence of another structural fea-
ture of the ershaḫungas. As mentioned in the general introduction, the er-
shaḫunga-prayers may include a transitional statement that leads into the inter-
cessory litany; this transition may include praise to the deity. Given this and the
affinities mentioned above, it is likely that the text of this prayer was influenced
by typical features of both the shuilla- and ershaḫungas-prayers.
Three elements frame the prayer: the invocation qarrādu Marduk, “O warri-
or Marduk,” in line 1 and line 40; the parental imagery in line 2 (abu) and lines
38–39 (abi ālidīya, ummi ālittīya); and the contrasting imagery of the supplicant
as an old man (šību) in line 6 and as a youth (ṣeḫērīya) in line 36. Two of these
framing elements also appear in the middle of the text: the parental / familial
terms appear in lines 22–23 and the supplicant’s youth mentioned in line 18.
Furthermore, the qarrādu Marduk invocation occurs again at line 30. All of these
features lend literary coherence to the prayer.
The three-fold repetition of the invocation qarrādu Marduk, “O warrior
Marduk,” in lines 1, 30, and 40 may help bind this rather complex and atypical
prayer into a unit. But Hunt (90–91) argues that this epithet may also shed light
on the prayer’s literary development. Because he believes qarrādu is superfluous
in the opening hymn (i.e., it has no parallel in line 2) and absent in a (supposed)
citation of the prayer’s incipit in a letter from an exorcist (ABL 716 = SAA 18,
no. 181, rev. 25), he suggests the epithet may have been inserted into line 1 to
give unity to the prayer after the petitionary litany in lines 29–39 had been, in
his opinion, added. Although this is an interesting idea, the evidence is not
strong enough to support it. First, Hunt’s poetic understanding of lines 1–2 is
open to question. Qarrādu may not have a parallel term in line 2 but neither
does Marduk’s name; the parallelism between lines 1–2 lies in ša ezissu abūbu 
napšuršu abu rēmēnû. Since qarrādu Marduk was a commonly used phrase to de-
scribe Marduk (see CAD Q, 141), it may have been understood as a single epi-
thet here, whose lack of parallel in line 2 was intended to give the deity’s invo-
cation prominence in this first line of the prayer. Second, the assumed absence

295
of the word qarrādu in the citation of the prayer’s incipit may be a mistaken
assumption. Perhaps the writer of the letter who cited the incipit simply left
qarrādu out due to a memory lapse or because the word did not fit his rhetorical
purpose. If one looks at the context of the letter, the writer is alluding to attrib-
utes of Marduk to flatter the king; he is not explicitly citing an incipit to pre-
scribe a prayer. In fact, it may well be that he was not alluding to this prayer at
all. Rather, he may have been simply using epithets of Marduk that also occur in
our prayer to flatter the king. It is clear that our prayer has been influenced by
features of ershaḫunga-prayers. But the evidence is still too slight and ambigu-
ous to posit this influence occurred after the initial composition of the prayer
rather than at the time of it.
The prayer turns thematically on a single idea, forgiveness of sins, and
therefore recalls the themes of the ershaḫunga- and dingirshadibba-prayers, both
of which are penitential in nature. 14 Although the supplicant confesses sin in
lines 16–18 and 36, they also present three general reasons for sin—not to ex-
cuse their disobedience but to garner mercy and avert punishment. First, lines 8–
15, the protest section, depict humans as frail and ignorant, living and working
under a divine economy that makes human sin practically inevitable. The prayer
seems to ask implicitly, How could the supplicant not sin in such a world? Sec-
ond, the prayer mentions the issue of adolescent sins twice (lines 18 and 36). In
these cases, the supplicant seems to request forbearance for immature mistakes.
Finally, inherited sin or collective guilt finds a place in the prayer in lines 22–24.
The supplicant does not plead their family’s innocence in these lines. Rather,
they wish to avert personal responsibility for the sins and ask that the sins’ ill
effect go elsewhere. Throughout the long petitionary section of the prayer, one
sees a supplicant striving to cover the gamut of reasons for culpability, includ-
ing, significantly, the mention of inadvertent sin in line 18b. Such broad cover-
age of possibilities is clearly due to the supplicant’s ignorance of a precise cause
for the misfortune that has come their way, a common motif in Mesopotamian
religious texts. 15
But all is not darkness and gloom. There is reason for hope, which peeks
through in line 40, in the very existence of the prayer itself: for if there was no
hope for the supplicant to change the situation, there would be no reason to use
the divinely-inspired shuilla.
Two MSS preserve varying ritual instructions. Mayer’s MS A is followed here.
MS A also preserves a catchline to Marduk 9 (see Mayer, UFBG, 396) after our
line 45 and before the tablet’s colophon.

e-ziz-su a-bu-bu
Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer but is not a part of the prayer itself. It may have been read as Sumerian rather
than Akkadian. The prayer opens with a very short hymnic introduction that invokes Mar-
duk with appropriate divine epithets. Qarrādu, “hero, warrior.” Qarrādu is a very common
epithet for male deities (see CAD Q, 141–42). d AMAR . UTU = Marduk. Ezēzu, “to be(come)
angry, furious.” Ezissu is a 3ms predicative plus 3ms (resumptive) pronominal suffix, which
literally means “his being angry,” that is, Marduk’s present state of rage. It is best rendered
by “his anger.” The pronominal suffix resumes the relative pronoun ša at the head of the
phrase (ša ezissu abūbu). Abūbu, “flood,” is often used metaphorically to characterize the
inexorable power of a deity’s anger, a king’s military actions, or either’s weapons (see CAD
A/1, 78–79).
šiptu: qarrādu Marduk ša ezissu abūbu
Line 2: Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled to, to forgive.” Abu,
“father.” Rēmēnû, “merciful.” (Gula is called “merciful [rēmēnû] mother” on page 246.)
Abu, a positive image here, plays on the negative abūbu in line 1. The use of eziz and
napšur here at the beginning of the prayer recalls the second line in the opening hymn of
Ludlul bēl nēmeqi (see page 486): eziz mūši muppašir urri, “he is angry at night but relenting
at daybreak” (I 2). As mentioned by Hunt (89), it is significant that the merciful aspect of
Marduk’s character lies closest to the petitionary part of the prayer that follows.
napšuršu abu rēmēnû
Line 3: This line begins the complaint section of the prayer. Qabû, “to speak, to com-
mand, to decree.” Lā, “not,” is the particle used to negate individual substantives. Šemû,𒌋𒐋 A S HUILLA : M ARDUK 4

re-mé-nu-ú
“to hear.” The infinitives are being used as nouns here (more specifically, as gerunds),
“speaking and not hearing.” Ineffective speech, to speak an unheeded word, is a common
Mesopotamian concern. When in the context of other humans, this anxiety may be related
to a (perceived) loss of communal respect or self-esteem. In a context of divine communi-
cation, the supplicant expresses worries that his petitions are ignored. The heavens have
become brass. Dalāpu, “to keep someone awake, to stir up, to harrass.” The –dd– in the
verb is the result of an assimilation of the perfect’s infixed –t– to the first letter of the root.
See also the verb in line 4. (One exemplar of the prayer inserts a still very fragmentary line
between lines 3 and 4. All that is preserved is the word iššaknūni, “they are placed here for
me.” See Mayer, 201.)
qabû u lā šemû iddalpanni
Line 4: Šasû, “to shout, to call out.” Apālu, “to answer.” Dâṣu, “to treat with injustice,
to treat with disrespect.” With perfect grammatical parallelism, line 4 restates line 3; se-
mantically speaking, however, the two lines bear witness to an intensifying of the anxiety.
The action in the lines moves from reception of the spoken word (“hearing”) to active
response (“answering”), precisely what the supplicant wants but is not getting. Moreover,
the supplicant’s reaction moves from agitation to a feeling of disrespect.
šasû u lā apālu iddāṣanni
Line 5: Ammatu, literally, “forearm, cubit,” but seems to have a metaphorical mean-
ing here (and only here), “strength” (see CAD A/2, 70, which says the meaning of this
passage is uncertain). Libbu, “heart, mind.” Šūṣû (Š of [w]aṣû), “to cause to go out, to ex-
pel.” Given the odd use of ammatu and its phonological similarities to amātu (awātum),
“word, matter,” one might well wonder if there is a double meaning to this line. The pri-
mary one is clear: the supplicant’s strength is sapped; the secondary one, reading the verb
as a 1cs, is more subtle: the supplicant has revealed the secrets of his heart, presumably to
the god. For amāta šūṣû, “to reveal a matter (i.e., secret),” see CAD A/2, 372–73. On this
reading, line 5 is a sort of conceptual pivot point between lines 3–4 and line 6.
ammatīya ina libbīya uštēṣī-ma
Line 6: Kīma, “like.” Šību, “elder, old person.” Quddudu (D of qadādu), “to bend down,
to bow low.” Although qadādu sometimes describes a gesture of humility, the preceding
line and the simile here (kīma šībi) require us to understand the verb in terms of degenera-
tion of the supplicant’s body. The chain of 3cs perfect verb forms continues into this line,
the last of the complaint section. It is surely significant that three of the four verbs in the
complaint section end with the –anni pronominal suffix.
kīma šībi uqtaddidanni
Line 7: EN = bēlu, “lord.” GAL = rabû (m), “great.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.” Line 7 pro-
vides a transition between the complaint and protest sections of the prayer. This line’s2988. a-me-lu-tu ma-la šu-ma na-bat

vocative, “O great lord Marduk,” is unique within the prayer (compare lines 1, 30, and

ly become Marduk’s primary name in Babylon.
bēlu rabû Marduk ilu rēmēnû
Line 8: Lines 8–15 form the supplicant’s protest, not of innocence but of human frail-
ty and the divine economy that makes human sin practically inevitable. Compare the simi-
lar ideas about human sinfulness in lines 132–134 of a dingirshadibba (see W. G. Lambert,
“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” JNES 33 (1974), 280–83) and other examples cited by
Hunt, 101–4 and Karel van der Toorn, “Theodicy in Akkadian Literature,” in Theodicy in
the World of the Bible: The Goodness of God and the Problem of Evil (ed. Antti Laato and Jo-
hannes C. de Moor; Leiden: Brill, 2003), 62, 72–73. Human ignorance and tendency to sin
is not used as an excuse; rather, they are a basis for the supplicant’s request for divine
mercy and forgiveness. Amēlūtu (amīlūtu, awīlūtum), “humanity, human being, people.”
Mala, “as much as, as many as.” Šumu, “name.” Nabû, “to name.” Mala / ša šuma nabû, is
an idiom for “everything, everyone” (see CAD N/1, 35 for other examples with amēlūtu).
Foster’s “by whatever name” captures the sense and style of the Akkadian idiom nicely
(680). Nabât is fem. because amēlūtu is fem. Line 8 introduces by way of anacoluthon the
referent of mannu, “who?,” in the next several lines.
amēlūtu mala šuma nabât
Line 9: Annu (arnu), “guilt, fault, sin.” Ramānīša, “itself, its own”; the fem. pronomi-
nal suffix refers back to amēlūtu. Mannu, “who?” Lamādu, “to learn, to recognize, to under-
stand.” Lines 9–11 use rhetorical questions (note the use of mannu in each) to emphasize
humanity’s ignorance with regard to their own sins. Prayers often express this idea with
simple statements such as “I do not know my sin” or “my sin which I do not know but you
know” (compare line 18 below). The point is clear: Mesopotamians almost always assumed
some sin was behind the problems they experienced, even when they could not identify it
(see similarly Mayer, 207).
anna ramānīša mannu ilammad
Line 10: Lā, “not,” is also the form of negation used after interrogative pronouns.
Šêṭu, “to miss, to disdain, to be negligent.” Ayû (ajû, ayyu), “who?, which?, what?” Gullulu,
“to commit a sin.” Continuing the rhetorical questions, the line offers two that are both
grammatically and semantically parallel. These raise the stakes laid out in lines 8–9 be-
cause not only is it difficult to know one’s own sins, everyone does it. Everyone sins. For
similar statements in prayers, see the references in Seux, 170, n.10.

human realm (line 9) to the divine (line 11). Alaktu, usually means “way, manner, course,”
but also means “divine decree” in some contexts (see I. Tzvi Abusch, “Alaktu and Hala-
khah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 [1987], 15–52). If the latter meaning
is correct here, the supplicant may be complaining that the divine will is inscrutable. See
similarly, e.g., the statement in Ludlul II 34–36 (see Amar Annus and Alan Lenzi, Ludlul bēl
nēmeqi: The Standard Babylonian Poem of the Righteous Sufferer (SAACT 7; Helsinki: The
Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2010) , xxi, with other references cited in n.35).
alakti ili mannu ilammad
Line 12: Itʾudu (Gt of naʾādu), “to watch carefully, to observe strictly.” Gullutu, “sin,”
which is cognate to the verb in line 10. Rašû, “to acquire, to gain.” The 1cs precative may
express an indirect command (“I ought”) here (and in line 13) rather than a wish (“let
me”). One’s understanding of the context will determine one’s decision between the two.
In the second half of the line, the lā plus durative indicates a prohibitive (“I may not”).
After painting the big picture of human ignorance, the prayer now focuses in on the indi-
vidual supplicant. The second half of the line presents the result of the supplicant’s actions
in the first half.
luttaʾid-ma gullultu lā arašši
Line 13: Ašru, “place, location”; ašrātu (pl). Balāṭu, “life, health, well-being.” Šiteʾʾû
(Gtn of šeʾû) means “to look all over, to search everywhere” but also “to be assiduous (in
reverence) toward,” especially when used with something like ašrāt ili, “sanctuaries of a
god” (see CAD Š/2, 358–62).
ašrāt balāṭi lušteʾʾī-ma
Line 14: Arratu, “curse.” Ittabbulu (Gtn of [w]abālu), “to look after, to manage, to
direct, to be active.” The form is an inf. DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Qabât is a 3fs predicative
from qabû, which here seems to mean something like “to command, to decree.” The fem.
subject may go back to amēlūtu in line 8 or may simply refer to the general situation de-
scribed in the line (an impersonal “it”); in either case, the focus is pulled away from the
supplicant and back onto a general, rather pessimistic view of humanity’s situation (lines
8–11), as is clear from line 15, which shows why the sentiments of lines 12–13 are so diffi-
cult to implement in real life (see Mayer, 207).

Line 15: Qātu, “hand.” LÚ = amēlu (amīlu, awīlum), “human being, man.” Qāt DN,
“the hand of [a god’s name],” is often used to denote illnesses and diseases (e.g., qāt Ištar).
Here the word may explain arratu in the previous line, meaning something like divine
weight or affliction (see Foster, 681 for the latter option). Babālu, “to carry, to bring,” is a
by-form of (w)abālu, the inf. of which was also used in the previous line (in the Gtn stem).
qāta ša ili ana amēli babālu
Line 16: The self-presentation formula is minimal. ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.”
Servant language is very common in Mesopotamian religious texts. The gods are conceived
as divine kings. Humans are therefore their subjects. Anāku, “I.” This is the only instance
of aradka preceding anāku in a self-presentation formula (see Mayer, UFBG, 49, n.8). Some
MSS preserve the opposite, more typical order (see UFBG, 203, n.16(1)). There are at least
three possible understandings of aradka anāku. The phrase may be understood as a nomi-
nal sentence, “I am your servant.” The two words may be in apposition to one another and
rendered as an introduction to the line, “as for your servant, me.” (More idiomatic English
requires rephrasing: “as for me, your servant.”) Finally, aradka may introduce the line, “as
for your servant,” and anāku may emphasize the first person verb, “I myself, I actually.”
One’s interpretive decision here and in the rest of the line will be based on one’s under-
standing of the larger context. Šettūtu, “sin.” Lū plus preterite may express concession,
“even if, even though,” or affirmation, “indeed, verily” (see also line 17). Epēšu, “to do.”
The prayer returns to focus on the supplicant, who confesses that they have in fact sinned.
aradka anāku šettūtu lū ēpuš
Line 17: Itû, “boundary, border.” Etēqu, “to cross over, to pass through.” Idiomatical-
ly, itâ etēqu means “to trespass, to transgress.” Line 17 provides a second, parallel confes-
sion of sin to that of line 16.
itâ ša ili lū ētiq
Line 18: The restoration here follows Mayer, who also lists and discusses the variants
in the other textual witnesses (203, n.18(1) and 209–10). The line opens with a subordi-
nate clause in which the ša functions substantively, “that which.” We expect the verb to
conclude the clause, but in this poetic context the word order does not follow the norm.
Meṣḫēriš, “in / during childhood, youth.” The supplicant refers back to possible sins com-
mitted earlier in his life. ZU = edû (idû), “to know.” NU = lā, “not.” Here the supplicant
covers both known sins and those unknown to them—a common motif in Mesopotamian
religious texts. The entire subordinate clause forms the object of the main verb, an impera-
tive. Mêšu, “to disregard, to forgive.” We expect the imperative of mêšu (mēš) to appear
without a final vowel. For other instances of the imperative with various final vowels, see
CAD M/2, 42. This line forms the beginning of a long litany of petitions.

Line 19: Libbu, see line 5. Nakādu, literally, “to throb, to pound.” Ina libbīka nakādu
may be understood metaphorically to mean “to worry, to be concerned about.” Paṭāru, “to
loosen, to undo, to release.” Šērtu, “guilt, offence, punishment.” Pašāru, “to loosen, to un-
do, to release.” Both pašāru and paṭāru occur in contexts dealing with the forgiveness of
sins/guilt or the release from sickness/demonic oppression (CAD P, 237–39 and 290–92).
The second half of line 19 anticipates lines 29–35. Volitional forms, here a vetitive (a neg-
ative precative) and two imperatives, continue to dominate the text and will continue to
do so for a number of lines hence. Notice, finally, the consonance and assonance in the
second half of the line.

Line 20: Lines 20 and 21 seem rather short and probably belong together in one poet-
ic line. Ešû, “unclear, confused, uncertain.” Ešâtīya is a mp verbal adjective with a 1cs
pronominal suffix, “my confused states (of mind)” (similarly dalḫâtīya in line 21). Num-
muru (D of namāru), “to brighten, to illuminate, to clarify, to clear up.” The imperative
requests a reversal of the supplicant’s state of mind (likewise in line 21).
ešâtīya nummer
Line 21: Dalḫu, “troubled, disturbed” (when used of water the word means, “mud-
died,” and of eyes, “blurred”). Zukkû (D of zakû), “to cleanse, to purify, to free.” Lines 20
and 21 show close grammatical and semantic parallelism. Significantly, ešâtu and dalḫâtu
are also both used to describe ambiguous results of divination (“omens are confused”); see,
e.g., CAD E, 378.
dalḫâtīya zukki
Line 22: AD = abu, “father.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix, “my.” AMA = ummu,
“mother.” It is not uncommon for a prayer to add a reference to one’s brother and sister in
such a list of relatives (see line 2 on page 136 for an example in this volume). In fact, three
MSS of the present prayer preserve a longer list that includes them (see Mayer, 203,
n.22(5)). This line and the next form the compound subject of the vetitive in line 24, ayy-
iṭḫâ. The supplicant turns now to deal with sin that may have been inherited from family
members.
anna abīya abi abīya anna ummīya ummi ummīya
Line 23: Kimtu, “family.” Nišūtu, “kin, relatives.” Salātu, “family, clan.” The list of
relatives continues from line 22 but now with collective terms rather than terms for indi-30224. a-na ra-ma-ni-ia a-a TE -a a-ḫi-tam-ma lil-lik

vidual members. Notice how the 1cs pronominal suffixes on each noun in lines 22 and 23
affect the phonological rhythm of the lines.
anna kimtīya nišūtīya u salātīya
Line 24: Ana ramānīya, literally, “to my person, self.” TE = ṭeḫû, “to draw near, to
approach.” The phonetic complement on the logogram (–a) must indicate the ventive.
Aḫītam, “aside, elsewhere,” is an adverb of place. Alāku, “to go.” The two halves of the line
are generally parallel in terms of grammar and semantics. Rather than the supplicant wish-
ing guilt (or its consequences) to be turned toward some other person (e.g., a foreigner or
enemy, aḫû), the supplicant simply wishes it to go away, to go elsewhere (aḫītam alāku).
ana ramānīya ayy-iṭḫâ aḫītam-ma lillik
Line 25: Mayer has collated the witnesses to this line and determined that the reading
previous translators have used (iq-ṭa-ba-an-ni, deriving from King’s copy, BMS 11) is mis-
taken. He takes the first verb as a Š durative of ṭâbu, “to make good, to make favorable,”
with the š changing to l before the dental, rather than taking it as a G perfect of qabû (see
Mayer, 210–11). Due to the non-volitional form of the verb at its head (a durative), previ-
ous translators have usually understood the first half of the line as a subordinate clause,
either conditional (assuming an understood šumma, “if”) or temporal (enūma, “when”). GIM
= kīma, “like.” Ú . KI . KAL = sassatu, “grass.” The supplicant wants to become as pure as
grass. Ubbubu (D of ebēbu), “to cleanse, to purify.” The form is a D impv. with a 1cs object
suffix. Since the other volitional forms in the immediate context are directed to Marduk, it
seems likely that the final verb in this line is, too. One might identify the god mentioned in
the first half of the line as either Marduk or the supplicant’s personal god. The latter may
seem more likely given the generic and personal manner of reference: ilī, “my god” (thus
Mayer, 206). But one does not expect Marduk to wait on a personal god’s actions to act
upon the supplicant’s petition (ubbibanni, “purify me”). Moreover, the supplicant asks
Marduk to entrust them to the hands of the personal deities in the very next line. The sup-
plicant therefore does not seem to be in any position just yet to place hope in the actions
of the personal god. Finally, one might wonder if the orthography for ilī, ì-lí = NI-NI, pre-
served in one MS (another reads DINGIR . MU ), was intentionally used to differentiate between
Marduk and the personal god, who is referred to in the next line with the more typical
logogram DINGIR . (For different understandings of the line, see, e.g., Hunt, 122–24 and
Seux, 171, n.27.)

= ištarī, “my goddess.” Šalmu, “peace, well-being.” TI . LA = balāṭu, “life, health, well-
being.” Paqādu + ana, “to entrust, to hand over something to someone.” The supplicant
continues to petition the deity for favor. In this case, he requests the deity to entrust them
into the hands of their personal god and goddess. It is significant that the text specifies
“the favorable hands” of the deities. The working assumption in the prayer may be that𒌋𒐋 A S HUILLA : M ARDUK 4

the supplicant was not on the best of terms with the personal deities. They now ask Mar-
duk to set that relationship aright. The imagery of the “hand of a god” here and in line 15
presents a significant contrast.
ana qātī damqāti ša ilīya u ištarīya ana šalme u balāṭi piqdanni
Line 27: Ikribū, “prayers, votive offerings” (for a discussion of the nuances of this
term, see CAD I/J, 66). Teslītū, “petitions, requests.” Tēmēqū (tēmīqū), “deep prayers, well-
conceived presentations of a case” (see CAD T, 335). Dāriš, “forever.” Izuzzu, “to stand, to
serve,” has here a dative 2ms pronominal suffix, “to, for you.” Having addressed their
position with regard to their personal deities, the supplicant now attends to their relation-
ship to Marduk. They wish to stand before him in perpetual supplication. Standing before
another is a sign of one’s subservience. This fits the relationship between deity and suppli-
cant perfectly (see line 16, aradka). Perpetual supplication may seem obsequious, but one
might also consider this wish from another standpoint: uninterrupted access. To have con-
stant communicative access with the deity would be a great privilege and a means for
insuring one’s security. Contrast this desire with the problem mentioned in line 3.
ikribē teslītī u tēmēqī dāriš luzzizku
Line 28: Nišū (f), “people, populace.” Dešû, “abundant, numerous.” The precise syn-
tactical function of KUR = mātu, “country, land,” and the relative clause that it governs is
unclear. It may be in apposition to nišū dešâtu, “abundant people,” at the head of the line.
It may modify nišū dešâtu somehow: “the abundant people (living in, of, from) the land. . .”
(see CAD D, 129 and Š/1, 148). Or, it may functional adverbially, specifying where the
people offer their praise: “let the abundant people praise you (in) the land. . . .” Ašru, see
line 13. Šakānu, “to put, to establish, to set up.” The nuanced meaning of the relative
phrase ša ina ašri šaknat, literally, “which is set in (its) place,” is also unclear (see Mayer,
211). The CAD suggests “which is well organized” (D, 129 and N/1, 102) or “which is well
established” (Š/1, 148). AHw suggests “which lies on the earth” (83, see likewise, Hunt,
127–28), but understanding ašru as “earth” is unique. Nâdu, “to praise.” The final verb is
actually the first word in line 29, but it only makes sense if it is considered a part of line
28. The supplicant now broadens their view and wishes that a large body of people will
also honor Marduk with their praise. The implication is that the people will see what Mar-
duk has done for the supplicant and join in their thanksgiving. The same idea is presented
explicitly and more fully in Ludlul IV 69–82 (according to the line numbers of SAACT 7).
This line seems to lead naturally into line 40, the final line of the prayer.
nišū dešâtu māti ša ina ašri šaknat linādūka
Line 29: This line begins a seven-fold petition for forgiveness of sin. The supplicant
begins here with a general request, presumably directed to Marduk. All of the ones to
follow will be directed to a specifically invoked deity. It may be surprising to see the issue30430. UR . SAG d AMAR . UTU an-ni

of forgiveness resurface after the wish for widespread praise of the deity in line 28. But the
prayer seems to be under the influence of the ershaḫunga’s form (see the introduction to
this prayer). For annu, paṭāru, and pašāru, see lines 9 and 19. Annu is consistently written
with the 1cs pronominal suffix in the following lines.
annī puṭur annī pušur
Line 30: UR . SAG = qarrādu. See line 1 for this epithet. Although the prayer is already
directed to Marduk, the supplicant re-invokes Marduk, echoing the opening words of the
prayer, and asks him to forgive their sins. This line seems redundant after line 29.
qarrādu Marduk annī puṭur annī pušur
Line 31: GAŠAN = bēltu, “lady.” GAL = rabītu (f), “great.” d E 4 -ru 6 -u 8 is Zarpānītu, con-
sort of Marduk (see Mayer’s MS E, which spells out the goddess’s name).
bēltu rabītu Zarpānītu annī puṭur
Line 32: Šumu, “name.” Ṭābu, “sweet, good,” used with šumu means “excellent, wor-
thy.” d AG = Nabû, scribal god and son of Marduk (see page 325).
šumu ṭābu Nabû annī puṭur
Line 33: Tašmētum, consort of Nabu. The litany appeals to the first god of the panthe-
on and his spouse in lines 30–31 and then the next ranking divine pair, Nabu and Tash-
metu, in lines 32–33.
bēltu rabītu Tašmētum annī puṭur
Line 34: d U . GUR = Nergal (one MS writes Nergal’s name d GÌR . UNU . GAL ), an underworld
deity associated with plague and disaster (see page 339). He is probably used here as a
contrast to the heavenly gods invoked in the next line (Hunt, 133).
qarrādu Nergal annī puṭur
Line 35: Ašābu (wašābum), “to sit, to dwell.” d Anum is literally “(the god) Anu,” who
stands for the cosmic realm of “heaven” here. The litany broadens its view to all the celes-
tial deities.

Line 36: Ša introduces a relative clause that modifies anna rabâ. Ultu, often for ištu,
“from, out of; since, after, when.” Ūmu, “day.” Ṣeḫēru, “to be(come) small, little,” but as an
infinitive, “to be young, to be a minor” (see CAD Ṣ, 122). The pronominal suffix is the
subject of the infinitive, literally, “my being a minor.” A substantive would provide a bet-
ter idiomatic rendering. Epēšu, “to do, to make.” Here īpušu stands for ēpušu (1cs). The
final –u is the subjunctive marker, indicating that the verb only functions within the rela-
tive clause; it is not the main verb of the sentence. The entire line forms the object of the
verbs in line 37. The supplicant now treats the accumulation of all of their sins since their
youth as one large, collective sin. In so doing, it recalls line 18.
anna rabâ ša ultu ūm ṣeḫērīya īpušu
Line 37: Suppuḫu (D of sapāḫu), “scatter, disperse.” EN = adi, “up to, until, as far as.”
7 -šu = sebîšu, “seven times, sevenfold.” A seven-fold dispersal, paralleling the seven-fold
call for forgiveness in lines 29–35, indicates the desire for total forgiveness of all accumu-
lated sin. The supplicant wants a fresh start, a clean slate.
suppiḫ-ma adi sebîšu puṭur
Line 38: Alādu (walādum), “to give birth to” (female subject), “to engender, to beget”
(male subject). The pronominal suffix on the participle (here and in the next line, accord-
ing to Mayer’s MS A) is the object of the verbal action. Libbaka is the object of the sen-
tence’s main verb at the end of line 39. The parental simile here and in the next line re-
calls the use of abu in line 2.
libbaka kīma abi ālidīya
Line 39: Ālittu is a fs participle from alādu. The third root letter d, a dental, has assim-
ilated to the t of the feminine marker. Ašrīšu is ašru plus a 3ms pronominal suffix. Târu, “to
return, to turn back”; but târu with ašru means “to return to normal” (see CAD T, 255).
Marduk has been angry; his heart has been exercised. The supplicant asks that Marduk
now return to normal (i.e., relent from his anger), which the supplicant defines in terms of
the affection of human parents.
u kīma ummi ālittīya ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 40: The same invocation used in lines 1 and 30 is repeated here in the otherwise
formulaic promise of praise. Bulluṭu, “to restore to health, to revive.” Dalīlū, “praises.”
Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and
its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomatically, “let me proclaim your
praises” or the like.

Line 41: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the kind of prayer on the tablet and to
whom it is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated,
“it is the wording of a lifted-hand to Marduk.”
Line 42: KÌD . KÌD . BI = kik(k)iṭṭûšu, “its ritual.” One MS preserves a common alternative:
= epuštašu, “its ritual.” The ritual follows Mayer’s MS A. A variation of this ritual
exists in his MS d. KÌD . KÌD . BI (or DÙ . DÙ . BI ) alerts the user of the tablet that the ritual instruc-
tions follow. Compare the ÉN at the beginning of the prayer. All of the items included in
the following are common elements of Mesopotamian ritual. IGI = pānu, “face,” or maḫru,
“front”; both are possible. Ana pāni, maḫri means “to the face of, in front of.” NÍG . NA =
nignakku, “incense burner.” ( GIŠ .) ŠIM . LI = burāšu, “juniper” (pieces of wood or its resin).
The juniper is the material to be burnt in the incense burner. GAR = šakānu, “to set up, to
erect.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
There are many items in this prayer that we could discuss comparatively
with the Hebrew Bible, but space only permits a few suggestions. 1
Lines 2 and 38 of our prayer compare Marduk to a father (abu). 2 Several
texts in the Hebrew Bible also imagine Yahweh as a father (‫ב‬ ‫)א‬:
to Israel as a
people (e.g., Deut 32:6, Isa 63:16, 64:7, Jer 3:19, 31:9, Mal 2:10, and 3:17), to
their king (e.g., 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 89:7, and compare Ps 2:7, in which Yahweh
says, “you are my son, today I have fathered you” [‫יָך‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ְ‫י‬, cognate to Akk. alādu
in lines 38–39]), and to individuals within Israel (e.g., Prov 3:12). Although it
provides another example of Yahweh as father to the individual, Ps 103:13 is
particularly striking in its similarities to the sentiments of abu rēmēnû, “merciful
father,” in line 2 of our prayer: ‫יו‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ֵ ְ‫ל־י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ל־בּ‬
‫ע‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫כּ‬,
“as a father
shows mercy (‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֵ ‫ר‬, ַ D inf., cognate to Akk. rēmēnû) to (his) children, (so) Yahweh
shows mercy to those who fear him.” The comparable use of parental or fatherly
imagery for a deity in Israel and Mesopotamia should not be understood in
terms of cultural diffusion or borrowing. Rather, the use of parental imagery is
rooted in an anthropomorphizing model of deity that clarifies certain divine
attributes via analogy with a common, basic social reality: loving parents.
A rhetorical question in lines 8–9 of our prayer broaches the topic of human
ignorance of sin (see also line 18), a common motif in Mesopotian prayer. 3 Ps
19:13 contains a very similar idea in the form of a rhetorical question: ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫יאוֹת‬ ‫ג‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ְ
‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫קּ‬ ֵ ַ‫נ‬ ‫רוֹת‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ס‬ ְ ִ‫נּ‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ין‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ָ‫י‬, “Who can discern (one’s) errors? Acquit me of hidden sins” (con-
trast Ps 51:5, where the supplicant is quite aware of his failing). 4 Although the
question in this verse is almost identical to what we see in line 9 of our prayer,
the biblical petition does not have the same tone as the petitions of the Akkadi-
an prayer. Rather, in the psalm the measure for understanding the depths of
one’s failings as well as the means to achieve obedience are revealed in the Torah
(vv. 8–12). The petition in v. 13 and those in vv. 14–15, therefore, seem to be
uttered by a supplicant confident about the deity’s will and requirements; this
1
Many broad thematic studies could be suggested. For example, Marduk’s epithet qarrādu,
“warrior,” suggests a comparison with the Hebrew Bible’s depiction of Yahweh as divine warrior.
The penitential theme of the entire prayer suggests a comparison with the Penitential Psalms
(Pss 6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143), among others. And the sentiments expressed in lines 11–15 of
our prayer represent a rather pessimistic view on divine–human relations, bringing to mind for
different reasons both the primeval curse on the original humans in Gen 3 and the grim outlook
on everyday life expressed in Qoh 1:13–15. As interesting as they are, these topics are too large
and involved to consider here.
2
Contrast line 39, where Marduk is compared to a mother.
3
Line 10 changes the subject significantly, asking rhetorically if there is anyone without sin. The
question and implied answer are not so much an excuse for sin as a basis for mercy. See Ps
130:3, which asks a similar rhetorical question for the same purpose. See also, e.g., 1 Kgs 8:46,
for the idea that no one is without sin in a context dealing with supplication.
4
See also Ps 90:8 for another psalm that mentions secret sins. For a brief discussion of secret sin,
the human propensity for sin, and adolescent sins in the Hebrew Bible, see van der Toorn, Sin
and Sanction, 97–99.308stands in contrast to what line 11 in our Akkadian prayer suggests. This interpre-
tation is supported by the epithets the psalmist uses in v. 15 for the deity: ‫י‬ ‫צוּר‬
‫י‬ ִ‫ל‬ ‫ֹא‬ ֲ ‫ג‬ ְ‫ו‬, “my rock and my redeemer.” But seeing this confidence in Ps 19 is not to
suggest that such an attitude was pervasive throughout all of Israel at all times.
In fact, the stress and anxiety one reads in the biblical laments of the individual
suggest that supplicants often were uncertain about the reasons for their prob-
lems—much like our Akkadian-speaking supplicant.
The phrase itâ etēqu, used in line 17, literally means “to cross a boundary”
but may also have a more ethically-charged meaning in some contexts, “to
transgress.” A similar semantic range exists in the use of the BH root ‫עבר‬. For
example, in Job 14:6 ‫עבר‬ with ‫חֹק‬ as its object means “to cross a boundary or
limit”: ‫בוֹר‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ַ‫י‬ ‫לֹא‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ית‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫יו‬ ‫קּ‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ֻ , “you have made his limits that he cannot cross.” But
other objects may be used with the verb to bring out the ethical idea more ex-
plicitly and to identify what one has transgressed (as is sometimes the case with
Akkadian etēqu, see CAD E, 389). Thus, for example, one may illicitly cross or
transgress a commandment (‫ה‬ ָ‫ו‬ ‫צ‬ ְ ‫מ‬,
e.g., Deut 26:13, 2 Chron 24:20, and Esth 3:3
[of a human king]), a covenant (‫ית‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫בּ‬,
e.g., Deut 17:2, Judg 2:20, Josh 7: 11, 15,
23:16, and Jer 34:18), divine instruction(s) ( ‫ה‬ ‫תּוֹר‬
/ ‫ֹת‬ ‫תּוֹר‬ , e.g., Dan 9:11, Isa
24:5), or the word of Yahweh (‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫פּ‬,
e.g., Num 14:41, 22:18, 1 Sam 15:24, Prov
8:29 [‫יו‬ ‫)]פ‬.
Given the fact that Israel is often addressed in the Bible as a group, it
should be no surprise that many of the biblical references talk about collective
transgression (but see Esth 3:3).

A Shuilla: Marduk 2
K YLE G REENWOOD
M ARDUK :
See page 291.
T HE P RAYER : 1
Like other shuilla-prayers, this prayer to Marduk consists of an introductory
hymn (lines 1–9), a petition (lines 12–20 [13–21]), and a benediction (lines 21–
25 [25–27]). 2 The prayer concludes with a ritual formula. Abusch has outlined
the structure of the entire prayer as follows:
I. Introductory Hymn (1–9)
A. Capsule Shuilla (10–11) [10–12]
II. Prayer for Success (12–20) [13–21]
Aʹ. Capsule Shuilla (21–22) [22–24]
III. Concluding Benediction (23–25) [25–27]
Unlike other shuilla-prayers, this prayer has two summary statements, one im-
mediately preceding the petition and one immediately following the petition.
If the prayer were indeed chiastic in structure, one would expect the central
literary unit to display some of the characteristics of the entire unit. In fact, this
is very much the case. One can readily appreciate the prayer’s grammatical so-
phistication.

This brief introduction draws upon Tzvi Abusch’s thorough and insightful literary analysis of

Not only is there balance in the verbal forms, but there is concentric movement
in the person of the verbal forms: 1–2–3–3–3–3–2–1. 3 Furthermore, this balance
is evident in the themes: success  acceptance; mouth, mind  speak, hear, obey;
courtier and attendant  protective god; god  goddess. Within the framework of
the petition, the supplicant requests success and protection, which come hand-
in-hand. In order to receive protection from his personal deities, the supplicant
must be successful in his moral and religious obligations.
Two summary statements (lines 10–11 [10–12], 21–22 [22–24]) flank the
petition section. The inclusion of the summary statements is a deviation from the
standard shuilla-prayer structure. However, they serve two important literary
functions. First, as Abusch notes, these summaries or “capsules” consist of two
parallel sections with shared vocabulary and forms.
Invocation:
Marduk bēlu rabû (ilu rēmēnû)  Marduk bēlu rabû
Prayer for Life:
ina qibītīka kitti lubluṭ lušlim-ma  napištī qīša balāṭ napištīya qibi
Promise of Service:
luštammar ilūtka  maḫarka namriš atalluka lušbi
In each case, the capsule both introduces and is distinct from the prayer section
that immediately follows. Moreover, each capsule is constructed along the norms
of a regular shuilla-prayer: hymn (invocation), petition, benediction. Second,
since they are parallel with each other, these capsules broaden the chiastic struc-
ture displayed in the petition section.
At the outermost edges of the chiasm are the introductory hymn and bene-
diction. The hymnic introduction, lines 1–9, consists of three stanzas of three
lines each. According to Abusch, “the first stanza emphasized city and temple;
the second, temple and human life; the third stanza serves both to broaden Mar-
duk’s focus of concern and action as well as to bring together again locality,
temple, and human community—but this time on a higher level of generaliza-
tion” (8). This introduction functions to convey Marduk’s expansion from local
deity and divine offspring to universal and supreme god. The benediction recalls
the main theme addressed in the introductory hymn. Marduk is a universal deity
with historical connections to the great gods of Eridu.
The overall effect of the structure is to create a literary version of a presen-
tation scene, a glyptic motif commonly seen on Mesopotamian cylinder seals.
The supplicant prepares to meet Marduk in the center of the petition section. He
then meets Marduk in the two capsules, at which point he would present his

315
offerings. Finally, in the outer bands of the prayer, he praises the deity as one
worthy of his offerings.
As is the case with other incantation-prayers in this volume, this shuilla
was utilized in lustration rituals. The king would recite this and other incanta-
tions as part of the royal ceremonies of Bīt mēseri, “House of Detention,” and Bīt
rimki, “House of Ablution,” in the hope of counteracting the evil effects wrought
by impurity, thereby restoring his health.
The textual tradition for Marduk 2 is extensive. 4 The benefits of such a
broad corpus are invaluable. Of course, this leads to certain inconsistencies
among the MSS . In addition to the expected textual variants, some MSS lack the
formulaic conclusion. Furthermore, there are some discrepancies in line number-
ing. For the purposes of this volume and due to the fact that an up-to-date edi-
tion that utilizes all of the MSS is lacking, this treatment follows Ebeling’s edition,
which is based on KAR 59. Other MSS will be used only selectively to fill its gaps
or to provide better readings.

ÉN

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word only marks the point at
which the prayer begins; it is not part of the prayer itself. The prayer begins with a series
of epithets. Gašru, “strong, powerful, outstanding,” and šūpû, “splendid, famous, great,
brilliant,” are both ms adjectives modifying etellu, “pre-eminent one, prince, lord.” ERI . DU 10
is the Sumerian rendering of Eridu, a city in Southern Babylonia. According to the Sumeri-
an King List and the so-called Eridu Genesis, the office of kingship descended from heaven
and was first established at Eridu.

Line 2: NUN = rubû, “prince,” is a common epithet in royal inscriptions (see M. J.
Seux, Épithètes royales akkadiennes et sumériennes [Paris: Letouzey et ANÉ, 1967], 251–56).
Tizqāru (tizqaru), “supreme, exalted, prominent.” Bukru, “son, offspring.” Nudimmud is an
epithet for the god better known as Enki in Sumerian and Ea in Akkadian (see page 227).
In the Eridu Genesis (also known as the Ziusudra Epic), Nudimmud was appointed as the
patron deity of Eridu. The phrase bukur Nudimmud recalls the mythologies in which Mar-
duk is identified as the son of Nudimmud. Thus, lines 1–2 invoke the memory of Marduk’s
historical significance in the Babylonian pantheon.
rubû tizqāru bukur Nudimmud
Line 3: d AMAR . UTU , “bull-calf of the sun/storm,” is one of several designations for
Marduk (see page 291). The adjective šalbābu, “wise” is a common epithet for Marduk.
Ruššu (D of râšu), “to give cause for rejoicing, celebration.” This participle presumably
refers to the anonymous worshippers of Marduk at É-engur-ra. This temple, whose Sumeri-
an name means “House of the Sweet Waters,” is not attested elsewhere as a temple of
Marduk. However, it is known to be the name for temples of Inana and Nanshe, as well as
a dais for Ea at E-sagil (see A. R. George, House Most High: The Temples of Ancient Mesopo-
tamia [Mesopotamian Civilizations 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993], #248). The five
participles in lines 3–7 are used substantively as epithets of the deity.
Marduk šalbābu murīš E-engura
Line 4: EN = bēlu, “lord.” É-sag-íl, “House Whose Top is High,” was the Sumerian
name of Marduk’s temple in Babylon (George, House Most High, #967). Tukultu, “trust,
object of trust, support.” KÁ . DINGIR . RA ki = Bābili, “Babylon.” There are other orthographies
attested for the name of Babylon in the various MSS , e.g., E ki and báb-ì-lí.
bēl E-sagil tukulti Bābili
Line 5: Râmu, “to love.” É-zi-da, which means “True House” in Sumerian, was known
primarily as a temple for Nabu, but Marduk was venerated periodically at a temple by this
name in Borsippa (George, House Most High, #1236). Šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to preserve,
to keep well.” Napištu and balāṭu (see line 6) are parallel terms meaning “life.” Taking line
21 into consideration, balāṭu has been translated as “health” in an effort to remain faithful
to the Akkadian nuances.
rāʾim E-zida mušallim napišti
Line 6: Ašarēdu (ašaridu), “foremost, prominent.” TI . LA = balāṭu, “life, health.” The
phrase mudeššû balāṭi does not translate smoothly. The D stem participle of dešû, “to be or𒌋𒐌 A S HUILLA : M ARDUK 2

become abundant,” denotes causation of abundance. In terms of one’s life or well-being,
the English verb “invigorate” provides a close approximation to the original intent. É-maḫ-
ti-la was the Sumerian name of Marduk’s throne in E-sagil (George, House Most High,
#735). Most MSS preserve a Sumerian word play in lines 5–6 between the name of the
temple in the first stichos and Marduk’s relationship to humanity in the second. Thus, é-zi-

Line 7: Ṣulūlu, “roof, protection.” Gamālu, “to do a favor, to be kind to, to spare, to
save.” UN = nišū, “people.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “broad, expansive, wide.” Nišī
rapšāti literally means, “an extensive people,” connoting that the people are vast in num-
ber and widespread in geography. Nišū is a feminine noun, hence the feminine ending on
the adjective.
ṣulūl māti gāmil nišī rapšāti
Line 8: UŠUMGAL (= ušumgallu) is composed of the two signs GAL-UŠUM. Its primary
definition is “great dragon,” or “great serpent.” This word was a royal and divine epithet,
meaning “omnipotent, sovereign.” Kališ, “all, everywhere.” BARAG is a Sumerian word that
comes into Akkadian as parakku, meaning “dais, sanctuary, chapel.”
ušumgal kališ parakkī
Line 9: In the ancient world šumu, “name,” entailed the identity of the one possessing
the name. The ability to speak the deity’s name gave the supplicant an element of control
over that deity. The supplicant is confessing to Marduk that those who know the deity’s
name are properly handling that name. Ina pī literally means “in the mouth of,” but the
idiom works best in English as “on the lips of.” Ṭâbu, “to be(come) good, sweet, favora-
ble.” The form here is a G 3ms predicative.
šumka kališ ina pī nišī ṭāb
Line 10: Rēmēnû, “merciful.” Capsule A of lines 10–11, with its renewed invocation
(see line 3), forms a transition between the opening hymn and the petition section of the
prayer.
Marduk bēlu rabû ilu rēmēnû
Line 11: Line 11 contains three consecutive 1cs precatives, as indicated by the lu–
preformative, rather than li– (see also the end of line 12). Kīnu (m), kittu (f), “true, just,
correct, steadfast.” MSS vary with regard to this adj. Variants include kabitti, “heavy, se-
vere, weighty,” and ṣīrti, “exalted, supreme, august.” Luštammar is in the Gt stem, from
šamāru, “to extol, praise.” Note the abstract ending (–ūt) on ilu, rendering the noun as31812. e-ma ú-ṣa-am-ma-ru lu-uk-šu-ud

“divinity” or “god-ness.” Recall that clauses joined by –ma are logically connected. Since
lušlim-ma is followed by another injunctive form, we should understand luštammar ilūtka as
a resultative clause.
ina qibītīka kitti lubluṭ lušlim-ma luštammar ilūtka
Line 12: The particle ēma, “whatever,” introduces a dependent clause, which is con-
cluded by uṣammaru, a 1cs durative of ṣummuru (D of ṣamāru), “to strive for, to aim, to
plan.” The –u suffix is the subjunctive marker. Kašādu, “to reach, to achieve.” In military
contexts, the verb implies victory; that is, the army reaches its goal.
ēma uṣammaru lukšud
Line 13: Šakānu, “to put, to place, to establish.” Kittu, “truth, justice, steadfastness,” is
a noun and should be distinguished semantically from the homonym, a fem. adj., in line
12. “Place truth” is a common way of speaking about one’s desire for a god to establish the
right thing in a particular situation. Here the supplicant wants Marduk to give the right
words to say so they can find the social success that they presently lack. Having received
this truth, the supplicant may be better positioned for successful intercession.
šuškin kitti ina pīya
Line 14: Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to cause to be, to create.” INIM = amātu (awātum), “word,
matter.” SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f), “good, favorable.” Note the parallel structure of
lines 13 and 14: imperative, noun, prepositional phrase.
šubši amāta damiqti ina libbīya
Line 15: Tīru and nanzāzu are interchangeable terms referring to people of social
prominence, “courtier, attendant.” Qabû, “to speak, to utter, to pronounce, to report.”
Damiqtu, “favor, goodwill, goodness,” is a noun and should be distinguished from the
homonym, a fem. adj., in line 14. Damiqta qabû literally means “to speak good will, favor,”
but may be translated idiomatically as “to intercede” (see CAD D, 64). The supplicant’s
desire is that the divinely placed “good word” will be received by the social elites, who
will then intercede on his behalf.
tīru u nanzāzu liqbû damiqtī
Line 16: MU is a logogram for the 1cs pronominal suffix. One should read it as –ī in
lines 16 and 17 since the nouns are in the nominative case. By contrast, note the –ya suffix
on imnu, “right,” and šumēlu, “left” (see line 17), both of which are in the genitive case.
Izuzzu/uzuzzu, “to stand.” For a detailed study of this verb, see J. Huehnergard, “Izuzzum
and Itūlum,” in Riches Hidden in Secret Places: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Memory of
Thorkild Jacobsen (ed. Tzvi Abusch; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2002), 161–85. Lines 16–𒌋𒐌 A S HUILLA : M ARDUK 2

17 introduce a significant feature of ancient Near Eastern religion. The common person did
not have access to the great royal temples. Thus, individuals sought a personal god or
goddess. The term “to acquire a god” (Akk. ila rašû; Sum. lú-dingir tuk) is synonymous
with what we would call luck or fortune (CAD I/J, 101). Since misfortune, such as illness
or disease, was thought to have derived from demons, the personal deities, standing on the
right and left, may have served an apotropaic function, thus ensuring good luck. For more
on the personal deities, see page 431.
ilī lizziz ina imnīya
Line 17: The divine number for Ishtar is 15. In this case, 15 = ištaru, used generically
to refer to the supplicant’s personal goddess. GÙB = šumēlu, “left side.”
ištarī lizziz ina šumēlīya
Line 18: Šullumu (D of šalāmu), see line 5. The participle mušallimu functions as an at-
tributive adjective modifying ilu. Kayyān, “constantly, regularly.” Lū, “let (it) be.” Á = idu,
“arm, side, strength.”
ilu mušallimu ina idīya lū kayyān
Line 19: Šurkam-ma is a G impv. from the root šarāku, “to grant” with ventive (–am)
and enclitic –ma. The impv. precedes three infinitives in the accusative case serving as
direct objects of the finite verb. Šemû, “to hear.” Magāru, “to follow an order, to obey” (see
CAD M/I, 34). There is some discrepancy in the exemplars on the final sign of the line.
KAR 59 reads RI, while other MSS read RU or RA. Following King and Meier, the accusative
reading has been adopted here.
šurkam-ma qabâ šemâ u magāra
Line 20: Aqabbû is a 1 cs G present with the subjunctive –u. GIM = kīma, “as, like.”
Because amāt is in the bound form, its syntactical function is to introduce the dependent
clause. The 3fs form of the predicative, magrat, is used for agreement with its subject, the
feminine noun amātu.
amāt aqabbû kīma aqabbû lū magrat
Line 21: Qīša (qâšu, “to give, to bestow”) and qibi are both ms imperatives. When re-
ferring to the gods, qabû often has the meaning, “to give an order, decree.” TI . LA = balāṭu,
see line 6. Balāṭ napištīya, lit. “good health of my life,” is an objective genitive construc-
tion. That is, balāṭu is not equivalent to napištī, but is manifest in it. Lines 21–22, comprise
the prayer’s third invocation, capsule Aʹ.

Line 22: Namriš, “brilliantly, splendidly.” Note the terminative-adverbial ending (–iš),
indicating the manner in which the action of the verb is to be enacted. As a manner of
walking, namriš has the sense of “radiantly” as in “a bright mood” (CAD N/I, 239). Maḫru
(= IGI ), “front, presence.” Atalluka is a Gtn stem infinitive of alāku in the accusative case,
meaning “to walk about, to roam about.” It is the object of the precative lušbi (šebû, “to be
satisfied, to be full”). For more on the Akkadian use of maḫar atalluku, see M. Weinfeld,
“The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient Near East,” JAOS 90
(1970), 185–88. Lines 22–25 utilize a series of precatives to communicate the essence of
the prayer.
maḫarka namriš atalluka lušbi
Line 23: The two precatives from hadû and râšu, both meaning “to rejoice (in/over),”
are synonyms in parallel construction. Enlil (Akk. Ellil) is one of the most significant dei-
ties in Mesopotamia. In Sumerian mythology, he was known as ab-ba-dingir-re-ne, “father
of the gods.” His consort was Ninlil and together they bore many important deities, such as
Adad, Nanna-Suen, Nergal, Nusku, and Shamash. Given the long, rich history of the an-
cient Near East, it is understandable that traditions regarding its many deities were not
uniform. In some texts, Enlil was considered a descendent of Anu. Elsewhere, he was
deemed a son of Ea. In either case, both Enlil and Ea are extremely important deities in the
Babylonian pantheon. That they might rejoice over Marduk would be considered the high-
est of complements to the deity.
Ellil liḫdūka Ea lirīška
Line 24: The reading kiššatum in KAR 59 is less desirable, since mimation is not at-
tested elsewhere in the text and because one would expect the genitive case ending. There-
fore, the present text follows BMS 9 and KAR 23. Kiššatu is a political, rather than cosmo-
logical term. It refers to the dominion of kings and deities in the inhabited world. Karābu,
“to greet (with a blessing), to beseech,” is the root of a common Akkadian word for prayer,
ikribu.
ilū ša kiššati likrubūka
Line 25: Ilū rabûtu may refer to Enlil and Ea, since they are the nearest antecedents.
However, this phrase generally refers to the divine council. The great gods seem to serve
both a generic and a specific purpose, particularly in royal inscriptions. There the divine
council may represent the entire pantheon available to the king, or it may refer to those
specific deities relevant to the king for accomplishing a specific purpose. These purposes
may include military aid or the protection of sacred structures (see Kyle R. Greenwood,
“The Hearing Gods of the Assyrian Royal Inscriptions,” JANER 10 (2010), 211–18). Liṭibbū
is a 3mp precative from ṭubbu (D of ṭâbu), “to do something well, to satisfy.”

Line 26: This line is the prayer’s rubric, which tells about the text’s classification. In
this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is directed. As is typi-
cal, the rubric is written in Sumerian.
Line 27: DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” KEŠDA = riksu, lit. means “knot, binding,”
but in ritual contexts it carries the connotation of arranging the show table with food and
drink, that is, offerings, for the deity. The word is generally translated as “ritual arrange-
ment” (CAD R, 351–52). NÍG . NA = nignakku, “incense burner.” DÙ = epēšu, “to do, to
make.” Šumma . . . šumma is a syntactical construction indicating “either . . . or.” In its
present context, it signifies two options for performing the ritual. This line is a variation of
an abbreviated ritual instruction commonly found in shuillas. It probably serves as the
catchphrase to a fuller ritual, which the exorcist would recall and perform from memory
(see Mayer, UFBG, 119, n.3).

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Many comparisons could be made between the epithets of Marduk and
those of Yahweh. Most are easily recognizable, such as prince (Isa 9:6), protec-
tion (Ps 41:2; 121:7; 146:9), salvation (Gen 49:18; Ps 3:8; Mic 7:7), support (2
Sam 22:19  Ps 18:18; 2 Chr 16:9), and wise (Job 9:4; 28:12–23; Prov 2:6).
However, the epithet tukulti Bābili has an interesting parallel with BH, ‫יּוֹן‬ ‫צ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬,
“stronghold of Zion.” Tukultu and ‫ה‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬ ְ are not semantic equivalents, but they
connote similar concepts. The former literally means, “support, trust, reliance,”
while the latter means, “stronghold” or “fortress.” According to biblical tradi-
tion, ‫יּוֹן‬ ִ‫צ‬ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬ ְ was the original name for Jerusalem (2 Sam 5:7  1 Chr 11:5) pri-
or to its conquest by David. Upon the completion of the temple, Jerusalem be-
came the locus of Israel’s deity. Thus, Zion was recognized as the holy mountain
(Joel 4:17), Yahweh’s throne (Ps 9:12) and dwelling place (Ps 76:3), the place
where Yahweh’s name dwelled (Isa 18:7) and whence his name shined forth (Ps
50:2). Although the actual phrase ‫יּוֹן‬ ‫צ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬ ְ only occurs in the two aforemen-
tioned verses, the notion that Yahweh was the source of Zion’s strength and sup-
port occurs elsewhere. In Ps 31:3, the psalmist cries out to Yahweh that the deity
would be ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫יע‬
‫ֺשׁ‬ ִ ‫הו‬ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ֺת‬ ‫צוּדו‬ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫ית‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ “as a fortress to save me.” The same idea is present
elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, as well (e.g., Ps 9:9; 18:2; Jer 16:19; Joel 4:16;
Nah 1:7). In the same way, Marduk is the source of support and trust for the city
of Babylon and for all who worshipped him.
The idea of the personal god is not foreign to the biblical authors, although
evidence of a personal goddess is not forthright. This is not to say that Yahweh
or Elohim were only considered personal gods. Such an assertion could not be
substantiated. However, there are instances where the theology of the personal
god was, at the very least, in the background. Certainly, the ancestral narratives322were cognizant of the idea. In the Old Akkadian period, one way of referring to
the personal god was il abi, “the god of the father,” or “ancestral deity.” This
should immediately call to mind the biblical phrase ‫י‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ‫א‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ , “the god of my
father,” or more specifically ‫קֹב‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫י‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ק‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫צ‬ ְ ִ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫א‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ , “the god of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob” (e.g. Exod 3:16). In fact, Jacob had some uncertainty whether or not
he would claim Yahweh as his own personal god, placing stipulations on his
commitment. If Jacob would return safely on his quest for a wife, ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬
‫ים‬ ‫אֹלה‬
‫ל‬,
“then Yahweh will become my deity” (Gen 28:21). Another example
from the Pentateuch is found in the account of Rachel and Laban. As Rachel
leaves her father’s home, she absconds his ‫ים‬ ‫פ‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫תּ‬ ְ (Gen 31:19). While there is
some degree of uncertainty over the precise meaning of this term, the underly-
ing idea inherent in most suggestions is that it refers to the personal or house-
hold god. 1 If its etymology is rooted in ‫רפא‬, “to heal,” 2 then the term fits well
with the ancients’ expectations of a personal god. Finally, Ps 22 may need to be
considered in light of the belief in the personal god: ‫חוֹק‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ְ ַ‫ז‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫ה‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫י‬ ִ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ
‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ָ‫ג‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫דּ‬ ִ ‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫ישׁוּע‬
‫מ‬,
“My god, my god, why have you abandoned me? Why are my
groans so far from my deliverance?” The supplicant cries out to their deity, in
this case Yahweh, as one who is under attack from disease, i.e., evil spirits, and
is in desperate need of protection from this affliction.
Additionally, we find in the phrase maḫarka namriš atalluka (line 22) several
interesting parallels. First, namriš derives from nawāru (> namāru). In Biblical
Hebrew this root appears in noun form as ‫ר‬ ֵ‫נ‬ (from ‫)נור‬, “lamp.” The u-class me-
dial vowel has been retained in the derivative noun ‫ה‬ ‫ֺר‬ ָ ‫נו‬ ‫מ‬,
“lampstand.” Second,
the Gtn infinitive atalluku corresponds directly to the Hebrew hitpael (Gtn)
‫ך‬ ‫לּ‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬.
Furthermore, maḫarka atalluku is analogous to ‫י‬ ַ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ך‬ ‫לּ‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ (Gen 17:1). The
reflexive form of the verbs indicates repetitive, habitual action. Examples of this
phrase are attested in Gen 24:40 and 48:15. Third, several of the psalms express
the idea communicated in the phrase. Psalm 16:11 says, “You inform me of the
way of life. Your presence is the fullness of joy. Good fortune is in your right
hand forever.” Even more striking is Ps 43, a psalm of lament with a similar
theme as Capsule Aʹ of our prayer. Verse 4 reads, “Then I will go to the altar of
God; to God, the source of my joy. I will praise you on the lyre, O God, my god.”
In both of these examples the psalmists articulate the same sentiment as the
supplicant in our prayer to Marduk. That is, living in the presence of the deity
brings immeasurable joy to the life of the worshiper.

A Shuilla: Nabu 1
A LAN L ENZI
N ABU :
A Babylonian scribal god hailing from Borsippa, Nabu was the son of Mar-
duk and a major god in the post-OB Mesopotamian pantheon. His consort was
Tashmetu. Although attested already in the early second millennium, we can
trace Nabu’s rise to prominence only starting in the later second millennium. His
status in the pantheon reached its zenith during the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-
Babylonian periods, as attested by the several temples and shrines dedicated to
him in many major Assyrian and Babylonian cities (e.g., Nineveh, Nimrud,
Borsippa, and Babylon). Personal names are further proof of his importance.
Nabu was the most common deity invoked in Neo-Assyrian theophoric names
and second only to Marduk in first millennium Babylonia. Note especially the
Neo-Babylonian royal names Nebuchadnezzar (Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur, “O Nabu,
guard my firstborn”) and Nabonidus (Nabû-naʾid, “Nabu is praised”).
Archaeologists have uncovered tablets in several of Nabu’s É-zi-da temples
(“The True House”). The Nimrud finds are especially impressive, which have
yielded copies of the Succession Treaty of Esarhaddon (see SAA 2, no. 6) in a
throne room and about three hundred tablets of literary content in the temple’s
library (see CTN IV). 1 Tablets found in libraries at Ashur, Nineveh, and Huzirina
(modern Sultan Tepe) bear formulaic colophons that clearly demonstrate scribal
devotion to Nabu (e.g., Hunger, BAK, nos. 233, 318, and 353, the latter of which
reads tākilka ul ibâš Nabû, “the one who trusts in you, O Nabu, will not be put to
shame”).
In keeping with his function as the scribe of the gods, Nabu was represented
by a stylus or wedge in iconography. Celestially, he is associated with the planet
Mercury. He is mentioned by name in the Bible in Isa 46:1.

Imperial City Revealed (London: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2001), 203–10.
325326T HE P RAYER :
The prayer adapts the typical three-part structure of shuillas. It starts with
the customary hymnic introduction in lines 1–11. Line 12 contains the usual self-
identification formula and recognition of the supplicant’s humble position in
relation to the deity (“the servant who fears you”). Lines 13–20 comprise the
prayer’s petition section, thematically-centered on the supplicant’s old age. A
description of piety (lines 13–14) precedes the complaint (lines 15–18). A reca-
pitulation of the invocation follows in line 19 (compare with line 1) just before
the prayer’s very brief petition proper in line 20. The prayer concludes with a
one line formulaic promise of future praise (line 21).
Joel Hunt has recognized a tri-partite structure to the opening hymn based
on grammatical and thematic features. In lines 1–5 substantives and participial
phrases that describe Nabu’s character predominate. These lines present a time-
less portrait of Nabu’s attributes. In Lines 6–8 complete sentences using third
person verbs describe Nabu’s word, his relationship to his father, Marduk, and
thus his position within the hierarchy of the gods. Finally, lines 9–10, using
complete sentences and second person verbs (if one follows Mayer’s MS B in line
9), characterize Nabu as one willing and able to help a supplicant with angry
personal deities. The use of second person verbs in this final part of the hymn
begins a transition between the hymnic introduction and the petition section.
Although its structure is fairly typical, the prayer offers a couple of points of
literary interest. I have already mentioned how line 19 near the end of the pray-
er, positioned between lament and petition, re-invokes the deity with words that
recall the first line. Notice also that the use of the words “days” and “years” in
line 17, part of the lament, recalls the vocabulary of line 3, part of the hymnic
introduction. The employment of the verb ṣabātu, “to seize, hold,” in line 20
harks back to the same verb in line 2, if the restoration is correct: Nabu holds his
stylus; the supplicant seizes Nabu’s prayer. Finally, just as Nabu is the one who
opens the ear (line 2) to receive divine insight, the supplicant is the one who
opens their hands (line 14) in prayer (for a possible pun, see the notes on line
14). It seems the prayer re-uses the vocabulary of the first few lines throughout
the remainder of the prayer, but especially toward its conclusion, thereby giving
the prayer a certain coherence with regard to language.
The prayer presents the supplicant as an elderly person (lines 14 and 17),
perhaps one who has lived a life of devotion (line 13). Despite their humility
before the gods and humans (?, lines 15–16), they feel they have not received
the favor and mercy due them (line 18). The precise nature and origin of the
mistreatment—whether from the gods or humans or both—are not entirely
clear. But one might infer from lines 9–10 that the anger of the supplicant’s per-
sonal gods is involved. One might also consider, in light of the supplicant’s years
having come to an end (line 17), that the supplicant worries about their impend-
ing death. In any case, the supplicant wishes to be set free from that which is
troubling them (line 20). There is little more that can be said without indulging
in speculation.𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

Two of the three MSS used in Mayer’s edition (A and B) preserve ritual in-
structions, though Mayer himself did not include them in his edition (see
Ebeling, AGH, 12, who provides several conjectural restorations). Unfortunately,
both tablets are broken or abraded in the same area of the ritual instructions,
leaving us with an incomplete picture of the actions prescribed. What does seem
relatively clear is the setting up of censors and having the supplicant repeat
some of the words of the prayer. The final act is a prostration, a fitting gesture of
subordination as one leaves the presence of a superior.
One final comment: The colophons of MSS A and B indicate that the tablets
were copied by young scribes (šamallû ṣeḫru), perhaps wishing to make a good
impression on their patron deity (see Hunger, BAK, nos. 235 and 395). 2

Mayer’s MS A (KAR 25 +) contains the following shuillas: Nabu 1, Marduk 2, 18, 19, Nabu 2,
Sin 9, and Enlil 1b, in that order, followed by a fourteen-line colophon, in which a very proud
young scribe traces his genealogy back several generations. MS B (STT 55) contains Marduk 2
and Nabu 1, followed by a fragmentary, one line colophon.

[ ÉN d A ] G ? reš-tu-ú IBILA ke-e-nu
Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” This word marks the beginning of the prayer. It is
not a part of the prayer itself. d AG = Nabû. There is no question that this prayer is directed
to Nabu (see lines 7, 19, and 22). There is, however, some question as to whether the text
actually indicates this by stating the deity’s name at its beginning (the sign read as AG
here is partly broken). Rēštû, “firstborn, preeminent.” One’s semantic decision should be
based on the whole line, especially the meaning of IBILA . For confirmation, see the usage in
CAD R, 275, which cites this lexeme in other contexts alongside māru and aplu. IBILA =
aplu, “heir, son.” Kēnu (kīnu), “true.” Here, the word denotes legitimacy, as in the “true
heir.”

Line 2: Ṣabātu, “to seize, to hold.” GI = qanû, “reed” (qan = bound form). Ṭuppu,
“tablet.” One should translate the words “the reed of the tablet” in light of the material
culture of the Mesopotamian scribe. With what did scribes write? Note the sound play
between kēnu and qan in lines 1 and 2, respectively. Is this significant? Note also the use of
kittu, the feminine form of kēnu, in the following phrase said of Nabu: ṣābit-ma qan ṭuppu
kittu, “(Nabu), who holds the proper stylus” (cited in CAD K, 393). BAD = pītu, “opening”
(lit.); or BAD = petû, “to open.” Ḫasissu is usually written ḫasīsu (see CDA, 109, CAD Ḫ,
126, and the variant in Mayer’s MS C: ḫa-si-[si]), “aperture of the ear, understanding.” BAD
may be understood as either the noun pītu or a participle, pētû, “the one who opens.” The
former interpretation yields pīt ḫasissi, literally, “opening of the ear,” which denotes ex-
traordinary intelligence (CAD P, 446). Here the phrase would imply that extraordinary
intelligence is an attribute of the deity and is related to or possibly a result of Nabu’s
scribal ability. But what is one to do with the phonetic complement –u? The latter inter-
pretation ( BAD = pētû) maintains the grammatical parallel with lines 3 and 4 (and the
restoration in line 2) and implies that Nabu, as the paradigmatic scribe, imparts knowledge
to human scribes. The implication of the phrase is revelatory, as Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 8,
using the near synonym uznu, demonstrates: zaqīqu abāl-ma ul upatti uznī, “I prayed to the
dream god, but he did not open my ear.” As for the phonetic complement on BAD , in SB
Akkadian a participle from a III-weak root in construct with a following substantive often
ends with –û (see Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der jungbaby-
lonischen „hymnischen“ Literatur, 2 Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 14/1–2;
Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 1.95).
ṣābit qan ṭuppi pētû ḫasissi
Line 3: UD . MEŠ = ūmū (f. ūmātu), plural(s) of ūmu, “day.” Barû, “to watch over, to
inspect, to observe”; also used technically by scribes in tablet colophons, “to collate.” The
latter usage is not appropriate here, but may provide background information for inter-
preting Nabu’s epithet here in line 3b. MU .( AN . NA .) MEŠ = šanātu, plural of šattu, “year” (see
line 17 also).

Line 4: Eṭēru, “to spare (someone).” Possibly read [na-ṣir], from naṣāru, “to protect, to
guard.” Napištu, “life.” Turru (D of târu) gimilla, “to return a kindness, to avenge.” The
social and literary context in which this phrase is used determines the kind of return one
will receive, good or bad (see CAD G, 74–75 for examples). Given the positive epithet in
line 4a, the returning of a kindness may seem most appropriate. But, one may also enter-
tain the idea that line 4a is directed at the speaker of the prayer while 4b against those
who would threaten the speaker’s life. In this case, avenging may be the best interpreta-
tion. Given the possibilities, one may wish to choose a translation that conveys both posi-𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

tive and negative connotations of the phrase. For example, Nabu is “one who responds to
actions in kind.”

Line 5: SAG . KAL = ašarēdu (ašaridu), “leader, foremost.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.”
Ašarēd ilī is a very common title for various deities in prayers (see CAD A/2, 417). Šumu,
“name.” Kabtu (= DUGUD ), “heavy, weighty, important.” See line 28.
ašarēd ilī šumu kabtu
Line 6: Zikru, “speech, command, name.” The pronominal suffix on zikru refers to
Nabu, who is the center of attention here. Enû, “to change.” The subject for this verb is in
the second part of the line. Bānû, “progenitor, creator.” This term is commonly found in
apposition with abu, “father.” See CAD B, 94.
zikiršu ul enni abu bānûšu
Line 7: d TU . TU = Marduk. DUMU = māru, “son.” Notice the grammatical and semantic
parallel constructions in lines 6 and 7. The verb, ul enni, and the kinship terms, bānû and
māru, occupy the same place in each line, but there is a chiastic pattern in the positions of
zikiršu / zikir Nabû and abu / d TU . TU .
Marduk ul enni zikir Nabû mārīšu
Line 8: Māšu, “twin brother,” is the third kinship term in the last few lines. Mayer’s
B has maš-še-šu (normalized maššêšu). Maššû is a by-form of māšu (see CAD M/1, 401).
How might one understand the idea of the gods as Nabu’s twin brothers? Perhaps he
is/was their equal or peer. Amātu (awātum), “word.” Ṣīru, “august, supreme, exalted,” is a
very common adjective used with divinity (see CAD Ṣ, 210–12). Here the adjective is pre-
dicative (3fs). The exaltation of Nabu’s word in the latter part of the line may indicate his
position of authority over those gods once his peers.
ina ilī māšīšu amāssu ṣīrat
MS
Line 9: Notice the change of person here and in line 10. The prayer now directly ad-
dresses Nabu with second person verbs. Lines 9 and 10 are characterized by strong gram-
matical and semantic parallelism: both begin with relative clauses describing a person
experiencing divine anger (god and goddess, alternately) and then contain a second person
verb plus complement (substantive or prepositional phrase, both ending in –šu). Sabāsu
(more commonly šabāsu), “to be angry.” Suḫḫuru (D of saḫāru), “to turn (away, toward).”
The above text follows Mayer’s MS B, which shows a second person durative verb
(tusaḫḫar); this reading enhances the parallelism between lines 9 and 10. ( MS A has a third330 R EADING A KKADIAN P RAYERS AND H YMNS : A N I NTRODUCTION

person preterite, usaḫḫira.) GÚ = kišādu, “neck.” The š of the 3ms pronominal suffix (–šu)
and the final dental consonant (d) of the noun change to –ss– (–dš– becomes –ss–). To
whom does the pronominal suffix on this word refer? Nabu is the implied subject of
tusaḫḫar. The idiom suḫḫuru kišāda (or pānī), “to turn the neck (or face),” indicates the
direction of the neck’s owner’s attention, away, toward, or back to someone or something,
depending on context. See CAD S, 49–50. In this case, Nabu turns the angry personal god
back to his devotee. While the deity’s attention is directed away from his or her ward, the
individual is open to all kinds of potential evils. Thus it is important for the deity’s face (or
neck) to be turned at all times toward the devotee. For a discussion of the personal god,
see page 431.
ša ilšu isbusu tusaḫḫar kišāssu
Line 10: Zenû, “to be angry.” Zenât is a 3fs predicative form. NAM = šīmtu, “fate.”
Here, however, the term probably refers to an individual’s personal goddess (ištaru), thus
completing the parallelism started in line 9 of the angered personal god. An angry personal
god and goddess is a common motif in Mesopotamian prayers. Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to
reconcile.” Itti, “with.”
ša zenât šīmtašu tusallim ittīšu
Line 11: Mayer’s MS B adds a self-identification formula here in two lines after our
line 10. They are inserted here for sake of interest. Line 11 continues the grammatical and
semantic parallelism of lines 9–10. Arnu, “guilt.” The n of the bound form (aran–) assimi-
lates to the š of the pronominal suffix. Išû, “to have, to own.” Paṭāru, “to release.”
ša arna išû tapaṭṭar araššu
Line 12: NENNI A NENNI = annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so.” This is
a very common phrase in prayers. It serves as a placeholder for the name and filiation of
the person speaking the prayer (as in the phrase, “I, state your name”). Annanna sometimes
also holds the place for the names of a person’s personal god and goddess. ÌR = (w)ardu,
“servant.” The god–devotee relationship is imagined in terms of a king and his servant.
Palāḫu, “to fear.” The presence of this line, a self-presentation formula, at this point in the
prayer clearly signals a transition from hymn to petition.
anāku annanna mār annanna ardu pāliḫka
Line 13: Meṣḫarūtu (meṣḫerūtu), “youth.” How does this word influence one’s under-
standing of the prayer? How does this line fit with the next? Is there a contrast between
youth and old age or does the supplicant intend to show continuity of devotion throughout
life? It is difficult to say because a key word in the line, ma-ši-šu-ti, is obscure (see Hunt,
217–19 for the following options). The text is secure (against CAD M/2, 37), but the mean-
ing is uncertain. Deriving the term from the root mašāšu, “to wipe,” one might understand
the word as mašišūti, an adverbial accusative of condition, and translate it with regard to𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

the end result of wiping, “in a purified condition” (see Mayer, 472, “in gereinigtem
Zustand [?]”). However, the word may describe the wiping action itself rather than its
result. In this case, one might suppose that the supplicant’s hands were constantly moving
about—as if wiping something—while uplifted in prayer (see Karel van der Toorn, Sin and
Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia: A Comparative Study [SSN 22; Assen: Van Gorcum,
1985], 96 and 209, n.22, who translates the word “with ever fidgety hands” and sees a
contrast between youth and old age in lines 11 and 12). Suppû, “to pray.”
ina meṣḫarūtīya ma-ši-šu-ti usappa
Line 14: Šēbu (šību), “old person, elder.” The form is predicative (1cs). Note the life-
cycle contrast with line 13: youth to old age. DÙ = kalû, “all, totality”; but in construct,
kal(a), “all of, the whole of, everyone of.” Upnu, “hand.” Note the dual form with 1cs suf-
fix. Petû upnī, lit. “to open the hands”; more idiomatically, “to pray.” In line 14, upnu is the
subject (upnā is nom. dual) and petâ is 3fp predicative. This phrase may be punning on the
idiom discussed in the notes to line 2, petû uzna. If so, the line may imply that a petû upna,
“opening of the hand,” was one way to receive a petû uzna, “opening of the ear” (i.e., a
divine response). In any case, opening or raising one’s hands was a basic petitionary ritual
gesture in the ancient Near East (see Mayer I. Gruber, Aspects of Nonverbal Communication
in the Ancient Near East [Studia Pohl 12/1; Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1980], 50–59).
This gesture, of course, is closely related to the label that identifies many Mesopotamian
prayers, namely, šu-íl-lá = šuʾillakku, “(prayer of) lifted hands.”
šēbāku ana kal ilī petâ upnāya
Line 15: Lipin appi, lit. “stroking of the nose, prostration.” The word lipnu / libnu is
not recognized by the CAD (see L, 11 labānu); rather, see AHw, 551 or CDA, 182 under
libnu. Karû, “to be(come) short.” Notice the Assyrian form of the 3fs G perfect (with pre-
fixed ta– and harmonization of the second syllable’s vowel). With napaltu (= napaštu),
“life, throat, breath,” as the subject, the verb means, “to be(come) short of breath.” One
may wish to translate this phrase more idiomatically as a first person verb.

(awīlūtum), “humanity.” Kīma, “like, as.” Meḫû, “storm, whirlwind.” Anāku, “I.” How does
one explain this simile? A few suggestions: The simile may be a poetic expansion upon the
person’s breathlessness noted in line 15; it may indicate the speaker’s poor bodily condi-
tion; it may be an attempt to convey the speaker’s tumultuous life in broader human socie-
ty; or, in light of line 17, the simile may indicate the transitory character of the speaker’s
existence. In other contexts, meḫû in similes and metaphors conveys strength, chaos, and
even violence (see CAD M/2, 6). Since similes activate a field of associations, one need not
nail this simile down to one meaning.

Line 17: Notice the similarity between this line and line 3 (if the restoration is cor-
rect). Is the end of the prayer looking back to the beginning? See also line 19, assuming
the correctness of the restorations there. Ittatlakū is a Gt perfect of alāku, “to go, to walk”;
in the Gt, “to go away.” It makes little sense for “days to go away,” so one will need to
choose a verb in the translation that conveys the sense more idiomatically. Qatû, “to come
to an end, to finish.” As the line progresses it shows an intensification, depicted in the
action of the verbs (leaving vs. coming to an end) and the duration of time (days vs.
years). The supplicant, it seems, believes themselves to be as good as dead.
ittatlakū ūmūya šanātūya iqtatâ
Line 18: SIG 5 = dumqu, “good fortune.” Nēmelu, “benefit, gain, profit.” As is common
in SB Akkadian, the nom. stands in place of the expected acc. case. TUKU = rašû, “to ac-
quire.” Since the first verb in the line is a preterite, the one from rašû is likely to be one as
well. Line 18 indicates a general absence of success throughout the speaker’s life.
ul āmur dumqa nēmelu lā arši
Line 19: Gešru (gašru), “powerful, mighty. Used substantively, this word was a very
common epithet for deities in Mesopotamian prayers. This line recapitulates the invocation
at the beginning of the prayer. Given its proximity to the conclusion of the prayer, one
might interpret this line as purely literary, creating a sort of ring structure in the prayer, or
as a rhetorical intensification, increasing the sense of urgency within the prayer. In the
latter case, this line insures the deity’s attention just before stating the petition in the fol-
lowing line.
aplu kēnu Nabû gešru
Line 20: Notice again, if the restorations are correct, the harking back to words from
the beginning of the prayer: ṣabātu also occurs in line 2 (restored). Here the preterite may
have a performative sense, and may thus be best rendered with a present. Si ? -pe-e-ka is
obscure. It may be sīpu, “prayer.” Thus, aṣbat sīpēka, literally, “I seize your prayers”; more
idiomatically, “I pray to you” (see CAD Ṣ, 32 for an analogy). The word may also be sippu,
“doorjamb.” If so, then the line may merely indicate that the speaker has come to Nabu’s
temple for supplication, “I take hold of your (temple’s) doorjambs.” In any case, line 20a
remains uncertain. Kullumu, “to show.” The verb form is a D ms imperative with 1cs suffix:
kullimmanni stands here for kullimanni, as is evident from MS A’ S ritual section, which reads
kul-li-ma-an-ni (see line 29). ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.” (A variant in Mayer’s MS B reads: lūmur
nūru, “let me see the light.”) One may think on first glance to interpret the phrase kulli-
manni nūra, “show me the light,” in terms of a revelatory experience (or perhaps even a
wish for death). The idiom, however, derives from the imagery of a prisoner being set free
from a dark prison cell. See CAD K, 524. In light of Nabu’s ability to turn back the anger of
one’s personal deities (lines 9–10) and in light of the fact that the speaker seems to have𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

had a lifetime without good fortune, it may be that the freedom the speaker seeks is free-
dom from divine displeasure. However, one might also consider, since the speaker believes
themselves to be at the end of their years, that this wish is a desire to be freed from death
itself, the final prison of all the living.

Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and
its object both come from the same root. One should translate this idiomatically, “let me
proclaim your praises” or the like. Shuilla-prayers almost always conclude with some form
of foreword looking praise. The phrases narbīka lušāpi and dalīlīka ludlul are very common-
ly used for this purpose (see CAD A/2, 202–3).
narbīka lušāpi dalīlīka ludlul
Line 22: This line is the rubric, that is, it tells something about the classification of
the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it
is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the
wording of a lifted-hand to Nabu.”
Line 23: DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” KI = qaqqaru, “ground.” SAR = šabāṭu, “to

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
A few idioms in the prayer are worthy of our comparative attention. The
phrase pētû ḫasīsu, “the one who opens the ear,” in line 2 is comparable to the
BH phrase ‫ן‬ ֶ‫אֹז‬ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ח‬ ‫ת‬ ַ ‫פּ‬ ָ , “to open the ear” (Isa 50:5 and 48:8) and the similar ‫ה‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫גּ‬ ָ
‫ן‬ ֶ‫אֹז‬ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬,
“to uncover the ear” (see 1 Sam 9:15, 20:2, 12, 13, 22:8 (2x’s), 22:17, 2
Sam 7:27, Isa 22:14, Job 33:16, 36:10, 15, Ruth 4:4, and 1 Chron 17:25). In ref-
erence to human activity, the Hebrew idioms mean “to inform” (e.g., 1 Sam
20:13). When a deity is the one informing a human, however, the idiom denotes
revelatory activity (e.g., 1 Sam 9:15 and Isa 50:5). The means of conveying the
information may be different (e.g., a dream, prophetic intuition, or the scribal
tradition, as our prayer implies), but the Hebrew and Akkadian phrases desig-
nate the same mythological idea: a deity somehow informs a human of some-
thing he or she would not otherwise have known apart from the deity.𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1
335
Turru (D of târu) gimilla, “to return a kindness, to avenge,” in line 4 com-
pares to the BH phrase ‫מוּל‬ ְ‫גּ‬ ‫יב‬ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ‫ה‬,
“to return in kind,” and ‫מוּל‬ ְ‫גּ‬ ‫ם‬ ‫לּ‬ ֵ ‫שׁ‬,
“to repay in
kind.” As with the Akkadian phrase, the BH phrases can indicate something ei-
ther positive or negative, depending on the situation. The idea is simply that one
receives treatment (i.e., requital) in accord with one’s own actions (see Obad
15). The phrases are usually used negatively, designating a payment of retribu-
tion against evildoers, the proud, or enemies (see, e.g., Ps 28:4, 94:2, Isa 66:6,
Jer 51:6, and Ps 137:8). But the positive use is also attested (see Prov 19:17 and
2 Chron 32:25). For the two phrases in the same context (of requiting an ene-
my), see Joel 4:4.
The idiom suḫḫuru kišāda (or pānī), “to turn the neck (or face) back toward
or away from,” when used negatively (i.e., in the sense of “away from”) com-
pares conceptually 1 to the common BH idea of the deity hiding his face (‫יר‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ
‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬,
see, e.g., Pss 13:2, 27:9, 44:25, 69:18, 88:15, 102:3, and 143:7). As Ps
143:7 indicates, when the deity hides his face, the supplicant feels like one
headed for the grave. The opposite of the deity hiding his face is the deity mak-
ing his face to shine upon, i.e., to be happy with, an individual (‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫יר‬ ‫א‬ ִ ‫ה‬,
see, e.g., Pss 31:17, 67:2, 80:4, 8, 20, 119:135, and of course Num 6:25). As in
Mesopotamia, devotees in ancient Israel desired the protective attention of their
deity at all times.
Turning to a more thematic level of comparison, one can see that our Akka-
dian prayer presents a supplicant advanced in years, perhaps at death’s gates. Ps
71, a lament of the individual, depicts a comparable supplicant and is therefore
related, thematically-speaking. 2 In this psalm the supplicant explicitly recounts
their devotion during not only their youth (vv. 5 and 17) but even from birth (v.
6)! They fear, however, in their old age (‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ִ‫ז‬ ‫ת‬ ‫ע‬,
v. 9a, and ‫ה‬ ‫יב‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ִ‫ז‬, v. 18),
when they most need the deity (‫י‬ ‫ֹח‬ ִ ‫כּ‬ ‫לוֹת‬ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫כּ‬,
“when my strength is failing,” v. 9b),
Yahweh has cast them aside ( ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫יכ‬
‫ל‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫ל־‬ ‫א‬ ַ , v. 9), abandoned them ( ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ַ  ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ַ , vv. 9
and 18a), and become distant ( ‫ק‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ל־‬ ‫א‬ ַ , v. 12). This abandonment is not death
as we define it (i.e., cessation of bodily functions) because it is precisely during
this period of divine absence that the supplicant fears their enemies will over-
take them (vv. 10–11). Viewed from the perspective of their own ancient Israel-
ite milieu, however, the supplicant was as good as dead, so that they describe
their restoration as nothing less than a kind of resurrection: “you will make me
live again and draw me up again out of the depths” (i.e., Sheol) (‫שׁוּב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫י‬ ִ‫ינ‬ ֵ‫יּ‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ְ
‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫שׁוּב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫הֹמוֹת‬ ‫תּ‬ ְ ‫;וּמ‬
v. 20). 3 The supplicant alternates between praise, la-
1
There are attestations of turning (‫שׁוּב‬ in the hiphil) the face toward (e.g., Dan 11:18) or away
from (e.g., Ezek 14:6) someone or something in BH, of course, but this idiom does not convey
the idea of divine abandonment or renewal of attention.

of Israel: The Ultimate Victory of the God of Life (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006), 35–66.336ment, and petition throughout the psalm but ends like our Akkadian prayer with
praise, though here it is much more extensive (vv. 22–24).

A Shuilla: Nergal 2
T ZVI A BUSCH
N ERGAL :
Nergal is a god of death and of war (as the one who inflicts death in war).
The name Nergal probably means, or at least was understood as, d nin-uru-gal-
(ak), “Lord of the great city (i.e., the netherworld).” The standard writing of the
name Nergal is d GÌR-eri 11 -gal (GÌR here is read by some as nè); this writing is
gradually replaced by d U . GUR . The writing u.gur has been interpreted by W. G.
Lambert as uqur, the imperative of naqāru, “to destroy.” 1 The name Nergal in our
text is written both as d U . GUR and as d GÌR-eri 11 -gal. Nergal’s main temple, É-mes-
lam, “house, warrior of the netherworld,” is in Cutha, where he is also called
Meslamtaʾea, “the one who comes forth from the Meslam.” His parentage is Nip-
purian: Enlil and Ninlil. He is associated with the planet Mars as well as with the
netherworld. (In the myth Nergal and Ereshkigal, he takes his place as its ruler
together with Ereshkigal.) Thus, he has a place both in heaven and in the neth-
erworld (see lines 5–8).

“Studies in Nergal,” BiOr 5/6 (1973), 356.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer to Nergal is an excellent example of a shuilla-prayer. It contains
the three expected sections: a hymnic introduction in which the god is invoked
and described (1–10); a supplication containing the self-presentation of the peti-
tioner, a description of his difficulty, his approach to the god, and his request
(11–23); and a promise of praise (24). The sections are clearly articulated and
coherent; they are thematically well-developed and have a formal shape. I limit
my comments here to the hymnic introduction and to lines 15–18 where the
speaker sets out the features of Nergal that have encouraged him to approach
the god.
Hymnic Introduction: The hymnic introduction is devoted to the descriptive
praise of Nergal. It contains three stanzas that are syntactically linked together.
They treat the god’s nature and place in a divine family (lines 1–4); his place in
339340the cosmos (lines 5–8); and his relationship to the world of humans and animals
(lines 9–10).
The first stanza treats two themes: the god’s nature as a warrior (a) and his
place in a divine family (b). Each line is made up of two half-lines; the lines
form couplets and the two couplets form a stanza. The two aforementioned
themes are integrated and laid out chiastically. Notice that the chiasm is re-
versed in the second couplet:
1.
a
b
×
2. bʹ aʹ
3. b ( )
×
4.
aʹ
bʹ
Note, however, that the composer deviated from the chiastic pattern in the sec-
ond part of line 3, where instead of presenting a feature of Nergal’s power
(theme a), he provides an epithet of Kutushar, Nergal’s mother, thus explicating
and expanding on the first half of the line.
The second stanza describes the god’s place in the cosmos. Here, again, the
composer follows a formal structure. Each couplet contains two parallel lines.
Yet, here, the form is different from that of lines 1–4, for lines 5–6 are each
made up of two independent (though obviously associated) clauses, whereas
both lines 7 and 8 form single clauses. Common themes and, even more, the
distribution of grammatical forms between lines and between couplets, draw
together each of the individual subsections and, then, the stanza as a whole.
That is, grammatically, line 5a parallels line 6a, and line 7a parallels line 8a;
moreover, whereas the first half-lines draw together each of the two subsections
(lines 5–6 and 7–8), the latter halves draw together the stanza as a whole, for
the corresponding half-lines 5b/7b and 6b/8b share syntactic forms:
5a. 2ms pred. + prep. (ina) + region
6a. 2ms pred. + prep. (ina) + region
7a. prep. (itti) DN(s) + prep. (ina) + region
8a. prep. (itti) DN(s) + prep. (ina) + region
5b. pred.+ subject with 2ms suffix
6b. object + prefixed verb (2ms)
7b. subject with 2ms suffix + pred.
8b. prefixed verb (2ms) + object
Whereas the parallel lines of each couplet have the same syntax and grammati-
cal word order in their first half, the latter halves of these lines correspond in
respect to their syntax not with each other, but rather with those of the other
couplet: 5b/7b, 6b/8b. Note, moreover, the chiastic arrangement of the gram-
matical forms in the corresponding lines of the two couplets (5b × 7b, 6b ×
8b). Thus, the first half-lines define and draw together the individual couplets,
and the final half-lines define and draw together the stanza as a whole.
The third stanza describes the god’s relationship to humans and animals,
thus bringing the god down to earth and serving as a prelude to the petitioner’s𒌋𒑆 A S HUILLA : N ERGAL 2
341
call upon the god in the next section. This stanza is made up of two clauses, each
of which extends over a whole poetic line. But in contrast to lines 7–8, the
clauses in lines 9–10 are connected by the enclitic –ma attached to iddikkā-ma of
line 9 and thus form a longer sentence.
Thus, lines 1–4 comprise a series of hemistichs where each half contrasts
with the other, lines 5–6 comprise a series of hemistichs where each half sup-
plements the other, lines 7–8 comprise full clauses, and finally lines 9–10 have
two full clauses that are connected with each other. The types of clauses form a
sequence that unify the hymn and move from an arena where the gods alone
exist to areas of concern to humans, from the poetic divine to the prosaic hu-
man, from the world of the divine alluded to by compact poetic images to the
world of the human depicted in drawn out prosaic descriptions.
Approach to the God: In lines 15–18 the speaker then points to the features
of Nergal that have encouraged him to approach the god. Before laying out the
structure and form of these lines, I should first note that against the majority of
witnesses, I follow Mayer’s MS B (K.2836+) in placing our line 17 before line 18
because muppalsāta of line 18 should, I think, lead directly into naplisannī-ma of
line 19. Contrary to this order, these lines are transposed in the other MSS and in
the main edition of Mayer. Lines 15, 16, 17, 18, as I number them in the present
treatment, parallel each other. More specifically, the opening hemistichs of lines
15–18 all contain: aššum + a predicative adjectival form which describes a per-
manent feature of the divine addresee + a 2ms subject pronominal suffix (gam-
malāta ‖ tayyārāta ‖ rēmēnêta ‖ muppalsāta). The second hemistichs of these lines
all contain verbs in the same grammatical form: 1cs perfect + either a 2ms ob-
ject pronominal suffix or an accusative noun + a 2ms possessive pronominal
suffix. The verbs in the opening halves of these lines seem to be synonymous. On
the other hand, the verbs in the latter halves seem to represent a meaningful
sequence or progression of movement towards the presence of the god: search-
ing for him, focusing upon him, standing before him, looking at him, all done in
preparation for making a request from him (lines 19–23).

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This is the superscript, marking the
beginning of the ritual wording. It is not part of the prayer. Bēlu, “lord.” Gašru, “very
strong, powerful.” Tizqāru, “exalted.” This adjective describes the god’s status (and not his
strength) and thus modifies the nomen regens of the following construct chain and not the
preceding noun. The pattern of this adjective is pitrāsu; our form is due to metathesis re-
sulting from the sibilant z: *zitqāru > tizqāru. Bukru, “son.” In Akkadian, in contrast to
biblical Hebrew, bukru is not limited to the firstborn. d Nunamnir, the father of Nergal, is
here a name of Enlil. The name reflects that god’s authority: Nu(n)-nam-nir, “prince of
sovereignty” or “the one of sovereignty.”
šiptu: bēlu gašru tizqāru bukur Nunamnir
Line 2: In this line the composer brings together Nergal’s roles as ruling god of the
netherword and as god of war. Ašarēdu, “foremost.” The Anunnakki here refer to the gods
of the netherworld. EN = bēlu, see line 1. Tamḫāru, “battle, combat.”
ašarēd Anunnakkī bēl tamḫāri
Line 3: Ilittu, “offspring.” d Kutušar, a mother goddess, the mother of Nergal; here, it is
probably a name of Ninlil. The name reflects that goddess’s function as a mother goddess
(see the Sumerian myth Enlil and Ninlil, where Ninlil gives birth to Nanna, Nergal, Ninazu,
and Enbilulu). Šarratu, “queen.” Rabû (m), rabītu (f), “great.”
ilitti Kutušar šarrati rabīti
Line 4: Kaškaššu, “all powerful.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Narāmu, “beloved.” The
goddess Ninmena here is the wife of Nergal, though she appears elsewhere as his mother.
Nergal kaškaš ilī narām Ninmenna
Line 5: Šūpâta is a 2ms predicative of šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to be(come) manifest, bril-
liant.” Ina, “in.” Šamû, “heavens.” KÙ . MEŠ = ellūtu, “pure.” Šaqû, “to be(come) elevated.”
Šaqu is the 3ms predicative form. Manzāzu (mazzāzu), lit. “position, place of standing.”
Here the word has the astral meaning “station, position” in the heavens, referring to Mars.
Ina šamê ellūti (line 5) and ina arallî (line 6) are syntactically part of the first half of each
line, but also apply to the second half.

Line 6: Rabû, “to be big, great.” Rabâta is the 2ms predicative form. É . KUR . ÚŠ = aral-
lû, a name of the netherworld. Māḫiru, “rival, opponent.” Lā, “not.” Išû, “to have.”
rabâta ina arallî māḫira lā tīšu
Line 7: Itti, “with.” Ea is god of wisdom, water, and magic (see page 227). UKKIN =
puḫru, “assembly.” Milku, “counsel, advice.” Šūtur is a 3ms predicative of šūturu (Š of
[w]atāru), “to be preeminent.” In line 7, LKA 30 and PBS 1/2 119 (Mayer’s MSS F and G
from Ashur and Babylonia, respectively) read d A-ni 7 . In line 8, PBS 1/2 119 adds u KI -tì,
thus reading šamê u erṣeti. If we follow the main text of lines 7–8, then we have a chiastic
arrangement a-b-bʹ-aʹ in lines 5–8: a. heaven (line 5); b. institution, i.e., netherworld (line
6); bʹ. institution, i.e., council (line 7); aʹ. heaven (line 8). But the pattern in the variant
texts (especially šamê u erṣeti in line 8) seems to be different.
itti Ea ina puḫur ilī milikka šūtur
Line 8: d 30 = Sîn, the moon god (see page 385). Šeʾû, “to observe.” The form is a G
2ms durative. Gimru, “totality, everything.”
itti Sîn ina šamê tašeʾʾi gimri
Line 9: Nadānu, “to give.” The signs id-din-ka present a morphographemic writing.
The final radical of the root assimilates into the initial consonant of the 2ms pronominal
suffix, thus id-din-ka is transcribed iddikka. d EN . LÍL = Ellil, the father of Nergal. Abu, “fa-
ther.” Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” refers to mankind. Napištu, “life.”
iddikkā-ma Ellil abūka ṣalmāt qaqqadi puḫur napišti
Line 10: Būlu, “animals, livestock.” Šakkan was the divine protector of wild animals.
Nammaššû (nammaštû), “wild animals.” Qātu, “hand.” Qātukka is the noun qātu with the
locative-adverbial ending (–um) plus a 2ms possessive suffix. Here, however, the locative
ending has a terminative meaning, ana, “to(ward).” The m of the ending assimilates to the
k of the 2ms pronominal suffix. Paqādu, “to entrust, to care for, to appoint.”

Line 11: Anāku, “I.” NENNI = annanna, “so-and-so.” A = māru, “son.” ÌR = ardu (war-
dum), “servant.” In place of the generic formula, “I (am) so-and-so, the son of so-and-so,
your servant,” of line 11, two MSS (Mayer’s MSS B and G) add different expanded versions

B adds the so-called attalû (“eclipse”) formula to the self-presentation formula, which
names Ashurbanipal (see Mayer, UFBG, 100–102 for a brief discussion). MS G attests a
longer self-presentation, naming Shamash-shum-ukin, adds the attalû formula but without
the line mentioning the eclipse (see UFBG, 101, n.65), and also includes a sterotypical
lament and petition for the removal of the evil (UFBG, 73–75 and 265–69).

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In 2 Kgs 17:24 the people of Cutha are said to have been settled in Samaria
subsequent to the conquest and deportation of northern Israel, and in v. 30 the
people of Cutha are described as worshipping Nergal. In Jer 39:3, 13 Nergal
appears in the PN ‫ר‬ ‫צ‬ ֶ ‫ר־א‬
‫שׂ‬ ַ ‫ל‬ ‫ג‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ְ ֵ‫נ‬ , Nergal-sar-ezer, an official of the Babylonian king
(for the name, see HALOT, 723b). Nergal is identified with the western Resheph
(see Wiggermann, 216, 218, 222), a god of battle, death, and disease, who is
armed with bow and arrow. Resheph appears in demonic form in the Hebrew
Bible as the personification of pestilence (see Deut 32:24, Hab 3:5, and Job 5:7).
For points of specific interest in the Hebrew Bible and later Hebrew, I note
the following: With arallû (line 6) compare ‫ל‬ ‫יא‬
‫ר‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֲ / ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ַ in Ezek 43:15, which
Albright thought was a loan word from arallû (see HALOT, 87b). With Enlil’s
placing of animals under the control of Nergal (lines 9–10) compare Ps 8:7–9,
especially v. 8. For ṣītu u ḫuluqqu (line 13), “expenses and losses,” compare later
Hebrew ‫ואבדות‬ ‫הוצאות‬ , as well as Aramaic ‫נפקתא‬ and ‫אבדתא‬. With the descrip-
tions of the deity in the first hemistichs in lines 15–18, gammalāta, tayyārāta,
rēmēnêta, muppalsāta, compare respectively Hebrew ‫נוּן‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫גמל‬, ‫שׁוב‬/‫סלח‬, ‫חוּם‬ ‫ר‬, ָ and
‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ַ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫יר‬ ‫א‬ ִ ‫מ‬.

A Shuilla: Nisaba 1
C HRISTOPHER F RECHETTE
N ISABA :
In the Mesopotamian pantheon, Nisaba was the goddess of grain and of the
scribal arts and was accorded familial associations with several major gods. The
Sumerogram d NISABA can signify either this goddess’s name or a general term for
grain. Nisaba was considered the oldest child of Enlil and a daughter of Urash,
ancestor of Anu. In first millennium texts, she was considered a daughter of Anu
or Ea, and therefore an aunt or sister of Marduk. In the Ur III and OB periods,
her spouse was Ḫaya, but in the first millennium Nabu was considered her
spouse, apparently because of their shared association with the scribal arts. 1 In
the OB period, Nabu and Nisaba are attested as personal gods of scribes. 2 A tab-
let found at the site of the Temple of Nabu at Nimrud (CTN IV, no. 168) and
identified by a note on its left edge as “shuillas of great and exalted goddesses”
contains seven prayers with ritual instructions to four goddesses (Nisaba, Ishtar,
Tashmetu, and Nanaya), their common characteristic being a spousal or love
relationship to Nabu. 3 The first two prayers on the tablet are to Nisaba, the first
of which is the present prayer.
The cult of Nisaba, about which there is little information, dates as early as
the ED period and seems to have been limited primarily to Nippur, where she
was worshipped at the temple of her daughter Ninlil; no temples dedicated to
her are yet attested. 4 Despite the fact that her status seems to have waned by the

While Nabu was considered a spouse of Nisaba in the late period, Nabu’s more long-standing
consorts were initially Tashmetu and later Nanaya (see Francesco Pomponio, “Nabû. A. Philolo-
gisch,” RlA 9 [1998–2001], 16–24). Nanaya, the goddess of erotic love and the mistress of Nabu,
belonged to the circle of Ishtar, with whom she was at some points syncretized (Marten Stol,
“Nanaja,” RlA 9 [1998–2001], 146–51). In Nabu’s home city of Borsippa, both Nanaya and
Tashmetu were identified as “queens of Borsippa” (Paul-Alain Beaulieu, The Pantheon of Uruk
During the Neo-Babylonian Period [Cuneiform Monographs 23; Leiden/Boston: Brill/Styx, 2003],

351352OB period, her association with writing and grain remained. As with Nabu, a
stylus served as her emblem. 5 At present, while no iconographic depiction of
Nisaba can be identified with certainty, it is possible that among representations
of deities associated with vegetation, e.g., anthropomorphic figures with branch-
es above their shoulders or in their hands, some may depict her. 6
Nisaba was not included among the elite of the Mesopotamian pantheon.
Nevertheless, combined with her familial relationships to Ea, Enlil, and Nabu,
the associations of Nisaba with grain and with the scribal arts suggest that she
was regarded as wielding significant influence among the gods. Indeed, her abil-
ity to influence other deities is central to the present prayer. For, as do many
Akkadian shuilla-prayers of the āšipu, this prayer asks a deity to intercede with
other deities, specifically the client’s personal god and goddess, in order to gain
forgiveness and reconciliation. Grain was the most important food for people in
Mesopotamian society, and consequently it was the most important type of offer-
ing in Mesopotamian rituals. 7 Moreover, feeding a deity was understood to ren-
der him or her receptive to petition. Since the gods were believed to rely on food
offerings, and since grain was the most important of these, the grain used to
pacify the gods through offerings ritually manifested her influential capacity.
Her association with the scribal arts linked her influence to the enactment of this
ritual prayer. Vital throughout Mesopotamian culture, the scribal arts held par-
ticular importance for ritual experts. Written records allowed these scholars to
preserve for their use the sacred traditions of the very ritual prayers and actions
employed to engage the gods properly in order to gain their favor.
T HE P RAYER :
Nisaba 1 provides a window into the multi-faceted rationale by which ele-
ments of ritual functioned in first-millennium Mesopotamian religion. Based on
its language, literary form, classifying rubric, and inclusion within the craft of
the āšipu, this ritual-prayer may be classified as an Akkadian shuilla. 8 Typical of
such ritual-prayers, it functioned in part to gain the intercession of Nisaba in
reconciling personal gods and speaker. However, the instructions describing the
context of its recitation indicate that it functioned also to prepare a material for
use in ritual activity, a function atypical of Akkadian shuillas but found in a
number of incantations which modern scholars have called Kultmittelbeschwör-
ungen (see page 29). Blending both functions this ritual-prayer manifests the
powerful influence of Nisaba for reconciling individuals with their angry deities.

As explained in the general introduction, in this book the term “shuilla” refers to the ritual
prayer as a whole, including the recited text and associated ritual activity; the term “shuilla-
prayer” refers specifically to the text of the prayer.

Its four known exemplars and two texts preserving its incipit, all date to the first
millennium and come from diverse locations, including Nineveh, Sippar, and
Kalḫu. 9
The first part of the classifying rubric appended to this prayer fits the typi-
cal form for this class of shuilla-prayer: “wording of a ‘lifted-hand’ to DN” (ka-
inim-ma šu-íl-la (2) d DN-ke 4 ). The term “lifted-hand” in this context likely refers to
the composite ritual activity of spoken words and attendant actions among
which a gesture of hand-lifting was likely assumed by the ritual specialist (see
discussion in the introduction, p. 35). While most such classifying rubrics con-
clude with the name of the deity, both of the exemplars of this prayer that are
not broken away after the name of the goddess continue by clarifying that it is
“for turning away divine anger” (dingir-šà-dib-ba gur-ru-da-kám). This Sumerian
phrase identifies a class of ritual-prayers of the āšipu that are typically addressed
to the personal deities whose anger is at issue (see the discussion in the intro-
duction, page 40). 10 The present prayer, like the other Akkadian shuilla-prayers,
is not directed to a personal deity but to one of the “high gods,” and like many
of them asks Nisaba to intercede with the speaker’s angry personal gods. Since
Akkadian shuillas commonly declare the petitioner’s desire to be reconciled with
angry deities, the rubric’s inclusion of the words “for turning away divine anger”
may be interpreted as emphasizing or further specifying the purpose of this par-
ticular shuilla-prayer. Such additional identifying rubrics, while rare, are attest-
ed among Akkadian shuillas. (See page 29 in the introduction.)
Like other shuilla-prayers, which range from twenty to thirty lines in length,
Nisaba 1 includes several standard elements in typical sequence but is relatively
short. Four lines of address characterize the deity (lines 1–4), three lines of peti-
tion seek her intercession to reconcile personal deities with the client (lines 5–
7), and three lines seek forgiveness of the client’s sins (lines 14–16). The prayer
concludes with a single line offering to praise the goddess (line 17).
One exemplar, our MS A, which is in NB script and was apparently written
for a specific occasion, includes an insertion of several formulaic elements after
the section seeking reconciliation: an identification of the speaker as Shamash-
shum-ukin (lines 8–9), 11 a complaint concerning omens portending evil fates

Since a new edition of this prayer is in press and not yet available at the time of writing, a
summary of the textual witnesses is in order. The four exemplars of this prayer are MS A = BM
78219; MS B = K.6028; MS C = K.3392; MS D = ND 5493 = IM 67630. Two texts preserve only
the incipit: MS E = BM 122647 and MS F = K.2798+. In the current transliteration and transla-
tion, lines 1–13 follow MS A; line 14 completes MS C with MS D; line 15 follows MS D; lines 16–17
follow MS C; and lines 18–19 complete MS C with MS D.

Shamash-shum-ukin, whose name means “Shamash has firmly established a name” (Akk.
Šamaš-šum-ukīn), reigned as king of Babylon from 667–648 BCE . He was a son of Esarhaddon and
older brother of Ashurbanipal and succeeded to the throne of Babylon after the death of their
father in 669 BCE . Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria from 668–c.630 BCE , began fighting to supplant
Shamash-shum-ukin in 652 BCE ; the latter died (or was killed) in 648 BCE . See Grant Frame,
“Šamaš-šuma-ukīn,” RlA 11 (2008), 618–21.354(lines 10–11), and a petition for protection from those fates (lines 12–13). Based
on this exemplar alone, the end of which is broken, we cannot know the precise
ritual context of that occasion. However, considerable evidence indicates that
shuilla-rituals were sometimes carried out in conjunction with namburbi-rituals,
whose explicit purpose was to dissolve the calamitous fate portended by an
omen (see the introduction, page 36). Such may have been the case for this ex-
emplar.
The complaint in lines 10–11 is a variation on a formulaic expression of con-
cern over unfavorable omens. 12 Such a complaint is usually followed by one or
more statements in which the speaker expresses fear, turns to the deity, requests
the deity’s attention, or petitions for help. In MS A, however, such a statement is
absent. Consequently, the element of complaint takes the form of a lengthy
prepositional phrase that is grammatically subordinate to the petition:
ina lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ
lumuššina ayyâši u ekallīya
ayy-iṭḫâm ayy-isniq ayy-iqrib ayy-ikšudanni
Concerning (ina) [the evil omens]
That occurred in my palace and my land,
May their evil towards me and my palace
Not approach, not come near,
not come close, not reach me!
This sentence is comprehensible, but awkward. An exemplar of the prayer Ner-
gal 2 contains a nearly identical insertion which also names Shamash-shum-
ukin, but that exemplar adds a line to the complaint-element. 13 As a result, the
complaint is no longer couched in a subordinate prepositional phrase, but forms
a complete sentence expressing the king’s anxiety:
ina lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ
palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku
lumuššina ayyâši u ekallīya
ayy-iṭḫâm ayy-isniq ayy-iqrib ayy-ikšudanni
As a result of (ina) [the evil omens]
That occurred in my palace and my land,
I am afraid, anxious, and panicked.
May their evil towards me and my palace
Not approach, not come near,
not come close, not reach me!
12
While Werner Mayer includes this complaint formula among exemplars of the so-called “attalû
formula” concerning a lunar eclipse that portends evil for the king’s palace and land, the present
insertion lacks the formula’s first line, which mentions the eclipse (UFBG, 100–102). Of the
twenty-eight occurrences of this formula noted by Mayer, twenty-four occur in shuilla-prayers;
occurrences in the present insertion and in one exemplar of Nergal 2 are the only two in which
the first line, which mentions the eclipse, does not occur. (For a list of all exemplars of this for-
mula see UFBG, 100, n. 64. For a transliteration of the insertion in this exemplar of Nergal 2, see
UFBG, 480, Text G, lines 12ʹ–18ʹ and page 344 in this book.) Moreover, Mayer describes another
complaint formula that is strikingly similar to the attalû formula, but it lacks the line concerning
the eclipse altogether and refers to evil that threatens the ordinary person’s house and person,
not the king’s palace (Formula α, UFBG, 102–3). The self-identification formula, which may or
may not immediately precede either of these two complaint formulas, may function either as a
subject for what follows or as an independent clause (see UFBG, 46–52).

See the previous footnote.𒌋𒌋 A S HUILLA : N ISABA 1
355
The insertion as it appears in Nergal 2 avoids the dubious syntax of Nisaba 1 and
clarifies the logical connection between the king’s predicament and his petition.
Moreover, this additional line, palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, constitutes a stock
phrase found in parallel formulas in many Akkadian shuilla-prayers and so was
arguably omitted by mistake. Consequently, it makes sense to restore this line.
In most cases, an Akkadian shuilla would have been carried out “in front of”
(ina/ana maḫar) a deity manifest either in its astral form or in the form of a cult
image or standard. 14 The three exemplars of the full text of Nisaba 1 for which
the end of the prayer is preserved all include the same brief ritual instruction:
the prayer is to be recited not to the deity by name but to a certain type of inex-
pensive flour (maṣḫatu) used almost exclusively for ritual offerings. 15 This flour,
then, was presumably identified as a manifestation of the goddess Nisaba.
The ritual instructions on the preserved exemplars of Nisaba 1 only indicate
recitation of the prayer to the flour. As in any written ritual instruction from
Mesopotamia, however, one ought not to presume that ritual actions were lim-
ited to what is written. Indeed, flour as a ritual offering was typically scattered
(sarāqu) either upon a censer or the animal offering and could be mixed with
other ingredients such as water or oil before being poured. 16 A similar but more
detailed instruction for the recitation of this prayer in the ritual tablet for the
elaborate Bīt salāʾ mê (“house of water-sprinkling”) royal ritual confirms such a
usage. 17 The ritual instructions call first for setting up an altar and for making an
offering in front of maṣḫatu-flour and then for the recitation of Nisaba 1. After
the making of an offering to the planet Jupiter (which is identified with Mar-
duk), the same maṣḫatu-flour is poured out or scattered, presumably as part of
the offering to Jupiter/Marduk.
As mentioned above, although Nisaba 1 is addressed to maṣḫatu-flour, nei-
ther the prayer nor its ritual activity fits neatly with what is typical of
Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Rather, evidence for the ritual context of Nisaba 1 in Bīt
14
Ritual instructions appended to copies of shuilla-prayers vary greatly in the degree of detail
given and in many cases do not identify the deity before whom the prayer is recited or the offer-
ing set up. However, when the recipient of an offering or prayer is indicated, it is typically a
name for the deity addressed in the prayer. Some Mesopotamian deities have more than one
name. For instance, the god Ea may also be referred to as Enlilbanda (see page 227).

Bīt salāʾ mê was carried out from the fourth to the eight of Tashritu during the fall New Year’s
festival in Babylon. Claus Ambos, “Das ‘Neujahrs’-Fest zur Jahresmitte und die Investitur des

in this ritual, see Frechette and Hrůša.356salāʾ mê, strengthened by its likely similar context in an additional royal ritual, 18
illuminates the way in which this prayer blended functionality typical of Akka-
dian shuilla-prayers with that of Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Nisaba’s presumed
influence over other gods is manifested in both respects. Like the
Kultmittelbeschwörungen, which included descriptions of the special qualities of
the objects addressed, 19 Nisaba 1 is directed to a material that is then manipu-
lated in a ritual. However, the words addressed to the maṣḫatu-flour do not de-
scribe its material qualities but rather name anthropomorphic characteristics of
the goddess, as do many shuilla-prayers; she is “merciful,” she “creates god,
king, and human,” she “reconciles angry gods to humans.” 20
The image of Nisaba as a “net” (saparru, line 3) capable of making angry de-
ities relent captures well the influence of this deity. A saparru is attested as being
spread out or thrown in order to capture and pacify an opposing deity. This im-
age provides a link between the anthropomorphic images of Nisaba and the ma-
terial manifestation of the goddess as flour, which, like such a net, is cast to-
wards the deity. The recital of Nisaba 1 in conjunction with ritual scattering of
maṣḫatu-flour as an offering would have manifested influence to calm angry dei-
ties. In Bīt salāʾ mê this ritual-prayer would have rendered Jupiter/Marduk,
widely attested as a furious warrior, calm and amenable to interceding for the
king in order to reconcile him with his personal gods. It begins there a lengthy
sequence of shuillas to the gods of Nippur and Babylon that continues through
the night intended to gain also their intercession on the king’s behalf. It is possi-
ble that at least some of the offerings in the subsequent lengthy sequence of
shuilla-rituals in Bīt salāʾ mê might also have included maṣḫatu-flour and, if so,
would have further manifested Nisaba’s influence.
18
Noting that the colophon to MS C identifies it with the royal ritual complex Bīt rimki, Cecil
Mullo-Weir argued that Nisaba 1 may be restored as initiating the lengthy sequence of shuillas in
one version of that complex (BBR 26+), where, as in Bīt salāʾ mê, it is followed immediately by a
shuilla to Marduk (“The Prayer Cycle in the Assyrian Ritual bît rimki, Tablet IV,” AfO 18 [1957–
1958], 371–72).

20
Moreover, in Bīt salāʾ mê, Nisaba 1 differs from the sequence of ten Kultmittelbeschwörungen
which immediately precede it in that none of them include instructions for the making of an
offering to the materials to which they are addressed. Yet, an offering is made to the maṣḫatu-
flour in conjunction with the recitation of Nisaba 1.

Line 1: ÉN in many cases marks the beginning of wording to be recited in rituals;
while it is often equated by scholars with šiptu, “incantation,” it is not clear that the scribes
read the word as Akkadian. They may have simply understood it as a Sumerian word. In
any case, it is not part of the prayer itself. d NISABA ( d ŠE . NAGA ; also read d NIDABA ) can signify
either a general term for grain or the goddess Nisaba. The NAGA sign originally depicted a
plant, possibly barley, and the ŠE sign may have originally represented a spike of grain.
Šarratu, “queen.” Ḫumālu is a rare term of uncertain meaning. Neither the CAD (Ḫ, 234)
nor Seux (339) offers a translation. Wolfram von Soden has suggested that behind this
term stands the Heb. (Canaanite) ‫ל‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫ח‬,
“to have compassion” (“Bemerkungen zu einigen
literarischen Texten in akkadischer Sprache aus Ugarit,” UF 1 [1969], 191). This view is
reflected in AHw, which glosses ḫumalīti as “freundliche”? (355a) but offers a correction,
glossing ḫumālu as “Mitleid [compassion]”? (1562a). The CDA reflects both possibilities,
glossing ḫumalīti as “friendly, sympathetic”? (120). Following Hrůša’s edition, the present
form is here taken as a denominative adjective (“merciful”) in a form referred to as “nisbe”
(the term is borrowed from Arabic grammar), in which -ī is added to the base of the noun
(see Huehnergard, §6.2; GAG, §56 q). The case vowel is i, rather than the expected u of the
nominative, but case endings in texts from the late period are often arbitrary.
šiptu: Nisaba šarratu ḫumalīti
Line 2: While DÙ may indicate either banû or epēšu, context here suggests the former.
Banû, “to create.” The form is a fs participle in construct with the following three terms
(all gen.). DINGIR = ilu, “god.” LUGAL = šarru, “king.” NAM . LÚ . U 18 . LU = amīlūtu (awīlūtum),
“mankind, humanity.”
bānât ili šarri u amīlūti
Line 3: Saparru, “net, throw-net.” This term is attested as a kind of (divine) weapon
which was “spread out” (šuparruru or tarāṣu) in order to capture and pacify a raging hos-
tile deity (see CAD S, 161; CAD Š/3, 317–18). Such use of a saparru is attributed to Nisaba,
e.g., saparru ša Nisaba liksûšu, “May Nisaba’s net ensnare him” (cited by CAD S, 161).
Hammurabi also describes himself as sapar nakirī “enemy-ensnaring throw-net” (Laws of
Hammurabi ii 68; Martha Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor [2d ed.;
SBLWAW 6; Scholars Press: Atlanta, 1997], 78). Depicting Nisaba as a net for constraining
an opponent provides a significant link between words and ritual action. It not only corre-
sponds with the request in the present prayer that Nisaba pacify the speaker’s angry per-
sonal deities, it also mirrors the ritual activity of pouring or sprinkling of flour as a ritual
offering. The last two words in the line form a phrase in apposition to Anunnakkī. Anun-
nakkū is often left untranslated. In earlier Sum. texts the term referred to the gods, espe-358d

Line 4: Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to bring about peace, reconciliation; to cause to re-
lent.” This participle is in construct with the following four words, all of which are in the
gen. Zenû (ms), zenītu (fs), “angry.” While one would not ordinarily expect a construct
chain to be interrupted by adjectives, this rule is sometimes violated. MS A ze-na-a, MS D
ze-ne-e: the case vowel â in MS A is an apparently erroneous accusative case; the case vow-
el ê in MS D reflects the Assyrian genitive ending –e (rather than the Babylonian –i). Ištaru,
“goddess.” While the Sumerogram d 15 may indicate the name of the goddess Ishtar, the
name of this divinity also became a general appellative for “goddess,” as in the typical
phrase “god and goddess.” Ze-ni-t[u 4 ]: Only MS A preserves the ending here, which errone-
ously indicates the case vowel u rather than the expected i.
musallimat ila zenâ ištara zenītu
Line 5: Šapāru, “to send.” The form is a 1cs precative with a 2fs pronominal suffix. Af-
ter the preposition ana the nouns and adjectives are all in the genitive; both nouns have
pronominal suffixes 1cs (indicated by MU ). Having described pertinent characteristics of
Nisaba in lines 1–4, the speaker now begins the petition using language echoing that de-
scription.
lušpurki ana ilīya zenî ištarīya zenīti
Line 6: Ša introduces a relative clause. While one might take the following two forms,
as well as zenû to be adjectives, they are more likely predicative constructions (statives)
with the subordination (or subjunctive) marker –u. Kamālu, “to be(come) angry, wrathful.”
Šabāsu, “to be angry, furious.” Libbu, “heart.” The –ma here, which occurs in only one of
the two preserved MSS , may serve as a conjunction or have an emphatic or topicalizing
function (see GAG §123a). Zenû, “to be angry.” KI = itti, “with.” KI . MU = ittīya, “with me.”
While these predicative constructions are single in agreement with the subject libbu, the
translation should reflect plurality: “whose hearts are wrathful, furious and angry.”
ša kamlu šabsu libbašunū-ma zenû ittīya
Line 7: Sullumu, see line 4. Sullimī is a D fs impv. plus ventive. The –ma is emphatic.
Of the four MSS preserving DINGIR here, only MS A adds MEŠ , and this need not indicate a
plural. Assyriologists generally recognize that in some nominal forms MEŠ has become a
frozen form; thus, Borger notes that in nominal forms, MEŠ may be meaningless (MZL, no.
754, 420). Since u may serve as the case vowel for the accusative as well as the nomina-
tive in SB, and seeing that of the four terms requiring an accusative ending in this line,𒌋𒌋 A S HUILLA : N ISABA 1

sion under T HE P RAYER . Self-presentation formulas, such as that in lines 8–9, may function
as an independent clause or as a subject for what follows (see Mayer, UFBG, 46–52).

Line 9: Ša introduces a relative clause. Marduk (= d AMAR . UTU ), the ruling god of Bab-
ylon, and his spouse Zarpanitu are here named as the personal god and goddess of Sha-
mash-shum-ukin, the Babylonian king.
ša ilšu Marduk ištaršu Zarpānītu
Line 10: Ina, “as a result of.” ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, misfortune, calamity.” Á . MEŠ = idāti
and GISKIM . MEŠ = ittāti are often taken as alternate gen. fp forms of ittu, “omen, ominous
sign.” However, the two terms, although identical in semantic range, represent two differ-
ent bases itta- and idat- (see CAD I/J, 309–10). For a detailed linguistic and conceptual
treatment of ittu as Omenanzeiger [omen-announcer] and idātu as “die (fein)materiell
gedachte ‘Abstrahlung’ des Omenanzeigers [the (subtly) tangible ‘radiation’ of the omen-
announcer],” see Maul, ZB, 6–7. ḪUL = lemnu, “inauspicious, ill-boding, dangerous.” NU =
lā, “not.” DÙG . GA = ṭābu, “auspicious, favorable.” The syntax of this line is clear, but its
meaning depends on one’s understanding of how omens operated. Lumun is in construct
with idāti and ittāti, and the adjectives lemnēti lā ṭābāti may be taken to modify ittāti or both
idāti and ittāti. Stefan Maul takes both the adjectives in this phrase, which occurs frequent-
ly in namburbis, as modifying both nouns: “Die bösen, unguten idātu und ittātu [The evil,
no-good idātu and ittātu]” (ZB, 6 n.41). Seux’s translation of the line inserts an implied
verb and a relative pronoun: “[Quant au mal] (qu’annoncent) les signes et les présages
mauvais, défavorables” (340). Thus, Seux takes the construct chain lumun idāti ittāti to
imply, “the evil that the signs and evil, unfavorable portents announce.” Mayer also as-
sumes that signs and portents announce evil, but his translation does not represent the
Akkadian syntax literally, taking lemnēti lā ṭābāti as what is being announced: “bei/wegen
dem Übel von Vorzeichen und Anzeichen, die Schlechtes und Unheil (verkünden) [because
of the evil of the signs and portents, (which announce) something bad and disaster]”
(UFBG, 103). While Seux and Mayer agree that in the Mesopotamian worldview omens
announce events, Maul clarifies that omens there “announce” not only by indicating a por-
tended event, but by activating it in a concrete way (ZB, 5).

Line 11: Ša introduces a relative clause whose antecedent is idāti ittāti. É . GAL = ekallu,
“palace.” KUR = mātu, “land.” GÁL . MEŠ = bašû, “to occur.” While the MEŠ sign in verbal
logograms can signify the plural or an iterative stem (Borger, MZL, no. 754, 420), the pre-
sent normalization is based on the syllabic spelling ib-šá-a-ma in the parallel formula in
Nergal 2 discussed in the introduction to the prayer (see Mayer, UFBG, 480, Text G: 15′).
The text following the line is restored after a formula occurring in that same parallel text
(see discussion under T HE P RAYER ). Palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am anxious (palāḫu), I
am afraid (adāru), and I am panicked (Št adāru).” All three forms are 1cs predicative con-
structions (statives). For this formulary, see also Mayer, UFBG, 73.
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ / 〈palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku〉
Line 12: The pronominal suffix on lumnu, BI = –šina, refers back to idāti ittāti. Note
that the n of the noun assimilates to the š of the suffix. Ayyâši, “towards me,” is a form of
the 1cs dative pronoun to which the preposition ana has assimilated (ayyâši < ana yâši, cf.
GAG, §41 j 2). IA-ši is taken here as ayyâši since the É . G [ AL -ia] which follows it demands
the preposition ana (see Mayer, UFBG, 267). For the possibility of reading IA as ay(y)V, see
Werner Mayer, “Besonderheiten in der Verwendung des Graphems A . A im Akkadischen,”
Or n.s. 72 (2003), 293–306, at 305–6. While the translation given below may be read am-
biguously, it is important to recognize that the prepositional phrase, “towards me and my
palace,” modifies the series of verbs in the following line, not the subject, “their evil.”
lumuššina ayyâši u ekallīya
Line 13: TE = ṭeḫû, “to come near to, to approach.” DIM 4 = sanāqu, “to check, to ap-
proach, to come near.” KU . NU = qerēbu, “to approach, to come close to.” KUR = kašādu, “to
reach, to arrive, to conquer.” All of these verbs are vetitives (prefix ayy– plus the preter-
ite), that is, negative commands.
ayy-iṭḫâm ayy-isniq ayy-iqrib ayy-ikšudanni

(N stem of paṭāru, for which see line 15). Gillatu, “sin, sacrilege, crime, misdeed.” In view

Line 16: Paṭāru is a G inf. here, meaning “releasing” (thus, “absolution”). It is bound
to the following noun, eʾiltīya. These two words form a genitive (construct) chain, which is
the object of the following verb. Naqbû (N of qabû), “to be spoken, commanded.” In pray-
ers, the request that the deity “speak” or “command” what the speaker desires reflects the
view that the divine word was effective for determining events (see Mayer, UFBG, 297–
306). The remainder of this line is not well preserved in any of the textual witnesses. The
reading šumu (= MU ), “name, repute, fame,” is possible but uncertain because of missing
context. The presence of šumka could indicate that the second half of this line begins the
typical element of the promise of praise. While šumu is not well attested in typical phrases
in the context of a “promise to praise,” Mayer identifies the expression šuma ullulu in this
context, interpreting it, “to let the name shine brightly” (UFBG, 340).

Line 17: Narbû, “great deeds,” pl. of narbû “greatness.” This form may be read as sin-
gular or plural. Regarding its occurrence in the context of the “promise to praise” in pray-
ers, while CAD interprets it as the singular “greatness” (CAD N/1, 351), both Mayer
(UFBG, 320) and Maul (ZB, 418/420, line 20) take it as a plural meaning “great deeds.” MS

prayer was recited.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In light of the function of this ritual-prayer to Nisaba, who is manifested
both mythically as an influential goddess who makes angry deities relent and
concretely in the maṣḫatu-flour employed within the ritual, I begin these com-
parative suggestions with a discussion of grain and grain offerings in the Bible.
In the agrarian societies of the ancient Near East, grain was the fundamental
building block of the economy and the main medium of taxation. 1 In Mesopota-
mia, grain was the most important among human foods and among ritual food
offerings for the gods; it was offered in the form of bread, cereal products, por-
ridge, and flour. 2 As flour, it was typically scattered (sarāqu) either upon a cen-
ser or upon the burnt animal offering and could be mixed with other ingredients
such as water or oil before being poured. 3 Among libations, beer made from bar-
ley or emmer-wheat was very common.
While the Mesopotamians identified grain with Nisaba, the Bible depicts
Yahweh as responsible for providing it. Deuteronomy identifies abundance of
grain as among the blessings assured by Yahweh in response to covenant loyalty
(Deut 7:13) and the lack of grain resulting in the people’s destruction as among
the curses for covenant infidelity (Deut 28:51). Psalm 65:9–13 offers a lyric de-
scription of the Israelite god’s intimate involvement in bringing forth an abun-
dant harvest of grain. The Bible also portrays grain as an offering given to the
deity. In the Priestly material of the Pentateuch, the term ‫ה‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ְ‫נ‬ ‫מ‬ ִ , which otherwise
in BH may simply signify “gift,” specifies “cereal offering.” 4 Leviticus 2:1–16 and
6:7–11 describe an array of cereal offerings, all of which combine fine flour
(‫ת‬ ‫ֹל‬ ֶ ‫ס‬ ) and oil but contain no leaven; they may take the shape of unleavened
cakes or wafers and may be baked or cooked on a griddle or in a pan. A portion
of each is “turned into smoke” (hiphil of ‫)קטר‬ with frankincense as an offering to
Yahweh, and the remainder of each is then given to the priests. Thus, in the
Priestly material as in Mesopotamia, and in particular as we may understand
offerings accompanying Nisaba 1, various forms of food made from flour were
offered ritually by burning. While the Priestly material specifies cooking or bak-
ing of these foods prior to offering them, the Mesopotamian sources allow for
offering flour, perhaps mixed with oil or water, directly.

The explicit purpose of Nisaba 1 in conjunction with grain offerings as an
appeal for help in calming angry gods finds only indirect parallels in the story of
Noah and in the sacrificial system of the Priestly writings.
In the Priestly system, if sacrifices and offerings to Yahweh can be said to
have a pacifying function, it is with an emphasis on their capacity to please the
deity rather than on the necessity of calming divine anger. Many biblical narra-
tives and prayers acknowledge Yahweh’s anger, but the use of offerings to calm
this anger is not addressed in the Priestly sacrificial system. While sinful acts
may have been presumed to anger the deity, sin offerings are not explicitly
characterized as calming divine anger.
More specifically, one view of Leviticus 1–3 supports the possibility that the
grain offerings described in Leviticus 2 might have been applied in a variety of
situations, including times of distress which could well have been attributed to
divine anger. In both Mesopotamian and biblical sources, cereal offerings are
inexpensive, and even the poorest worshipers can make them. Prayers to Sha-
mash and Marduk specify maṣḫatu flour as what the widow offers to the god. 5
Baruch Schwartz considers that Leviticus 1–3 is a unified divine speech pertain-
ing to gift offerings (‫ה‬ ‫שּׁ‬ ֶ ‫)א‬,
which are distinct from expiatory offerings in that
they allowed the worshiper to offer Yahweh a token of reverence on various
occasions, including: fulfillment of vows, visits to the sanctuary, supplication in
times of distress, and gratitude. 6 Schwartz also suggests that Leviticus 2 was
placed between the two major categories of such offerings (whole burnt offer-
ings in Leviticus 1 and sacrifices of well-being in Leviticus 3) precisely to affirm
that even the poorest Israelite could make a gift offering. 7 The Priestly material
also allows that for a purification offering, someone too poor to afford either a
sheep or two turtledoves may offer a portion of choice flour ( ‫ת‬ ‫ֹל‬ ֶ ‫ס‬ , Lev 5:11).
In the story of Noah, although the text does not explicitly use terms for “an-
ger” to describe the deity’s attitude in sending the flood, such a destructive act
in the ancient Near Eastern context presumes anger (Gen 6–7). The sacrifice
offered by Noah after the flood is pleasing to Yahweh and clearly implies a paci-
fication of divine anger (Gen 8:20–22). While animals rather than grain are of-
fered there, a gradation of offerings allowing for more affordable commodities
such as grain may be assumed in the sacrificial system presumed by this story.
The evidence from Mesopotamia and from the Priestly writings just discussed
supports such a presumption.

The Jewish Study Bible, 208–9.364Line 17 of Nisaba 1 concludes with the speaker’s offer to proclaim the god-
dess’s great achievements, an offer that fits the form often described as a con-
cluding “promise/vow of praise.” In the ancient Near East praise was conceived
primarily as public narration, likely accompanied by celebration, in which the
speaker attested to specific experiences of divine favor by which the deity had
confirmed his or her responsiveness and power. 8 This conception is reflected in
the Hebrew Bible. Biblical scholars classify roughly a third of the biblical psalms
as having a literary form known as the individual lament, whose description has
been heavily influenced by the structure of incantation-prayers (see page 61).
Like incantation-prayers, the individual lament follows petition with a vow of
praise. However, among the biblical psalms, such a structure rarely occurs in a
simple linear way. In Psalm 9:14–15, for example, the speaker’s petition for
mercy is followed by a promise to praise the deity in public: 9 “so that I may re-
count all your praises, and, in the gates of daughter Zion, rejoice in your deliv-
erance.” Yet, verse twenty of the same psalm voices another petition: “Rise up, O
L ORD ! Do not let mortals prevail.”
8
See, e.g., the poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, especially the opening hymn (page 483) and Tablet IV.
Both the verb used here (‫ספר‬ piel, “to recount”) and the location of the speaker suggest a pub-
lic performance.

T HE P RAYER :
While not completely consistent, those textual witnesses to the prayer that
preserve a rubric refer to our prayer in Sumerian as ka-inim-ma šu-íl-lá d utu-
kam, “the wording of a shuilla to Shamash.” 1 Several witnesses show interesting
variations within the text of the prayer. 2 For example, two versions of the peti-
tion suggest differing emphases. In several MSS , the self-introduction and the
lament are missing. This leaves the prayer with little motivation beyond the
general desire for a good life. The unnamed supplicant seeks a life filled with
positive portents. But the longer versions of the prayer, namely, MSS D 8ʹ–11ʹ, G
19–26, and I 17–22, which differ among themselves, contain a self-introduction
and a lament and are therefore more specific in their concern. Particularly in MS
G, the supplicant, perhaps a king, 3 is concerned with bad omens that cause him
to be continually anxious. The difference in emphasis of the prayer is accom-
plished simply by adding (or removing 4 ) several lines without otherwise modify-
ing the surrounding text.
There is evidence that supplicants recited Shamash 1 in a variety of ritual
contexts. Claus Ambos places Shamash 1, particularly as exemplified in MS A
(along with the other rituals and prayers on the same tablet) in the ritual series
Bīt salāʾ mê (“Water-sprinkling house”). 5 MSS α, β and γ quote the incipit, that is,
the first few words of Shamash 1, in their ritual instructions. MS α is likely also a
1
A, B, F and I. MS K reads šu-íl-lá d utu-ke 4 .
See Mayer, UFBG, 503 for the textual witnesses. I follow his sigla.
3
In MS G the supplicant is an unknown Aplutu; MS D reads in this place anāku annanna mar
annanna, “I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so,” the most common place holder in prayers; and MS I
reads, Šamaš-šum-ukīn, the seventh century king of Babylon. In the present treatment of the text,
lines 18–25 of the text, notes, and translation represent the major addition in MS G.

One cannot be certain of the textual history of the two major versions.

367368Bīt salāʾ mê (“Water-sprinkling house”) ritual. 6 MS β is a collection of medical
rituals and incantations. 7 It references several incantations, including ours, only
by way of their incipits. Of these, scholars have only identified our prayer with
relative certainty. 8 While superficially the whole of MS γ is identifiable as a nam-
burbi collection, the MS actually includes a mixture of ritual types. 9 For this
reason, it is not clear that MS γ is itself a witness to a namburbi context for our
prayer. 10 In any case, it is clear that some version of our prayer was used in both
Bīt salāʾ mê and various medical rituals.
The prayer has three major sections: a long invocation, an extended peti-
tion, and a rather short conditional call for praise.
A detailed structure of the prayer is as follows:
I) Invocation
A) God’s name, honorific titles and attributes (1–6)
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (7–17)
II) Petition
A) Self-introduction (18–19) (missing in the shorter versions)
B) Lament (20–25) (missing in the shorter versions)
C) Plea (25–43)
III) Final, conditional call for praise of the god (43–47)
A lengthy invocation begins with a set of traditional honorific epithets be-
fore calling on Shamash by name. The last of these involve the bringing of hap-
piness to the people and setting them free. These set the stage for mention of the
various skills that the god will need to meet the supplicant’s petition. The invo-
cation continues with additional honorific titles and transitions to a praise of
specific and special skills of Shamash. These skills, providing a lone man with a
friend, giving an heir to the impotent, etc., continue the theme of Shamash being
a provider of happiness and freedom to the people. The invocation ends with
praise of Shamash’s actions as judge of the gods and as one who gives judgment

Compare Mayer’s suggestion that MSS A and α are mīs pî rituals (UFBG, 503).
The incipit referencing our prayer is at BAM 322:64. See Mayer, UFBG, 503. On the composite
nature of this witness see Franz Köcher, Die babylonisch-assyrische Medizin in Texten und Unter-
suchungen (6 vols; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1962–1980), IV.ix–x and 322. F. A. M. Wiggermann, Meso-
potamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts (Groningen: Styx, 1992), 126 notes a possible associa-
tion between our prayer and those mentioned in BAM 332 that use the epithet ur.sag, Akk.
qarrādu, “hero,” for example at line 64. Other examples include BAM 3:28ʹ–32ʹ, also a medical
text, and KAR 253, rev. 8. The exact nature of this relationship if any is unclear.

Of MS γ Maul writes, “The basis for the combination of such diverse rituals as in KAR 72 will
probably always remain unclear” (“Der Grund für die Kombination von so unterschiedlichen
Ritualen wie in der Tafel KAR n72 wird wohl für immer unklar bleiben”; ZB, 175). And in note
162 on the same page he says, “The purpose of the first ritual (KAR 72, obv. 1–25) is unclear”
(“Der Zweck des ersten Ritual [KAR n72 Vs, 1–25] ist unklar”). KAR 72:24 is our MS γ. On the
multiple ritual contexts of our prayer see also Mayer, UFBG, 19–20.

to humankind by way of haruspicy, “on the exta of a sheep you inscribe the
omen; you place judgment.”
This praise of Shamash as judge provides not only an end of the invocation
but an introduction to the petition. Aplutu, the supplicant of MS G, first formally
introduces himself and then laments, “the sting of the flesh (omen) has befallen
me.” This directly ties to the previous reference to Shamash’s role in giving
judgment by haruspicy. But as the lament unfolds, we quickly learn that there
are other evil signs, broken chariot parts, red ants in the house, and other un-
named evil omens, that befall the supplicant. The lament ends with the stock
phrase, palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am afraid, anxious, and constantly in
fear.” The shorter versions of this prayer lack both the self-introduction and la-
ment. The plea proper asks Shamash, in his role as judge, to “decree” 11 favorable
portents, including good dreams and good fortune. To some extent, the final
three lines read as a continuation of the plea. But based on the rather set pat-
terns in such prayers, I think there can be little doubt that this section is condi-
tional. Unlike many other such conditional endings, these lines in our prayer are
the supplicant’s request that Shamash be praised rather than the more common
conditional vow that the supplicant himself will praise the god. 12
One might analyze the last section of this shuilla-prayer as an apodosis to its
plea’s protasis and understand it as the closing element of the petition. 13 While
the final section does serve such a function, it also harks back to the invocation
and creates, with the invocation, an inclusio for the whole prayer. The supplicant
enumerates many praiseworthy attributes of the god in the invocation. The ful-
fillment of the petition adds yet another praiseworthy element to Shamash’s
resumé. In this way, the final conditional section ties the invocation and the
petition together. For this reason, I think it best to consider the final section on
the same level as the invocation and petition.

Studies in Memory of William L. Moran (ed. Agustinus Gianto; Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute,

Mayer lists the ending of our prayer among a group of conclusions to prayers that he charac-
terizes as follows: “A short praise formula is integrated into the petition, and thus does not have
the character of a concluding promise or wish of praise” (“Eine kurze Lobformel ist in die Bitten
integriert, hat also nicht den Charakter eines abschliessenden Lobversprechen oder -wunsches”;
UFBG, 347; emphasis original). This group makes up one of three under his more general head-
ing of “Petitions involving the promise of praise, or wish of praise” (“Bitten nach dem Lobver-
sprechen bzw. Lobwunsch”; see UFBG, 347–48). Abusch, “Promise,” 6, also notes the existence
of deviations in the way shuilla-prayers end.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This marks the beginning of the
wording of the prayer. It is not actually part of the prayer itself. Šurbû, “exalted, supreme,”
is often used to describe deities and their epithets (see CAD Š/3, 341–42). The Š stem ver-

“to bring happiness” (see CAD P, 351). Nūra kullumu, “to show someone the light,” implies
setting someone free from prison. Note the PN Šamaš-nūra-kullimanni, “O Shamash, set me
free!” See CAD K, 524–25. Participial description dominates in this line and the next.

Line 3: d UTU = Šamaš. Muštēšir from šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to put in order, to
clear up, to provide justice.” The form is a ms participle (bound form). LÚ . ÚŠ = mītu, “dead
person.” LÚ . TI = balāṭu, “living person.” Barû, “to see.” Participles from III-weak roots
sometimes lack the final short vowel; it is preserved in MSS E and F. Kalû (bound: kal[a]),
“all, every.” The idiom mimma šumšu, lit. “whatever its name,” means “anything, every-
thing” (see CAD M/2, 75–76). Shamash can provide justice for all people, living and dead,𒌋𒌋𒁹 A S HUILLA : S HAMASH 1

Line 4: AN = šamû, “heaven.” KI = erṣetu, “earth, land.” Mayer’s MSS F and G replace
šamê u erṣetim with ilī, “of the gods.” KUR = mātu, “land, country.” KUR . KUR = mātāti (pl. of
mātu). Note the doubling of the sign to indicate a plural noun. Šarūru, “radiance.”
Šamaš nūr šamê u erṣetim šarūr mātāti
Line 5: EN = bēlu, “lord.” Ṣulūlu, literally “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor
of divine or royal protection (see CAD Ṣ, 243). É-babbar-ra = E-babbar, the Sumerian
name of Shamash’s temple at Sippar. See A. C. V. M. Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebab-
bar Temple at Sippar: Its Administration and Its Prosopography (Leiden: Nederlands Histor-
isch-Archaeologisch Instituut, 1997).

Line 7: This line is missing from MSS B, C, I, K. Upaqqā is a 3fp durative from puqqu,
“to pay attention to,” attested only in the D stem. Tenīštu (tenēštu), “humankind.” Rather
than continuing with the list of epithets, lines 7ff. use finite verbs in complete sentences to
describe Shamash. Lines 7–9 use verbs in the third person; those in lines 10–15 are second
person.
ana nūrīka upaqqā tenīšētum
Line 8: Qibītu, “speech, command.” Utaqqû (Dt of [w]aqû), “to wait attentively on
someone or something, to attend.” Mayer’s MS F reads the verb as upaqqā instead, mirror-
ing the previous line. DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Generally, the Igigi-gods are the lesser or
younger gods in the pantheon but, on occasion, the name seems to imply the whole pan-
theon. Mayer’s MS F reads GAL . MEŠ = rabûtu, “the great ones,” in place of DINGIR . MEŠ . Occa-
sionally, rabûtu is an epithet for the Igigî (see CAD R, 35).

rapšāti, is a common idiom for widespread peoples (see CAD R, 164). Ṣalmu, “black.”
SAG . DU = qaqqadu, “head.” The idiom ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “the black-headed ones,” refers to
humankind. They are like sheep led by their divine shepherds. Mayer’s MS G reads the
beginning of the line differently: ilu u šarru nišī ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “god and king, the black-
headed people.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Qurdu, “heroism,” in the plural means “heroic deeds.”
nišī rapšāti ṣalmāt qaqqadi idallalā qurdīka
Line 10: GURUŠ = eṭlu, “young man, youth.” AŠ (also read DILI ) = ēdu, “single, indi-
vidual.” See eṭlu ēdu, “single/lone man,” in CAD E, 36, 37, 409, and CAD T, 188. (Mayer,
505 reads the logogram as KAL DILI , but this does not change the meaning.) Tappû, “part-
ner, friend, companion.” Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause to acquire, to provide.” Description of
Shamash with second person verbs begins in this line and continues through line 15.
eṭla ēda tappâ tušarši
Line 11: Here lā is used proclitically to negate the following noun. CAD I/J, 226 un-
derstands lā išari as an idiom for “impotent” based on išaru, “normal” or “straight” rather
than išaru, “penis.” See also Seux, 284, n.11 and AHw, 392. Tanamdin (for tanaddin) is
from nadānu, “to give.” The –dd– often changes to –nd– or –md–, as here. See GAG, §32b,c.
One might expect apla instead of aplu but the nominative case ending often stands for the
accusative in SB Akkadian. See GAG, §63e. Note that MS D reads ap-li here, apparently
understanding the word as a plural (aplī).
ana lā išari tanamdin apla
Line 12: Edlu, “locked.” Sikkūru, “bolt, bar.” Given the plural adj., this noun should be
taken as a plural, too. Puttû (D of petû), “to open, to unlock.”
edlūti sikkūr šamê tupatti
Line 13: Lā nāṭili is a common expression, based on the adj. nāṭilu, “seeing.” Compare
ana lā išari in line 11. See CAD N/2, 129. In some contexts, nūra šakānu can be understood
idiomatically to mean “to provide joy” (see CAD N/2, 349). But here a more literal under-
standing is called for. Again, the nominative case vowel appears in place of the accusative
(i.e., on the object of the verb): nūru for nūra. The light of Shamash can penetrate the
darkness of a blind person.

Line 14: Ṭuppu, “tablet.” Armu, “enclosed.” A ṭuppu armu is a tablet with its envelope,
an encased tablet. Lā petû, “un-opened.” Šasû, “to shout out, to read aloud.” This verb is
often used with tablets or inscriptions; see CAD Š/2, 162–63. Shamash sees everything (see
line 3), even the contents of a tablet inside its clay envelope.
ṭuppa arma lā petâ tašassi
Line 15: Libbu literally means “heart” but can also refer to the exta (i.e., the insides)
of an animal. UDU . NÍTA = immeru, “sheep.” Šaṭāru, “to write, to inscribe.” UZU . MEŠ = šīru,
“meat, flesh,” here means an ominous sign (see CAD Š/3, 121–22). One should take in-
scribing the šīru as marking it with abnormalities so that the exta, primarily the liver but
also other organs including lungs, indicate some omen. Extispicy was a common practice
in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. Šakānu, “to put, to place.” Dīnu, “judgment.” The last two
words are added in MSS C and G; they clarify the judicial meaning of “writing omens.” MS
G also adds the following line between our lines 15 and 16: [Š]amaš muštēšir māti bēl šīmāti
gišḫurāte a[ttā-ma], “O Shamash, who sets the land in order, you are the lord of the fates
(and) plans.” Compare MSS D and F in line 17.
ina libbi immeri tašaṭṭar šīra tašakkan dīna
Line 16: Dayyānu, “judge.” Igigî is in synonymous parallelism with ilī.
dayyān ilī bēl Igigî
Line 17: Šīmtu, “fate, destiny.” Mayer’s MSS G and I vary slightly here. MS G has: [bēlu ?
m]ušīm šīmāt mātāti attā-[ma ? ], “O lord, you are the one who determines the fates of the
lands.” MS I: Šam[aš] bēl mušīm šīmāti attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the lord who deter-
mines the fates.” Mayer’s MSS D and F offer more significant variation. They replace the
text we have labeled line 17 with something else. MS D has: [Šamaš] bēl šīmāti gišḫurāte
attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the lord of the fates (and) plans.” MS F: Šamaš muštēš[ir]
mātāti attā / bēl šīmāti gišḫurāte attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the one who sets the lands in
order, you are the lord of the fates (and) plans.”
Šamaš bēl šīmat māti attā-ma
Line 18: Three witnesses, Mayer’s MSS F, G, and I, add four, eight, and six lines re-
spectively after line 17. These all offer variations on stock self-presentation and lamenta-
tion formulas. Lines 18 to 25 follow MS G (translated by Mayer in UFBG, 510). Similar lines
are found in MS I but they name Shamash-shum-ukin, king of Babylon c. 650 BCE , as the
supplicant (translated by von Soden, 319). MS D’s supplement is generic, using common
placeholders for the supplicant’s name. The variations in and rearrangements of textual
material evidenced here and in the last several lines are quite typical for Mesopotamian374

prayers and incantations. Consulting a critical edition is absolutely necessary to work
through this material properly (see UFBG, 506–7). IBILA -u-tú = Aplūtu, literally “sonship,”
is the proper name of an individual from Ḫuzirina (modern Sultantepe).
anāku Aplūtu mār ilīšu
Line 19: This line completes a common self-presentation formula, “I am PN 1 , son of
PN 2 , whose god is DN 1 and whose goddess is DN 2 .” d 30 = Sîn. d NIN . GAL = Nikkal, Sin’s
consort. d 15 = ištaru, here alongside ilu, means “goddess.”
ša ilšu Sîn ištaršu Nikkal
Line 20: Siḫiltu, “pricking, sting.” GAR = naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed, to be
set in place, to occur” (see CAD Š/3, 156). A passive form is required by context, either an
N stem preterite, iššaknam, or a predicative, šaknam; as expected, the form is accompanied
by the 1cs dat. suffix, –am (see UFBG, 91). Compare the first part of the line with the fol-
lowing: siḫilti šīri ana bīti šuāti iššakkan, “siḫilti šīri will befall that house” (CAD S, 235,
citing CT 38 47:41). This “sting of the flesh” is a negative portent resulting from hepato-
mancy (i.e., liver divination). The enclitic –ma connects the two halves of the line. The
second MA sign, represented as «ma» above, is a scribal dittography. UŠ . UŠ = riteddû (Gtn
of redû), “to drive constantly, to pursue constantly.” The doubling of the logogram is one
way scribes indicated an iterative stem like the Gtn. The –ni on the verb indicates a 1cs
pronominal object suffix. This line begins the supplicant’s lament, that is, why he is ap-
pealing to the deity for help.
siḫilti šīri šaknam-ma irteneddanni
Line 21: Here ina, in expressions like ina lumun, is causative or instrumental, meaning
“because of,” “by means of,” or “on account of.” ḪUL = lumnu, “evil (omen).” The words
that follow lumun (bound form of lumnu) in the next several lines indicate the sign of the
evil omen that perplexes the supplicant. GIŠ . GIGIR = narkabtu, “chariot.” MU is the logo-
gram for a 1cs pronominal suffix. A ḫuṣāb narkabti is a wooden part of the chariot that can
be broken by a horse (see CAD Ḫ, 258). Šebēru, “to break.” The verb ends with the sub-
junctive marker, –u, because it occurs in a relative clause (headed by ša). Particular omens
in this line and the next have caused the supplicant distress.
ina lumun mimma ḫuṣāb narkabtīya ša iššebru
Line 22: kulbābu, “ant.” SA 5 . MEŠ = sāmūti from sāmu, “red.” The MEŠ indicates the plu-
ral form of the adj. É = bītu, “house.” IGI -ru = nanmuru (N of amāru), “to be seen, to oc-
cur.” Like iššebru in the previous line, the form of this verb is 3cs preterite with subjunc-
tive. Several Akkadian omens mention ants and red ants in particular in their protasis. For
example, “If (a man has dug a well within his house and) red ants (kulbābū sāmūtu) have𒌋𒌋𒁹 A S HUILLA : S HAMASH 1

CAD I/J, 307–8 (and note page 359). DÙG . GA . MEŠ = ṭābāti, “good things” (sg. ṭābu). This
line and the next form a common lament formula (see UFBG, 101–2). This formula serves
as a basis for the textual reconstruction. The lament moves now to a very general and
vague lament about untoward omens the supplicant has experienced. Its generality permits
coverage of everything the supplicant—any supplicant—might be worried about.
ina lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti
Line 24: GÁL . MEŠ = bašû, “to be.” IGI = pānu. GIB (or GIL ). MEŠ = parāku, “to lay across,
to block, to obstruct.” When used with ana pāni, the verb means “to oppose, to confront”
(see CAD P, 156–57).
ša ina bītīya ibšâ ana pānīya ipparkā
Line 25: All the verbs in this line are 1cs predicatives. Palāḫu, “to fear, to be afraid.”
Adāru, “to be afraid (of), to fear.” Šutādurāku is a Št 1cs predicative (from adāru). It means
“I am constantly in fear.” See CAD A/1, 109 for a discussion of šutādurāku and related
words.
palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku
Line 26: In most versions of this prayer, the second major section of the prayer, the
petition, begins here without any preceding self-presentation or lament. The first and sec-
ond sections are bound together by šīmat in line 17 and šīmtī šīm here. Šâmu “to allot pow-
er, to decree.” Alaktu, “way, route.” Dummuqu (D of damāqu), “to improve, to make favor-
able, pleasant.” Note the imperatives, which are common in petitions.
šīmtī šīm alaktī dummiq
Line 27: Ešēru, “to go well, to be straight.” With omens, the verb means “to be favor-
able.” The form is a 3fp precative. Idātu, see line 23, here with 1cs suffix. This line and the
next belong together (see UFBG, 507). The linguistic parallelism is very tight.

Line 29: Šunat is the bound form of šuttu; it introduces here a dependent clause.
Naṭālu, “to see.” SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqti (f), damqāti (fp), “good, favorable,” pl. “good
news, good luck.” The word is probably to be understood as a plural, damqāti. But one
could read damiqti with about the same meaning. The choice between damqāti and damiqti
is in large measure a matter of convention. See CAD D, 67. Šukna is an impv. from šakānu
plus 1cs dative suffix. MS F reads terre, a ms impv. from turru (D of târu), which with ana,
means “to turn something into something.”
šunat aṭṭula ana damqāti šukna
Line 30: Išariš, “normally, correctly.” Alāku, “to walk, to go.” Išariš lullik is an idiom
for “let me prosper” or “let me have a good life” (see CAD I/J, 223). Lukšud “to reach, to
achieve, to accomplish.” Tappû, “friend, comrade.”
išariš lullik tappê lukšud
Line 31: The relative pronoun ša here means, “with reference to.” Ša ūmīya, should
likely be understood as an idiom for “during my life,” not unlike the English idioms “all
my days” or “in my day.” The particle lū, among other uses, expresses a wish in a verbless
sentence. It is related to the precative. Notice the connection here with line 29 above and
line 32 below via SIG 5 .
ša ūmīya lū damqāti
Line 32: Šutlumu, “to grant, to bestow generously.” The form is a ms impv. plus 1cs
pronominal suffix. INIM . GAR = egirrû can mean “reputation,” but it also means “ominous
utterance.” The reader should be mindful of the ambiguity in this lexeme. Several texts
associate egirrû and dreams. For example, “the šunātim and igirrê which I saw and heard”
(CAD E, 45, citing A 7705:13; see further Sally A. L. Butler, Mesopotamian Concepts of
Dreams and Dream Ritual [AOAT 258; Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, 1998], 151–57). Here the
context favors “portents,” perhaps “spoken portents,” over the far less specific “reputa-
tion.” SIG 5 = dumqu, “goodness, good, welfare.” Egirrê dumqi is a common expression for
good (spoken) omens.
šutlimam-ma egirrê dumqi
Line 33: SILA = sūqu, “street.” Ina sūqi is a common idiom for “publicly.” Magir is the
3ms predicative of magāru, “to consent, to agree.” In the predicative the verb means “to be
agreeable, to find favor, to be acceptable.” Qabû, “to speak.” The form is an infinitive plus
1cs pronominal suffix. Conceptually speaking, perhaps one might understand this and the
following lines against the contrasting context of Ludlul I 73–98.

Line 34: MSS F and G add two lines here (our lines 34–35). LUGAL = šarru, “king.”
Šūquru (Š of aqāru), “to hold in esteem, to give honor.” Note that gods and kings are cited
as a class to themselves, a class above the kabtu u rubû of the next line.
ilu u šarru lišāqirūʾinni
Line 35: IDIM = kabtu, “politically influential person.” NUN = rubû, “prince or noble
person.” Kabtu u rubû can refer to a person or a god. Texts often pair these two words.
Epēšu, “to do, to make.” Given the plural subject, we expect līpušū rather than the singular
līpuš. In light of the previous line, note the following: kabtum u rabûm mamman ša lā
ušaqqaranni ul ibašši, “there is no influential person or official who does not hold me in
esteem” (see CAD K, 27, citing TLB 4 22:29).
kabtu u rubû ša qabîya līpuš
Line 36: Ulṣu, “pleasure, rejoicing.” Rīštu, “rejoicing, celebration.” Ina ulṣi u rīšāti is a
very common expression referring to all the joys of life without its difficulties. (W)abālu,
“to bring, to carry,” but with ūmu as its object, “to pass time” (see CAD A/1, 20).
ina ulṣi u rīšāti lubil ūmu
Line 37: Kittu, “truth,” commonly deified as here (note the determinative). Kittu and
Mishar (see next line) are children of Shamash, which is appropriate given the fact that he
is the god of justice. Izuzzu (uzuzzu), “to stand.” ZAG = imittu, “right side.”
Kittu lizziz ina imittīya
Line 38: GÙB = šumēlu, “left side.” Mīšaru, “justice.”
Mīšar lizziz ina šumēlīya
Line 39: Atalluku (Gtn of alāku), “to walk, to go constantly.” The Gtn here is used to
indicate persistence of protection. Mušallimu is a participle from šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to
keep well, to give well-being, to heal,” functioning as an adjective. Á = idu, “arm, side.”
littallak ilu mušallimu ina idīya
Line 40: a-a = ayy–, indicates the vetitive, a negative wish. Naparkû, “to cease, to
stop doing.” Ipparku is the 3cs preterite of this quadriradical root; with ayy–, the form is a
vetitive. MAŠKIM = rābiṣu, a person or being (demon/protective genius) with authority to37841. li-ta-mu-ka d bu-ne-ne

Line 41: Atmû (Gt of amû [awûm]), “to speak.” The preterite (and therefore the preca-
tive) can be either ītamu (so MSS G and K) or ītami (so MS A); see CAD A/2, 86. Bunene, a
son and sometimes sukkallu of Shamash, as here, is frequently associated with Kittu and
Mishar. SUKKAL = sukkallu (šukkallu) is a court official. In some places, Elam, for example,
a sukkallu was a ruler. For other references to Bunene as the sukkallu of Shamash, see CAD
S, 359. In light of the verb, the “good thing” in this line (damiqti) is probably a good word.
lītamūka Bunene sukkalka damiqti
Line 42: d a-a, Aya, the consort of Shamash. Ḫīrtu, “wife.” Narāmtu, “beloved (wom-
an).” Šilim is a ms impv. from šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, well, at peace.”
Aya ḫīrtu narāmtaka šilim liqbīka
Line 43: Ašarēdu (ašaridu), “first in rank, foremost.” Rašû, “to acquire, to get.” Rišâ is
a ms impv. Rēmu “mercy, compassion.” On the expression rišâ rēmu and its variants, see
UFBG, 225. After this line MS F inserts [i]lu libbaka liṭīb k[abatt]aka li[ppašir], “May the god
satisfy your heart, may your mind (lit. liver) be released” (see UFBG, 509, n.129(1)). Seux
offers a somewhat different reading and reconstruction of this additional line (see 285,
n.33). Compare this addition with line 46 below, which provides a very close parallel and
is missing in MS F. Shamash is invoked one final time in superlative terms, as in the open-
ing line, before the final petition for mercy.
Šamaš ašarēd ilī attā rišâ rēmu
Line 44: This line and the following two comprise the short conditional call for the
gods to praise Shamash. This line harks back to line 4, where Shamash is called nūr šamê u
erṣetim, “the light of heaven and earth.” Ḫadû, “to rejoice (in/over).” Râšu, “to rejoice
(in/over).” On the extremely common parallel between ḫadû and râšu, see CAD Ḫ, 26 and
R, 211.

whole pantheon. See CAD K, 459. Karābu, “to pronounce a blessing.” Such blessings, often
in the form of praise, frequently come from the gods.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The Hebrew Bible occasionally applies solar imagery to Yahweh that is simi-
lar to that applied to Shamash himself. Ps 84:12, for example, refers to Yahweh
as “a sun and a shield” ( ‫ים‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ן‬ ֵ‫ג‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫וּ‬ ‫שׁ‬ ‫מ‬ ֶ ‫שׁ‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ). In Isa 10:17 he is called ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ‫אוֹ‬ ,
“light of Israel.” Solar imagery is particularly clear in Isa 60:2–3, ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫ח‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ְ‫ז‬ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ְך‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ַ ‫ע‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ,
“but upon you Yahweh will shine,” and ‫ְך‬ ‫ח‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ַ‫ז‬ ‫הּ‬ ַ‫ג‬ ‫נ‬ ֹ ְ‫ל‬ ‫ים‬ ‫כ‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫וּ‬ ‫ְך‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫אוֹ‬ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫גוֹ‬ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ , “and na-
tions will walk by your light and kings by your shining radiance.” The passage
shows a strong semantic equivalence to the imagery used in lines 2 and 4 of our
prayer. On the other hand, in Ezek 8:16, idolatrous temple worshipers are said
to be “bowing low to (towards) the sun in the east” ( ‫שׁ‬ ‫מ‬ ֶ ‫שּׁ‬ ֽ ָ ‫ל‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫ד‬ ְ ‫ק‬ ֵ ‫ם‬ ‫ית‬ ֶ ִ‫ו‬ ‫ח‬ ֲ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ‫מּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ֵ ְ‫ו‬ ).
Taken together, the cited passages approve solar imagery when applied to Yah-
weh but condemn the worship of the sun. 1
Line 16 refers to Shamash as “judge of the gods, lord of the Igigi.” It is in
this role that the supplicant calls upon him. 2 The Hebrew Bible uses the ‘Judge’
epithet for Yahweh and often portrays him in the role of judge. Ps 94:2, for ex-
ample, invokes the deity’s judicial role, ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ט‬ ‫פ‬ ֵ ֹ ‫שׁ‬ ‫א‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ִ , “rise up, O judge of the
earth.” Using an imperative rather than a noun, Ps 82:8 demands that Yahweh
exercise this role actively, ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ‫ט‬ ָ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ‫קוּמ‬,
“rise up, O God, judge the
earth!” (Notice the use of ‫א‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ִ in Ps 94:2 may reflect solar imagery, though
marshal imagery cannot be ruled out.) Gen 18:25 makes a similar reference in
question form: ‫ט‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֶ ‫יַע‬
‫לֹא‬ ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ל־ה‬
‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ט‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֵ ‫שּׁ‬ ‫ה‬ ֲ , “Shall the judge of the earth not do

See Mark S. Smith, “The Near Eastern Background of Solar Language for Yahweh,” JBL 109
(1990), 29–39 for a more exhaustive list of examples. Compare Ben Sira 50:7 with Ezek 8:16 and
Kuntillet Ajrud inscription 8:1, wbzrḥ [ ] ʾl with Isa 60:2–3. 2 Kgs 23:11 includes a type of solar
imagery, a chariot, not seen in our prayer but used with reference to Shamash in other contexts.
However, line 30 mentions Bunene, Shamash’s chariot driver. See also the apparent solar rite in
Job 31:26–28, where a lunar image is also involved.

Other prayers to Shamash further developed his role as judge (see Shamash 73:22–28, for
example, page 206).380justice?” In Ps 7, a psalm permeated with judicial imagery, 3 Yahweh judges the
people (‫ים‬ ‫מּ‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫ין‬ ‫ד‬ ִ ָ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫;י‬ v 2). In Isa 2:4 Yahweh will judge among the nations. The
supplicant of Ps 26:1 asks Yahweh “judge me!” ( ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ט‬ ֵ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ; see likewise Ps 7:9). Here
and elsewhere ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ט‬ ֵ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ is sometimes translated “vindicate me” because the suppli-
cant surely expects that he or she will be vindicated via Yahweh’s judgment.
Although the references could be multiplied, these clearly show that Yahweh
exercised a similar divine role in Israel as Shamash did in Mesopotamia. But an
interesting contrast comes up in a survey of biblical texts related to Yahweh’s
judicial role. On the one hand, Yahweh, unlike Shamash, who is the judge of the
gods, calls the gods to assemble to judge his people (Ps 50:4–5, where “heavens”
and “earth” seem to stand for divine beings). On the other hand, in Ps 82:1,
while Yahweh stands in the divine assembly (‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ב‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ק‬ ֶ ‫)בּ‬
and gives judgment,
the psalmist (Ps 82:2) thinks this activity is perverse (‫ל‬ ֶ‫ו‬ ‫)ע‬.
Rather than judging
the cases of the divine beings, the psalmist implores Yahweh to judge the cases
of the wretched, the orphan, the lowly, and the poor.
Lines 44–46 in our prayer find noteworthy parallels in the Hebrew Bible.
For example, these lines are thematically comparable to Deut 32:43 LXX ,
προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες υἱοὶ θεοῦ (parallel to ἄγγελοι θεοῦ), “let all the divine
sons do obeisance to him” (NETS), which is reflected in the text of 4QDeut q
32:43 (4Q44 Frag. 5ii): ‫אלהים‬ ‫כל‬ ‫לו‬ ‫השתחוו‬, “worship him all you gods.” 4 And Ps
96:11a illustrates a very similar motif to šamû liḫdūka erṣetim lirīška of line 44. It
reads: ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ‫ג‬ ֵ ‫ת‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫חוּ‬ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ , “let the heavens rejoice and the earth exult.” The
juxtaposition of “heavens” and “earth” as seen in this parallel is a common de-
vice in Biblical Hebrew and in many Akkadian texts. 5
While it is possible to make too much of it, we might also note the thematic
similarities between bringing sight, “light,” to the blind in line 13 and Yahweh’s
ability to restore sight as mentioned, for example, in Isa 35:5, ‫ים‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫י‬ ֵ‫ינ‬ ‫ע‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ח‬ ְ ‫ק‬ ַ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫תּ‬,
“the eyes of the blind will be opened,” and Isa 61:1c (Old Greek), καὶ τυφλοῖς
ἀνάβλεψιν, “and recovery of sight to the blind.” 6 The preceding context of the
Isaiah 61 passage includes bringing good news to the poor, binding up the bro-

kenhearted, and freeing the captives. It seems that both Yahweh and Shamash
can restore sight to the figuratively or physically blind.
In his ability to read encased tablets, Shamash can free their contents from
the darkness of their enclosure. A similar idea is found in Isa 29:11–12, which
uses ‫ם‬ ‫תוּ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ֶ ‫ר‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ‫סּ‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ַ , “the sealed book/scroll,” as a metaphor for prophecy. Yahweh
surely knows the contents of the sealed document, for he is the source of proph-
ecy. Note, however, that Hebrew ‫ם‬ ‫תוּ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ and Akkadian armu have but limited over-
lap in their semantic ranges. ‫ם‬ ‫תוּ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ is from ‫חתם‬, “to affix a seal,” or, as in Isa
29:11–12 and elsewhere, “to shut up, to close,” while Akkadian armu is from
arāmu, “to cover, to stretch or place something over something else in order to
cover it.”
The emotion, if not the language expressing it, reflected in the stock phrase
palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am afraid, anxious, and constantly in fear,” in
the context of an ominous dream, is similar to the report of Pharaoh’s dream in
Gen 41:8, ‫חוֹ‬ ‫רוּ‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ע‬ ֶ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫תּ‬ ִ ַ‫ו‬ , “his spirit was upset,” and the comparable report from
Nebuchadnezzar in Dan 2:1 ( ‫חוֹ‬ ‫רוּ‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ע‬ ֶ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫תּ‬ ִ ַ‫ו‬ ). But whatever parallel there might be
between the Akkadian and biblical passages is weakened by the frequent use of
the Akkadian phrase in many contexts that do not involve dreams. Using even
more semantically distant language, Dan 5:6 also reflects the dread of an evil
omen, ‫ן‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֽ ָ ‫ֽ ק‬ ְ ‫נ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫א‬ ‫דּ‬ ָ ‫הּ‬ ‫ת‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ֻ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫א‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ן‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫הּ‬ ‫צ‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫ט‬ ְ ‫ק‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬ ‫הּ‬ ֵ‫לוּנּ‬ ‫ה‬ ֲ ‫ב‬ ַ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫ֹה‬ ִ ‫עיֹנ‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫י‬ ‫נוֹה‬

A Shuilla: Sin 1
A LAN L ENZI
S IN :
Sin (Akk. Suʾen > Sîn; Sum. Nanna) was the Babylonian god of the moon
and a high god in the Mesopotamian pantheon. He was the firstborn son of Enlil
and Ninlil, conceived during their illicit relationship described in the myth bear-
ing their names. Sin’s consort was Nikkal (Sum. d Nin-gal). He was the father of
Shamash and Ishtar, along with a few lesser known deities.
Sin’s major cultic center was in Ur (at the temple É-kiš-nu-gál), but he was
honored with a temple or shrine in a number of other Mesopotamian cities, in-
cluding Babylon, Nippur, Ashur, and Uruk. Evidence for his worship appears in
some of the earliest cuneiform documents and suggests a pre-historic origin.
Sin’s cult is also known from the Syrian town of Harran. Although already at-
tested at the site in the early second millennium, Sin’s cult flourished at Harran
in the first millennium (at the temple É-ḫul-ḫul, “house that gives joy”), benefit-
ting significantly from Nabonidus’ infamous zeal for the deity. 1 (Nabonidus’
mother was a high priestess of Sin at Harran, and he installed a daughter as
priestess to Sin in Ur.)
The moon god was responsible for regulating the month, reflecting the Mes-
opotamian use of a lunar calendar. According to the opening lines of the astro-
logical series Enūma Anu Enlil this fate was determined for Sin by Anu, Enlil, and
Ea. 2 Within the same work we see the great oracular significance the Mesopota-
mians attributed to the appearance of the moon. In fact, the first twenty-two
tablets of the divinatory series are given over to the moon. (There were seventy

Worship of Sin continued at Harran as late as the eleventh century of our era. See Tamara M.
Green, The City of the Moon God: Religious Traditions of Harran (Religions in the Graeco-Roman
World 114; Leiden: Brill, 1992) for the religious history of the city, including an interesting
account of how the polytheistic moon-worshippers of Harran navigated (and survived) the Islam-
ic conquest by claiming to be the Sabians mentioned in the Quran (2.62, 5.69, 22.17).

moon’s first crescent (tāmarāti ša Sîn), and tablets 15–22 deal with the middle of
the month, the potential time for a lunar eclipse. 4 This background informs lines
18–19 of our prayer.
Sin was represented in iconography by a number of symbols, the most im-
portant of which is the recumbent crescent moon. This symbol is sometimes un-
derstood as the horns of a bull, the animal associated with Sin (see the incanta-
tory text A Cow of Sin 5 ), or a boat. In keeping with his calendrical duties, Sin’s
divine number was 30.
A few biblical names show Sin as their theophoric element: Sennacherib
(Heb. ‫יב‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ח‬ ֵ ְ‫נ‬ ‫;ס‬
Akk. Sîn-aḫḫē-erība, “Sin has replaced the brothers”), Sanballat
(Heb. ‫ט‬ ‫לּ‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ַ ְ‫נ‬ ‫;ס‬
Akk. Sîn-uballiṭ, “Sin has brought back to life”), and Shenazzar
(Heb. ‫ר‬ ‫צּ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ַ ְ‫נ‬ ‫;שׁ‬
Akk. Sîn-uṣur, “O Sin, protect!”). 6
T HE P RAYER :
The most recent edition of this prayer lists nine MSS that preserve parts of
the prayer and/or ritual instructions. This MS tradition shows significant textual
diversity, which must be related to the fact that the prayer was used in the Bīt
rimki ritual series (actually noted by Butler’s MS A) as well as in a namburbi to
dispel the evil of a lunar eclipse. 7 For the sake of illustration, a few examples of
this textual variation follow. MSS A 1 and B 1 include an attalû formula in its ver-
sion of the prayer between our lines 12 and 16 while MSS C 1 and F 1 , the other
two MSS attesting this part of the prayer, do not. 8 MS F 1 does, however, make an
addition in its place: it contains a self-presentation formula that names Ashurba-
nipal as the supplicant of the prayer. In contrast to this identification, MSS A and
B name Shamash-shum-ukin in our line 22 of the prayer as the supplicant. MS C 1 ,
though leaving out the attalû formula, presents a fuller text of the prayer in oth-
er places, with additions after our lines 8, 16 (several lines), and 26.

The present text is deliberately eclectic, including material that we deem useful
for readers trying to acquire familiarity with shuillas. This pedagogical text cannot
replace consultation of the critical edition.
Our shuilla begins with an invocation and a very lengthy hymnic introduc-
tion in lines 1–20 (minus lines 13–15, for which see below). Lines 21–22 create
a transition between the opening hymn and the petition section of the prayer,
which occurs in lines 23–34. The prayer ends in line 35 with a very brief prom-
ise of praise. 9
The structure of the long opening hymn deserves closer attention. It consists
of two parts: lines 1–8 treat Sin’s light-bearing qualities—eternal divine attrib-
utes—in relation to temporal beneficiaries, the people; lines 9–20 focus on his
authority and revelatory powers among the gods.
The hymn introduces the deity with an invocation and a couple of tradi-
tional epithets that set out Sin’s position among the gods (line 1). The following
couplet uses participial phrases (in lines 2b and 3a) to show Sin, “the perpetual-
ly renewing one” (line 2a), actively dispelling darkness and bringing forth light
for the benefit of the people (line 3b). In lines 4–7, predicative verbal construc-
tions and nouns with 2ms pronominal suffixes are used to depict Sin’s radiance,
again a timeless characteristic of the deity; but this depiction is clearly framed
by references to those who benefit from it—the people (line 4a) and the wide
earth (line 7b). Line 8 marks the end of the first half of the hymn with a report
of the people’s positive reaction to the deity.
Line 9 begins the second half of the hymn by re-invoking Sin as Anu, the
high god, and asserting his inscrutable knowledge. The following couplet (lines
10–11) makes lexical connections back to lines 5a (ṣētu) and 6b (kīma DN) and
uses predicative verbal constructions and nouns with 2ms pronominal suffixes,
as did lines 4–7; despite reprising Sin’s radiance, the couplet’s purpose is to es-
tablish Sin’s high position and esteem among the gods. Lines 12, 16–17 advance
the idea of lines 10–11 while also picking up on the theme announced in line 9.
Sin presides over the divine assembly, answers the queries of other gods, and
teaches them at his feet. In short, he is sagacious and worthy of exaltation
among their ranks. Lines 18–19 focus this idea further. The query of the gods is
revelatory (thus secret) and related to Sin’s calendrical function; he alone deter-
mines the length of the month, which had hemerological and astrological impli-
cations. Line 20 concludes the hymn in a manner that conceptually recalls line 8
(see the notes on the latter line below): people celebrate Sin’s divinity.
If ēmūq lā šanān in line 21 is a comment on ašarēdu in line 1, then line 21
summarizes both parts of the hymn by explaining or repeating the second half of
their introductory lines (1b and 9b). In any case, this line moves the prayer from
praise (lines 1–20) to petition (lines 23–34) via the self-presentation formula
that follows it in line 22 (in two MSS ).
9
My interpretation is based on an eclectic text. Individual MSS vary. See the critical edition and
the notes below. For example, the self-presentation in line 22 only occurs in two MSS .388The petition section of the prayer is carefully structured to move the deity
to respond to the supplicant’s petitions. The section begins in lines 23–24 with a
description of (prior) ritual actions performed for the deity’s benefit. These lead
naturally into lines 25–27 in which the supplicant explicitly calls on the deity to
act on their behalf. Both of these sections prepare the deity to heed the suppli-
cant’s petitions, which come in three groups (lines 28, 30–31, and 33–34). Line
28 contains the first and most general petition: the supplicant wants a favorable
oracle (note the imperative verb). Line 29 then establishes the supplicant’s need
(using a verb that is neither an imperative nor precative) in what we may identi-
fy as the prayer’s only complaint: the supplicant’s personal deities are angry
with them. Using three precative verbs, the next two lines (30–31) present the
supplicant’s petitions for Sin to heal this strained relationship. Line 32 establish-
es the supplicant’s course of action (using a verb that is neither an imperative
nor precative): the supplicant has commissioned Anzagar, the dream god, to
intervene on their behalf with Sin. The next two lines (33–34), using three prec-
ative verbs, contain the petitions related to what the supplicant hopes the dream
god can do for them: forgive their sin and restore them to well-being.
According to my analysis of this eclectic version of the prayer, the text is
well-structured to persuade the deity to respond to the supplicant. One may well
wonder, therefore, why and for what purpose lines 13–15, the so-called attalû
formula, was inserted into this prayer (attested in two MSS , Butler’s A 1 and B 1 ). I
believe the answer is fairly straight forward. First, the attalû formula concerns
the evil of a lunar eclipse, a matter that is directly related to Sin, the moon god.
Second, lines 12, 16–17, and 18–19 thematically establish Sin’s authority among
the gods and his revelatory knowledge with regard to celestial matters. The sec-
ond part of the hymn therefore seems to be an appropriate context to address
Sin about the problem of the eclipse. Finally, line 12 mentions “the decision of
the land,” which, when followed by the attalû formula, takes on that formula’s
clearly defined concern. Furthermore, line 16 describes the gods inquiring of Sin
for his judgment on the matter. The insertion of the formula between these two
lines, therefore, attempts to turn what was a rather general statement about Sin’s
standing and decision making among the gods into the specific concern of re-
solving the issue of the eclipse. If this interpretation is correct, the insertion of
the attalû formula here was a clever scribal intervention.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “ritual wording, incantation.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer on the tablet. It is not a part of the prayer itself. d 30 is Sin’s symbolic number.
d
NANNA -ru = nannāru, “light of the sky, moon.” Šūpû, “resplendent, manifest, brilliant,
famous.” SAG . KAL = ašarēdu (ašaridu), “leader, foremost.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Ašarēd
ilī is a very common title for various deities in prayers (see CAD A/2, 417). It is not specif-
ic to Sin.
šiptu: Sîn nannāru šūpû ašarēd ilī
Line 2: Given the lunar cycle, eddeššû (also eddēšû), “perpetually self-renewing,” is an
appropriate epithet for the moon god. The word may be taken as an attributive adjective,
modifying the deity’s name, or it may be taken substantively. Line 1 commends the latter
option. Nummuru (D of namāru), “to make bright, to illuminate.” Uklu, “darkness.” Obvi-
ously, the moon is the brightest light in the night sky.
Sîn eddeššû munammir ukli
Line 3: Šakānu, “to put, to place, to provide.” Namirtu, “light, brightness.” UN . MEŠ =
nišū, “people.” Apâtu, “numerous, teeming,” is often used to describe people. It can also be
used alone in the sense of “humanity.” The positions of the participles in lines 2b and 3a
form a grammatical chiasm while the following genitives (ukli vs. namirti) contrast with
one another semantically.
šākin namirti ana nišī apâti
Line 4: This line takes up where line 3 left off: with the people, the beneficiaries of
Sin’s work. SAG . DU = qaqqadu, “head.” Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” is a common
designation for the people of ancient Mesopotamia. It derives from the application of ideas
about shepherding to the social structure. The king is a shepherd and the people sheep.
The fact that the sheep in Mesopotamia had black heads and the people had dark hair may
have suggested the specific designation. Uššuru (D of ašāru), “to release, to send forth.”
Šarūru, “brilliance, ray.” The text describes Sin’s radiance here and in the next three lines,
without mentioning his active role in providing light (as in the previous two). Notice the
use of predicative constructions and nouns with a 2ms pronominal suffix attached.

Line 5: Namrat is a 3fs predicative from namāru, “to be(come) bright, to shine.”
= ṣētu, “light, shining appearance.” Although ṣētu is very close to the word ṣītu (log-
ogram È = signs UD-DU), “exit, rising” (see Foster, 760, Seux, 278, and von Soden, 316),
the latter is generally used of the sun’s rising, not the moon’s (but see the celestial epithet
in line 21). AN = šamû, “heaven.” Ellu, “pure, clear, bright” (= KÙ in line 26). The restora-
tion follows Ebeling, AGH, 6, adopted by Butler (382).
namrat ṣētka ina šamê ellūti
UD . DA
Line 6: Šarḫu, “proud, magnificent, splendid.” The adjective is a predicative (3fs); see
also lines 5 and 8. Dipāru, “torch.” We expect the suffixed form of the nom./acc. noun to
be dipārka, but dipāra- with a suffix is attested elsewhere (see CAD D, 156, citing BRM 4
50:20). GIM = kīma, “like, as.” d BIL . GI = Girra, the fire god (see page 145). Ḫimṭu, “burn-
ing, scorching.” The restoration follows Mayer’s suggestion (UFBG, 491). The lexical
choices in this line support the Girra simile.
šarḫat dipāraka kīma Girra ḫimiṭka
Line 7: Malû, “to fill.” The verb is a transitive parsāku construction, which is identical
in form to a predicative but is transitive, i.e., it takes an object (erṣetu). Namrirrū, “awe-
inspiring luminosity,” is usually plural. One might compare it to the word melammu, “radi-
ance, awe-inspiring sheen” (see CAD M/2, 9–12 and the lexical and bilingual sections of
the namrirrū entry in the CAD [N/1, 237]). KI = erṣetu, “earth.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu
(f), “wide.” Erṣetu rapaštu is a common phrase for referring to the whole world.
malû namrirrūka erṣeta rapašta
Line 8: The previous four lines have expatiated upon Sin’s radiance. This line reports
the reaction of those who have benefited from it (see line 4a and 7b). Šarḫa (see line 6
above) is an adverbial accusative of manner, modifying the line’s verb. Gutaššuru (Dt of
gašāru), “to vie with one another.” This is the only instance of this stem of the verb with
this meaning (see CAD G, 56). When the first letter of a root is g, the infixed –t– usually
changes to a –d–. Amāru, “to see.” Kâta, “you” (acc.). Although the text has mentioned
people already (lines 3–4), here people take an active role in the prayer. They jostle about
as if in a crowd to catch a glimpse of Sin. Perhaps we are to imagine people watching a
religious procession, straining to see the divine image as it passes by. Butler’s MS C 1 adds a
(broken) line here (see 283, line 8a), which may shed some light on the present line: [ ]
ana ilūtīka upaqqū kayyāna, “. . . to your divinity they are attentive (puqqu) constantly.”

Line 9: Sin is invoked as d Anum, the sky god, the high god of the Mesopotamian pan-
theon. The prayer is (rhetorically) exalting Sin, for purposes of praise, to the highest place
in the pantheon. The ša here is possessive, “whose,” anticipating the referent of the pro-
nominal suffix on milku. Lamādu, “to learn.” Milku, “counsel, advice.” Mamman, “some-
body, nobody,” is an indeclinable indefinite pronoun. The second half of the line changes
the direction of the hymn; in fact, it introduces its last half. The inscrutability of the gods
is a common theme (see also page 267). Its function in a hymnic setting like this, besides
the obvious idea of praise, is to contrast the supplicant’s helplessness with the deity’s pow-
er. The supplicant recognizes and confesses (implicitly) reliance upon the deity’s benevo-
lent knowledge.
Anum šamê ša lā ilammadu milikšu mammam
Line 10: Šūturu, “supreme, very great,” is a 3fs predicative. d UTU = Šamaš, the sun
god and god of justice. Bukru, “son.” Shamash is Sin’s son. This line somewhat parallels the
first half of line 5 and the second of line 6. The moon god’s shining appearance (ṣētu) is
likened to Shamash, the sun! Even if this is doxological hyperbole, the attempt to elevate
Sin is clear.
šūturat ṣētka kīma Šamaš bukrīka
Line 11: Kamāsu, “to kneel.” Maḫru, is a substantive meaning, “front, presence,” but
can also function as a prepositional phrase, (ina) maḫar–, “before, in front of.” GAL . MEŠ =
rabûtu, “great” (pl). The elevation of Sin continues. The great gods submit themselves,
which is the meaning of the kneeling gesture, to his authority. For the purposes of this
prayer, Sin is the most important, authoritative deity.
kamsū maḫarka ilū rabûtu
Line 12: EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision, verdict.” KUR = mātu, “land.” The reduplicated
logogram indicates plurality. GAR = šakānu, “to put, to place, to establish.” But the context
requires a passive, thus an N stem: naškunu, “to be set, to be established.” IGI = maḫru,
“front,” or pānu, “face.” The former is preferred by Mayer (UFBG, 175–76). Ina maḫrīka
means “in front of you.” The gods are not the only ones that submit to his authority; he
decides the cases of the land, too. In both lines 11 and 12 the submitters do so in front of,
that is, in the presence of the deity.
purussû mātāti šakin ina maḫrīka
Line 13: Lines 13–15 above are Butler’s lines 12–13 from her MSS A 1 and B 1 . These
lines preserve the attalû formula, a kind of lament. The fact that line 16 resumes the
themes of lines 11 and 12 (and the tone of praise) suggests the formula was secondarily392

inserted into these MSS . Butler’s MS C 1 in fact proves that in at least one version of the
prayer our line 12 is continued by line 16 (it lacks the formula). Butler’s MS F 1 , also inter-
vening between our lines 12 and 16, deviates from all of these other MSS by naming Ash-
urbanipal here in a self-presentation formula while leaving out the attalû lines (see 384,
lines 13a–13c; note also our line 22 below, preserved in line 19a of Butler’s MSS A and b, in
which Ashurbanipal’s brother, Shamash-shum-ukin, is named as the supplicant). All of this
textual data indicates how shuillas could be tailored to a particular occasion for a specific
individual. To sort through this properly, one must consult the critical edition. ḪUL = lum-
nu, “evil.” AN . GE 6 = antalû, attalû, “eclipse.” The following d 30 indicates this is a lunar
eclipse. ITI = arḫu, “month.” NENNI = annanna is a place holder; here it stands for any
month name or, following UD , day of the month. UD = ūmu, “day.” GAR = šakānu, general-
ly means “to put, to place, to establish” (see line 12 above), but here it means “to occur.”
The present case calls for a passive verb, thus we should read the logogram as an N stem,
iššakna, with the ventive.
ina lumun attalî Sin ša ina arḫi annanna ūmi annanna iššakna
Line 14: Á . MEŠ = idātu and GISKIM . MEŠ = ittātu. For the relationship of the two logo-
grams to ittu, see CAD I/J, 304–10, especially 309–10; note also Maul’s distinctive under-
standing of the words, discussed on pages 359 and 409 of the present volume. NU DÙG = lā
ṭābu, “not good, unfavorable.”
lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti
Line 15: É . GAL = ekallu, “palace.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. GÁL = bašû, “to be, to
exist.” The fact that both palace and land are mentioned together rather strongly suggests
the attalû formula was reserved for prayers involving the king, the one who ensures securi-
ty and stability throughout the kingdom.
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ
Line 16: Šalû, “to ask, to inquire.” SUM = nadānu, “to give.” The logogram should be
understood as a 2ms durative here and in line 18 (see Butler’s MS C 1 on p. 385). For milku,
see line 9. Resuming the theme of lines 11 and 12, the text again highlights Sin’s reputa-
tion for counsel and continues its expansive opening section of praise. After this line, But-
ler’s MS C 1 offers a fragmentary, deviating text for several lines (see 385–86 and Mayer,
UFBG, 492, n. 14[3]).
ilū rabûtu išallûkā-ma tanaddin milka
Line 17: Ašābu (wašābum), “to sit, to dwell.” The verb ušbū is a 3mp preterite, but it
may be better to emend it to read ašbū (see Seux, 279, n.19), a 3mp predicative. Puḫru,
“assembly.” The singular noun is an adverbial accusative of place (not the subject of the
verb, which is plural). Šutāmû (Št of amû [awûm]), “to discuss, to consider.” The object of
the verb is probably an understood milku from the previous line. If we accept the emenda-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : S IN 1

šaplu can mean “underside, bottom,” but here, with ina and the 2ms pronominal suffix, it

the divine council sits at Sin’s feet as students sit at the feet of their schoolmaster. Again,
Sin is exalted to the head of the pantheon. On the divine council in Mesopotamia, see Alan
Lenzi, Secrecy and the Gods: Secret Knowledge in Ancient Mesopotamia and Biblical Israel
(SAAS 19; Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2008), 27–66.

Line 18: The opening invocation is nearly repeated; the remainder of the line is an
adaptation of line 16. É-kur is the Sum. name of Enlil’s temple in Nippur, often associated
with the location of the divine assembly of Mesopotamian deities. Tāmītu (also tāwītum),
“(oracular) question and/or response” (see CAD T, 123–24). For preserved texts of tamitu-
prayers, see page 49. W. G. Lambert discusses the present passage within the context of
celestial divination in his Babylonian Oracle Questions (Mesopotamian Civilizations 13;
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2007), 6. The unspecified “they” in our line must be the great
gods or divine assembly of lines 16–17.
Sîn šūpû ša E-kur išallûkā-ma tāmīt ilī rabûti
Line 19: UD . NÁ . ÀM = bibbulu (bubbulu), “new moon, the day of disappearance of the
moon.” Tāmittu stands here for tāmītu (see line 18). Pirištu, “secret,” stands in apposition to
tāmītu, thereby expressing the common idea that divine revelation is secret—inaccessible
to humans. Butler’s MS C 1 varies here, describing bibbulu as ūm purussê ša ilī rabûti, “the day
of the (oracular) decision of the great gods” (see 385, line 17). This variant speaks against
reading tāmittu as tašīltu, “celebration, delight, splendor,” as some have done (see, e.g.,
Seux, 279; the sign for MIT and ŠIL are very similar). For the revelatory significance of the
new moon as described here, see Lenzi, Secrecy and the Gods, 165–66, n.145.
bibbulu ūm tāmittīka pirišti ilī rabûti
Line 20: UD . 30 . KÁM means “the 30 th day.” The Akkadian for this logogram is uncer-
tain. Isinnu, “feast day, festival.” Tašīltu, “joy, delight, festiveness, celebration.” DINGIR -ti =
ilūtu, “divinity.” Butler’s MS C 1 adds two fragmentary lines here (see 386, lines 18a–18b).
UD . 30 . KÁM isinnaka ūm tašīlti ilūtīka
Line 21: d AŠ . IM 5 . BABBAR = Namraṣīt, an epithet for Sin, which means something like
“Radiant Rising One.” Ēmūqu, “force, strength.” Lā šanān, “unrivaled, without equal.” This
epithet may be picking up on ašarēdu in line 1. The last half of the line repeats line 9b. It
seems the line has attempted to summarize the two parts of the foregoing hymn. It func-
tions as a transition from praise to petition, the next section of the prayer.

ritual actions and gestures described in the next several lines, however, are attested in
these and other MSS . Anāku = “I.” d GIŠ . NU 11 - MU - GI . NA = Šamaš-šum-ukīn (“Shamash estab-
lished the name”), king of Babylon from 667–648 BCE and the brother of the great Assyrian
king Ashurbanipal. Shamash-shum-ukin waged a civil war for four years against his broth-
er in Nineveh. ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.”
anāku Šamaš-šum-ukīn aradka
Line 23: Sarāqu, “to sprinkle, to pour, to strew.” Širqu (also sirqu, serqu), literally,
“sprinkling,” but generally refers to an offering of strewn flour. Note this word is a cognate
accusative of the verb. Mūšu, “night.” Ellu, “pure, clean,” conceptually must refer to the
offering, širqu, rather than the night. In lines 23–24 the supplicant describes the ritual
actions they perform. These are similar but not identical to the actual instructions attested
on some of the textual witnesses, which vary among themselves. If the actions in lines 23–
24 were performed, it is likely they were done before the reciting of the prayer (see Mayer,
UFBG, 208–9).
asruqka širiq mūši ella
Line 24: Naqû, “to pour out, to libate.” Šikaru, “beer.” SAG = rēštû, “first, pre-
eminent.” Šikaru rēštû designates first-rate beer, a very common item to libate (see CAD
Š/2, 426). Dašpu, “honey.” Compare the use of honey here with that in the ritual instruc-
tions in line 38.
aqqīka rēštâ šikara dašpa
Line 25: GIŠ . GÁN . LAGAB ? is obscure. Quddušu, “purified, consecrated.” Šumu, “name.”
Zakāru, “to name, to invoke.” After reminding the deity of the ritual actions already per-
formed, the supplicant makes their appeal in lines 25–27 for the god’s attention, what
Mayer calls the “turning” (Hinwendung) part of the prayer (UFBG, 122–45). The verbs are
probably best taken as performative utterances, the speaking of which executes the ritual
action. One might translate these “I hereby do X.” These lines lead up to the petitions
proper in lines 28ff.

Line 26: Šasû, “to call on, to appeal to.” Bēlu, “lord.” Ina qereb, “in the midst of.” See
line 5 for the vocabulary in the rest of the line. (Butler’s MS C 1 adds a line after this one,
see 387.) Grammatically speaking, the elements of lines 25–26 are arranged chiastically:

Line 27: For kamāsu, see line 11. Izuzzu, “to stand.” Šeʾû, “to seek.” Kâšu, “you.” The
verbs that open the line describe the bodily gestures that are attendant to the supplicant’s
seeking of the deity. These gestures are commonly associated with prayer. It may be signif-
icant to note that just as the gods kneel before Sin so too does the supplicant. The last verb
is a preterite and should be understood as a performative (see Mayer, UFBG, 170).
kamsāku azzaz ašēʾ kâša
Line 28: INIM . GAR = egerrû, “reputation, mood, ominous utterance, kledon” (see CAD
E, 43–45). Dumqu, “good, good fortune.” Mīšaru, “justice.” The first three words are literal-
ly translated, “an oracle of good fortune and justice,” but the genitives are best translated
adjectivally. UGU = eli, “on, onto, to.” Šukun is a G imperative of šakānu, for which see line
13. With line 28 the prayer moves into a petitionary mode, asking first for a propitious and
just oracular utterance.
egerrê dumqi u mīšari šukun elīya
Line 29: MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. d IŠ 8 . DAR .< MU > = ištartī, “my goddess.” The
transcription < > indicates that the scribe mistakenly omitted the MU sign. Ištu, “from.”
Maʾdu (mādu), “numerous, many.” Despite the u case vowel, one should understand this
word as a genitive, matching the case of ūmī, the noun it modifies. Sabāsu (more common-
ly šabāsu), “to be angry.” In this line and the next, the supplicant seeks reconciliation with
their angry personal deities, who apparently have been estranged from the supplicant for
quite some time. For personal deities, see page 431.
ilī u ištarī ša ištu ūmī maʾdūtu isbusu elīya
Line 30: Kittu, “truth.” Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace, to reconcile.” KI =itti, “with.”
Kittu and mīšaru are a common word pair (see CAD M/2, 117–18).
ina kitti u mīšari lislimū ittīya
Line 31: Urḫu, “way, path.” Damāqu, “to be(come) favorable, good.” Padānu, “way,
path, way of life.” These two nouns are commonly found together (see CAD P, 3). Ešēru,
“to be well, to go well, to be straight.” Both nouns end with a 1cs pronominal suffix (–ī). In
a well-balanced line that shows both grammatical and semantic parallelism, the supplicant
expresses their desire for easier days, which, following as it does on line 30, must have
been closely associated with a renewed positive relationship with their personal deities.39632. ú-ma-ʾi-ir-ma AN . ZA . GÀR DINGIR šá MÁŠ . GE 6 . MEŠ

East, figuring prominently in, e.g., biblical literature.

Line 32: Lines 32–33 are difficult. Uʾʾuru (D of [w]âru), “to give orders to someone, to
send, to commission.” AN . ZA . GÀR = Anzagar is, as the text says, the god of dreams (ili ša
šunāti), for whom see Butler, 83–85. MÁŠ . GI 6 . MEŠ = šunātu, “dreams.” Some translators opt
to make this line the beginning of a conditional sentence, in which Sin is the understood
subject of the verb (see Butler, 392 and Foster, 761). Others, the present work included,
take the verb as a 1cs preterite (a performative like the preterites in lines 25–27, see May-
er, UFBG, 199), thereby making the supplicant the subject (see von Soden, 317 and Seux,
280). Either way, Anzagar is being used here as an intermediary between the supplicant
and the deity the supplicant addresses, Sin.
umaʾʾir-ma Anzagar ili ša šunāti
Line 33: Ina šāt mūši, “at, during night time.” Given the role of the dream god, it
makes sense that the action will take place at night. Paṭāru, “to loosen, undo, release.”
Arnu, “guilt, fault, sin.” The supplicant desires Anzagar to release them from their guilt,
perhaps informing the supplicant through a propitious dream. The details of this idea are
unclear.
ina šāt mūšim lipaṭṭira arnīya
Line 34: Šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, whole.” All four MS witnesses read the first
verb as lušme, “let me hear” (i.e., “let me know”), which is difficult to understand in con-
text. The present reading (see Butler, 392) assumes that an early exemplar was corrupted
by way of copying a ME sign for the text’s LIM. The signs are quite close in cuneiform.
Šērtu, “guilt, offense, punishment.” Utallulu (Dt of elēlu), “be purified.”
lušlim šērtī lūtallil anāku
Line 35: The prayer ends with the usual promise of praise. Ana darâti, “forever and
ever.” Dalīlū, “praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construc-
tion; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomatically,
“let me proclaim your praises.”
ana dārâti dalīlīka ludlul
Line 36: This line is the rubric, that is, it tells something about the classification of
the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it
is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian.𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : S IN 1

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
There are several obvious items we could discuss in a comparative treat-
ment of this prayer with biblical literature. For example, we could compare and
contrast the nature of the primary deity in this prayer and the Hebrew Bible: Sin
is (or is closely associated with) the moon whereas Yahweh created the moon
(Gen 1:14–18). Despite such a difference, both deities are supremely strong (line
1, 21 and, e.g., Exod 15:2–19, Ps 66:3, 2 Chron 20:6), uniquely inscrutable (lines
9, 21 and, e.g., Deut 29:28, Isa 40:13, Job), and universally influential, filling
(malû  ‫)מלא‬ the earth with something of their divinity (line 7 and Isa 6:3, Jer
23:24). We could also note common ritual gestures and postures: kneeling is a
gesture associated with prayer and standing before someone often implies a po-
sition of servitude in both our Mesopotamian prayer (lines 11, 27) and the He-
brew Bible (e.g., 1 Kgs 8:54, Gen 41:46, 1 Kgs 18:15). Or, among still other pos-
sible comparisons, we could choose to consider the common use of “path” and
“way” as metaphors for the course of one’s life (line 31 and, e.g., Prov 4:14,
15:19 [‫ח‬ ‫ֹר‬ ַ ‫א‬ (Akk. urḫu)  ‫ְך‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫)]דּ‬
1 and “calling” as a common means of gaining the
deity’s attention in times of need (compare šasû in line 26 [and other prayers,
see Mayer, UFBG, 129–31] with ‫קרא‬ in the biblical laments of the individual;
see, e.g., Pss 3:5, 22:3, 28:1, 31:18, 61:3, 88:10, 130:1). Instead of looking at
these in more detail, I will turn our attention to the important idea of the divine
assembly and the royal image used to depict its leadership. 2
The biblical writers used the following terms to describe the divine assem-
bly in Israel: ‫ל‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ק‬, ָ in the phrase ‫ים‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ק‬,
“the assembly of the holy ones,” in Ps
89:6; ‫ה‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫ע‬,
found in the phrase ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫ע‬ ֲ , “assembly of god” (Ps 82:1); ‫ד‬ ‫מוֹע‬,
used for
the divine assembly in Isa 14:13 (‫ד‬ ‫מוֹע‬
‫ר‬ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“on the mountain of the assembly”);
1
Urḫu and padānu are often used with the verb ešēru (see CAD P, 3 and CAD E, 355). Compare
the use of the cognate ‫ישׁר‬ in Prov 3:6 (see Tawil, ALCBH, 32).

17 above for the full citation.𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : S IN 1
399
and ‫סוֹד‬, which is the most frequently used term, attested in the phrase ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫סוֹד‬,
“council of Yahweh,” in Jer 23:18 and 22, ‫ים‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ‫סוֹד‬ , “council of the holy ones,”
in Ps 89:8, and ‫לוֹהּ‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫סוֹד‬, “council of god,” in Job 15:18. These are the semantic
equivalents of our prayer’s puḫru. As one can see, this terminology offers us ra-
ther sparse data for understanding the divine assembly in the Bible. We there-
fore need to locate passages that may be thematically or conceptually relevant;
we need to widen the net.
Besides the broader contexts in which the above terms occur, there are
many other passages that offer evidence for Yahweh’s divine assembly, including
at least the following: Gen 1:26–27, 3:22, 6:1–4, 11:7, Deut 32:8–9, 33:2–3, 1
Kgs 22:19–23, Job 1–2, Pss 29, 58:1, Isa 6, 24:21, 40:1–11, Ezek 1:1–3:15,
28:14, 16, Zech 3, and Dan 10.
Reading these passages together, we may piece together an image of Yah-
weh presiding over his divine assembly as a king (see Ps 29, especially v. 10, Isa
6:1, and 1 Kgs 22:19). Like his human counterpart, here Yahweh held court with
his divine retinue (Job 1:6, 2:1), deliberated about the direction of various hu-
man affairs (1 Kgs 22:19–23  1 Chron 18:18–22), sat in judgment on other di-
vine beings (Ps 82:1–8), and commissioned human messengers to deliver his
words (Isa 6, Jer 23:18–22), among other activities. Like a king, Yahweh is pre-
sented as the ultimate and final authority in the divine assembly—as Sin is pre-
sented in our prayer (lines 11 and 17). Moreover, just as a king’s council would
often meet in the palace (the king’s house), a god’s assembly would often meet
in his house, a temple. Sin’s assembly met in Ekur, according to line 18 of our
prayer; Yahweh’s assembly is explicitly described as meeting in his temple in Isa
6:1. In other words, Yahweh presided over a divine assembly very much like the
one described in our prayer (and known from many other Mesopotamian
sources), even if he alone was considered a god.

A Universal Namburbi: Ea, Shamash, and Asalluḫi 1
J EFFREY L. C OOLEY
E A , S HAMASH :
See pages 227 and 197, respectively.
A SALLUḪI :
Like many minor gods, Asalluḫi (also, Asarluḫi) was once a minor god asso-
ciated with a minor location (Kuara, a site near Eridu), who was later syncre-
tized with a high god. In this case, that high god was Marduk. 1 The earliest evi-
dence for this syncretism is in the OB period. Though it is not entirely clear why
the syncretism took place, it is possible that Marduk, who was up to that point
essentially unknown in the south, was equated with Asalluḫi because of both
deities’ association with incantations. Later, as Marduk continued to grow in
status, his identification with Asalluḫi became entirely confined to such magical
contexts. 2 Alternatively, we know that Asalluḫi was considered the son of Enki.
Perhaps as Marduk’s regional standing increased and he too was afforded this
patrilineage, the two gods were simply equated. 3 Or maybe it was a deliberate
invention on the part of the Babylonian priesthood to give the upstart Marduk
legitimacy via a relationship with Enki by placing him in the Eridu pantheon. 4
Whatever the origin of the Marduk-Asalluḫi syncretism, the latter name is
almost exclusively used as Marduk’s epithet in incantations and prayers. In addi-
tion to this, the syncretism is grounded mythologically twice in Enūma eliš. First,
Anshar dubs the triumphant Marduk “Asalluḫi” (Tablet VI 101), the result of
which all the gods must obey his commands. Though this is not stated explicitly
in Enūma eliš, the logic seems to be that people invoke Marduk-Asalluḫi because
1

The connection of Asalluḫi with incantations is quite strong, even in the Sumerian material
(though Abusch points out that even this has been overstated; 543). Early evidence for such a
link between Marduk and magic, however, is significantly more limited making this hypothesis
for the syncretism difficult to demonstrate (Sommerfeld, 16–18).

403404the gods are bound, by oath, to obey his commands in the wake of the conflict
with Tiamat. 5 Later on the same tablet (but within the litany of Marduk’s fifty
acquired names), Anu also gives Marduk the name “Asalluḫi” (VI 147) as well as
two variants associated specifically with the Asalluḫi moniker, d nam-til-la and
d
nam-ru. The two names do not seem to reflect any deity actively worshipped or
widely (or narrowly) recognized in the society of ancient Iraq. Rather, they ap-
pear to be deified abstractions that reflect upon specific facets of Marduk-
Asalluḫi’s godhead. The ancient hermeneutics of name etymology in Akkadian
are beyond the scope of this introduction. Nonetheless, a few, brief comments
can be made.
The first of these variants, d nam-til-la, (VI 151) is grounded in the creation
myth: bēlum ša šiptīšu elletim uballiṭu ilī mītūti, “( d nam-til-la is) the lord who, by
his pure incantation, revived the dead gods” (VI 153). This mythic etiology links
Asalluḫi (i.e., Marduk in incantation, šiptu) with Marduk as the gods’ savior in
Enūma eliš (nam-til = balāṭu). 6 Nonetheless, the link that connects this deified
idea and the god Asalluḫi is unclear. The second variant, d nam-ru, (VI 155) is
explained in Enūma eliš as if it were the Akkadian word namru, “shining,” and by
extension, “pure”: ilu ellu mullilu alaktīni, “the pure god who purifies our ways”
(VI 156). 7 However, nam-ru can also be read nam-šub, a logographic writing of
šiptu! 8 In this case it is entirely clear why the abstract idea should be divinized
and associated with Asalluḫi.
In addition to this, both d nam-til-la and d nam-ru appear in the same order in
the god-lists. 9 There, the name d nam-ru is understood differently: Asarluḫi nam-
ru : Marduk ša mēti, “Asalluḫi is Namru : Marduk of the dead.” The scribe who
contributed this explanation in the god list understood the name as Sumerian
and, perhaps, interpreted it as nam = Sumerian abstraction morpheme + šub =
miqittu, “fallen one” (corpse, etc.), creating a (artificial) Sumerian word nam-šub
= “fallenness,” i.e., death. While this answer to the name’s Akkadian explana-
tion in the god-list is admittedly speculative, it is supported by the fact that the
name before it is d nam-til-la, “life.” Such polarized epithets are appropriate de-
scriptors of Marduk as Asalluḫi who is in command of fate, as our prayer tells us
(lines 2–10)
5
Thus, compare lines 4–10 with Enūma eliš VI 102–104 .
Note also, that Marduk, as part his personal armament in his battle against Tiamat, holds an
incantation on his lips, ina šaptīšu tâ ukalla (IV 60). The terms šiptu and tû frequently occur in
parallel (see CAD T, 441 for references). See also our prayer here, line 9.

T HE P RAYER :
This prayer (or more accurately, variations thereof) is unusually well attest-
ed. No less than nine copies, all Assyrian, have come to light. When it can be
determined, the only major variation between copies occurs in the list of omi-
nous signs, with one copy (Maul’s MS C) prepared specifically for Esarhaddon
that includes around two hundred specific possible portents. Our edition here
follows Maul’s MS A, which is the most intact in regards to the opening and clos-
ing sections and provides a workable copy for pedagogical purposes. This
presentation is in no way a critical edition, for which one should consult Maul.
This type of prayer, a namburbi, was employed during a prophylactic ritual
to avert the possible results of evil portents (see page 36 in the general introduc-
tion). Thus, the relationship between such prayers and the Mesopotamian mantic
tradition is significant.
Regardless of how we might organize the prayer, the scribe himself has in-
dicated his own sections by incising section divider lines on the tablet. Lines 1–
20 serve as the opening invocation, in which the supplicant identifies the gods
he is addressing and presents the personal situation which has precipitated the
ritual. The description of the gods is quite verbose in lines 1–17, and this is in-
dicative of the great “sociological” gap between the supplicant and the high
gods. 10 The supplicant, using a common self-presentation formula, presents him-
self as a mere peon who has been terrified by various gloomy portents (lines 18–
20).
Following the invocation is a list of those portents (lines 21–22 and into a
gap of indeterminate length). These omens vary greatly in number and content
by manuscript and are derived from divination literature, specifically the unpro-
voked types, Šumma ālu (terrestrial omens) and Enūma Anu Enlil (celestial
omens). 11 Preserved in the present version are general celestial omen categories:
lunar and solar eclipses, as well as stellar and planetary phenomena. These cate-
gories are all dealt with in separate sections of Enūma Anu Enlil. No doubt, lost
in the lacuna are specific omens within these general categories or perhaps ref-
erence to terrestrial omens. Though not the case in many other prayers, it is
because of these listed omens that we can be certain just who the supplicant
was: the king. Celestial omens always concern the monarchy and the state, never
private individuals. 12
10
For the issue of invocations and social location, see, most recently, Alan Lenzi, “Invoking the
God: Interpreting Invocations in Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments of the Individual,”
JBL 129 (2010), 303–15.
11
This is in opposition to provoked omens, such as extispicy.
12
Astrology, per se, in which celestial phenomena are thought to influence the lives and for-
tunes of the individual, does not appear until the Persian period.406In that gap as well begins the next section (presently consisting of lines 1ʹ–
12ʹ), 13 in which the supplicant describes the solution to these omina. The gods
should act in such a way so as to protect him from the portents and their ill ef-
fects. The image is one of winds that blow by—winds are invisible, but those
they pass can still physically feel the effects. The supplicant specifically requests
that the portents’ evil effects not be allowed to emanate from the ominous sign
(lines 3ʹ–7ʹ: lumuššunu ayy-izīqa, “don’t let their evil blow”). Thus, there is the
recognition that the negative portents will inevitably happen, but the supplicant
wants the gods to keep their ill effects from taking hold on his person. The sum
outcome of the gods’ intervention is the health and well-being of the supplicant,
who will thus be able to continue in his praise and adoration of the gods.
A single line (13ʹ [ MS A’ S rev. 14ʹ]) supplies the rubric describing this par-
ticular prayer: ka-inim-ma ḫul-meš dù-a-bi nam búr-da-kam, literally, “It is the
wording for the resolution of fate concerning all bad things.” There are at least
two references to this prayer (described as nam-búr-bi ḫul dù-a-bi = namburbî
lemni kalāma, “apotropaic ritual against any evil”) in the letters sent by Assyrian
and Babylonian scholars to the Assyrian monarch Esarhaddon and Ashurbani-
pal. 14 In both of these letters, the scholar recommends that the king perform the
ritual. In one of them, the unidentified scholar relays to the king that he should
modify the namburbi (as well as a prescribed shuilla) by inserting the specific
omina against which the prayer is supposed to act. This is the likely explanation
as to why this prayer has a number of variant manuscripts in which the rework-
ings lie entirely in the portents section. The text of this prayer was considered
adjustable to a particular ominous situation and this makes it unique among the
extant namburbi-prayers.
The manuscript ends with a colophon (rev. 15ʹ–18ʹ, not included in this
treatment), 15 identifying the copyist and, it seems, adding a bit of a curse, a not
uncommon feature. 16 It was discovered in Ashur, alongside related tablets in the
so-called “House of the Exorcist.” The copy is written in NA script but the lan-
guage is Standard Babylonian. As is often the case in such circumstances, some
13
The text picks up after the break on the reverse of the tablet after one illegible line. The pre-
served lines of this section in MS A are therefore technically referred to as rev. 2ʹ–rev. 13ʹ. Assyr-
iologists use the prime mark in these situations because it is uncertain how many previous lines
of the prayer are actually missing. In the present treatment, the numbering of these lines will
generally follow Maul’s numbering on pages 475–76 (thus, rev. 2ʹ–rev. 12ʹ = lines 1ʹ–11ʹ) with
one caveat. Maul has omitted MS A’s rev. 13ʹ (= line 12ʹ), which makes the rubric rev. 14ʹ (=
line 13ʹ). All lines after his line 11ʹ therefore should be increased by one (thus, his line 12ʹ is the
present line 13ʹ and the rubric becomes line 14ʹ).

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “spell, incantation, ritual wording.” d UTU = Šamaš. DINGIR = ilu,
“god.” GAL = rabû, “great.” The opening sentence of the prayer, which begins here and
ends in line 4, invokes the appropriate gods who are to act as cosmic judges. These lines
establish certain key concepts (dīna dânu, šimta šâmu, uṣurta uṣṣuru and isqēta ussuku) for
the hymnic section (lines 5–12) of the invocation.
šiptu: Ea Šamaš u Asalluḫi ilī rabûti
Line 2: Dânu (diānu), “to judge.” The form is a G mp participle. Dīnu, “legal decision,
trial.” The word here is in the bound/construct form and the ē suggests a Neo-Assyrianism.
KUR = mātu, “land.” Šâmu (šiāmu), “to decree.” The form is a D mp participle; for this root
the D participle is usually used in place of the G participle. NAM (. TAR ) = šīmtu, “fate, des-
tiny.” Maul restores NAM . MEŠ here (467), making MS A accord with MS B’s preserved read-
ing. But MS A writes NAM . TAR . MEŠ in the two other instances of the word (see lines 5–6).
Assuming scribal consistency, I have restored MS A here in agreement with the usage there.
dāʾinū dēn māti mušimmū šīmāti
Line 3: Eṣēru, “to design, to plan, to draw.” The use of the mp participle continues in
this line. GIŠ . ḪUR = uṣurtu, “design, plan.” Esēqu, “to distribute (lots).” In the D stem, the q
in the root is normally written with a k (see AHw, 249; CDA, 80), though here one could
conceivably read the last sign of the word as qú (see CAD I/J, 201). Isqu, “lot.”

Line 4: AN = šamû, “sky, heaven.” KI = erṣetu, “earth, land.” The writing KI -tim is
simply an orthographic convention—mimation had been lost in Babylonian and Assyrian
for a millennium. Alternatively, one could transcribe tim as tì. Attunu, “you” (2mp subject
pronoun). The –ma on attunu is non-coordinating here, putting the emphasis on the pro-
noun, which brings the opening sentence to completion. One’s translation should highlight
this.

Line 6: TI . LA = balāṭu, “life.” The precise nuance of the phrase šīmat balāṭi (and its
variants) is not entirely clear, but a simple literal translation will suffice (see CAD B, 48;
Š/1, 360). Tašimmā is a G 2cp present/durative from šâmu (see line 2).
šīmāt balāṭi attunū-ma tašimmā
Line 7: Tuṣṣarā is a D 2cp present/durative from eṣēru (see line 3). Note the close
parallelism between lines 6 and 7, which together form a kind of commentary on line 5.
uṣurāti balāṭi attunū-ma tuṣṣarā
Line 8: EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision.” Parāsu, “to decide.” The grammatical parallelism
in lines 5–6 continues in this line.
purussê balāṭi attunū-ma taparrasā
Line 9: TU 6 = tû, “spell, incantation.” Ṣītu, “product, issuance.” KA = pû, “mouth.” Ṣīt
pî, “utterance, command.” Šalāmu, “to be(come) whole, intact, healthy.” The form is a G
infinitive.
tûkunu balāṭu ṣīt pīkunu šalāmu
Line 10: Epšu, “action; sorcery” (epiš = bound/construct form). Epiš pî, “command.”

Line 11: The first half of the line repeats the first half of line 2, essentially beginning
the invocation anew. Kabāsu, “to tread.” The form is a G mp participle. Participles (again)

ings KI -tim and DAGAL -tim are simply an orthographic convention.

Line 13: Nakāru, “to change, to eliminate, to remove. Lumnu, “evil.” Šakānu, “to es-
tablish.” Dumqu, “good.” Lines 13–17, which begin a sentence that ends in line 20, offer a
transition from the introductory hymn and the self-presentation formula of 18–20. In this
transition, the supplicant establishes why these are the appropriate gods to invoke: they
are capable of reversing oracular fate.

Line 14: Pasāsu, “to erase, to obliterate, to negate.” Á = ittu, “(ominous) sign” (plural
= idātu). GISKIM = ittu, “(ominous) sign” (plural = ittātu). The plural by-forms of ittu,
idātu and ittātu, occur frequently side-by-side in logographic writing Á . MEŠ GISKIM . MEŠ , see
CAD I/J, 307–8 and the discussion of *idatu and ittu on pp. 309–10. Often understood as
simply a pleasant sounding word play involving synonymous plural by-forms of the singu-
lar ittu, Maul has argued that these two terms do, in fact, refer to two different things (ZB,
6–7). GISKIM (= ittu, plural = ittātu) is the animal, plant, star, etc. (or combination of these
things), by which the sign reveals itself (i.e., “omen indicator,” Maul’s “Omenanzeiger”). Á
(= ittu, plural = idātu) is the radiating (positive or negative) power of the GISKIM on the
affected party (Maul’s “‘Abstrahlung’ des Omenanzeiger”). One might not be able to pre-
vent a certain ominous event ( GISKIM ) from occurring, but one might be able deflect its
power ( Á ). ḪUL = lemnu, “evil.”

Line 16: Salātu, “to trim, to sever.” Qû, “thread, line.” Maul suggests that the qê lumni
was conceived of as a kind of incubation or development which took place in the time
between the omen’s indication and the actual calamity (ZB, 5) and, in a sense, tied the
omen indicator and result together. It was in the gods’ ability to sever that thread and the
namburbi-ritual initiated that act. Pašāru, “to loosen, to solve, to dispel, to unravel.” Nam-
burbû, “apotropaic ritual” (see introduction).
musallitū qê lumni mupašširū namburbê
Line 17: Mala, “as much as.” Bašû, “to be, to exist.” The form is a G fp predicative.
Mala bašû (and variants) is a common idiom meaning “as much as there is, everything,”
etc.

Line 18: Anāku, 1cs subject pronoun. NENNI = annanna ( NENNI -tum = annannītu), “so-

lines 4 and 11, mimation is written in a frozen orthography. Lines 18–20 comprise the
main clause of the sentence that began in line 13 and describes precisely: a) who the sup-
plicant is (line 18); b) what has happened (line 19); and c) the supplicant’s resulting emo-
tional condition (line 20).

Line 20: Palāḫu, “to fear.” Adāru, “to fear.” Šutāduru (Št pass. of adāru), “to be fright-

less, such eclipses were the cause of significant concern in the Assyrian court and every

Line 22: MUL = kakkabu, “star, constellation, planet.” Šūt, “those of . . .” (occurs be-
fore a nominal form in the genitive case). d A-nim is a frozen orthography—the mimation
had not been pronounced for a millennium. d IDIM = Enlil/Ellil. Maul restores d EN . LÍL here
(469), but I am following MS B’s preserved text. The “stars of (the paths) of Ea, Anu and
Enlil” refer to the stars and constellations which fall into three specific regions of the sky,
envisioned as celestial bands running from east to west, and often referred to as ḫarrān šūt
Ea, “Path of Ea,” etc. Particular astral features were associated with each of these bands
(e.g., stars of the Path of Enlil = MUL . APIN I i 1–33; stars of the Path of Anu = MUL . APIN I i
34–ii 18; stars of the Path of Ea = MUL . APIN I ii 19–35; H. Hunger and D. Pingree,
MUL.APIN: An Astronomical Compendium in Cuneiform [AfOB 24; Horn: Ferdinand Berger &
Söhne, 1989]). Erica Reiner and David Pingree understand the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea
to be variously defined sections of the horizon over which stars are expected to rise helia-
cally: Enlil the northern-most, Anu in the center and closest to the celestial equator, while
Ea lies to the south (Babylonian Planetary Omens Part 2: Enūma Anu Enlil, Tablets 50–51
[Bibliotheca Mesopotamica 2.2; Malibu: Undena, 1981], 7). The exact stars contained
within each path vary according to source. Based on the data provided in MUL . APIN , the
Path of Enlil began at about 13 degrees north of east, Ea extended south beginning at
about 11 degrees south of east, and Anu would be the area in between these two points
(Babylonian Planetary Omens Part 3 [Cuneiform Monographs 11; Groningen: Styx, 1998],
15–16). In mentioning all three, the author has effectively included all visible astral phe-
nomena involving the fixed stars exclusively.

Line 23: This entire line is only preserved by a few trace wedges in MS A. Enough is
preserved, however, that the text, preserved in MS B can be recognized. MUL . UDU . IDIM =
bibbu, “wild sheep, a planet.” The term is the common word in astronomical texts to refer
to planets whose movement, relative to the fixed stars, seems erratic at first glance (see the
Greek term πλανήτης, “wanderer”). In some texts MUL . UDU . IDIM refers specifically to Mercu-
ry (and occasionally Saturn or even Mars), but when it is generally used, as in this case, it
refers to any of the planets. KASKAL = ḫarrānu, “path, road, way.” The term here is being
used in its technical sense (see line 22 for discussion of the star paths). Sanāqu, “to ap-
proach.” The form is G 3cs preterite + subjunctive –u. In contrast to the omina alluded to
in line 22, those referred to by this line involve both planets and fixed stars. Conjunctions
of planets and stars were common celestial fodder for omens, and could be either propi-
tious or ominous depending on the planets and stars/constellations involved. For a full
discussion of planetary phenomena in ancient Mesopotamian celestial divination literature,412The prayer has a gap in its text here of indeterminate length.

am. The final m of the ventive has been lost with the loss of mimation in SB.

Line 13ʹ: This is the rubric of the prayer which is in Sumerian, as is typical of most
incantations: “It is the wording for the resolution of fate concerning all bad things.” The
sign NAM is usually a morpheme of abstraction in Sumerian, as it is in the term namburbî
(literally, “its release, solution”); but it can also be understood as the logogram for šīmtu
(written NAM or NAM . TAR , as it is in lines 2, 5–6). Here, the scribe is understanding NAM in
the latter sense, playing with the name of the ritual namburbî, “its undoing.” Thus, it be-
comes nam búr-da, “to resolve a (negative) destiny” (Maul, ZB, 12). MS B adds seven lines
of ritual instruction after the rubric and before the colophon which is to accompany the
prayer.
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
There are no prayers in the Hebrew Bible designated for the reversal of the
negative fate foretold by an omen. As in any other ancient Near Eastern society,
in ancient Israel there were a plethora of mantic practices, some of which were
sanctioned by the biblical authors (cleromancy, oneiromancy and prophecy),
and many which were not. In any case, we do not have from Iron Age Israel any
manuals of divination (if, indeed, there ever were any). Thus, there is no formal
equivalent of the namburbi-ritual in general or of our prayer here, of which it
was a part. This being said, there are, in fact, several biblical passages in which
the reversal (ritual or otherwise) of a negative oracular fate (delivered via
prophecy, itself a form of divination) is a central theme.
2 Kings 3:4–27 recounts how Mesha of Moab, following the death of the
powerful Ahab, rebels against his Israelite oppressors. In response, the new Isra-
elite king, Jehoram, assembles a coalition which includes both Judah and Edom.
The army encounters severe logistical problems due to the barrenness of the
countryside during their march around the southern end of the Dead Sea, and, as
a result, the kings question whether or not Yahweh is really in support of the
undertaking. They decide to consult a prophet (identified as Elisha), who pro-
vides them with a reluctant but unequivocally positive oracle that includes the
promise of ample supplies and utter victory over Moab (2 Kgs 3:16–19). The
kings’ expedition follows according to the oracle until the coalition is besieging
the last urban center, Kir-hareseth. At this point, following a failed breakout
attempt, Mesha, in an act of desperation, sacrifices his first born son on the city’s
walls. “A great wrath came against Israel” ( ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ל־‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫דוֹל‬ ‫ף־גּ‬
‫צ‬ ֶ ‫ק‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ְ‫י‬ ַ‫ו‬ ) and the coali-
tion army withdraws, leaving Mesha’s Moab bloody, but independent and, there-
fore, victorious. While scholars have variously attempted to slither around the
edges of the theological difficulties in this pericope, 1 the most honest and
A few examples will suffice: the text reflects multiple sources and is therefore sloppily incon-
sistent (Burke Long, “2 Kings III and Genres of Prophetic Narrative,” VT 23 [1973], 337–48); the
prophecy was reversed because Israel broke the laws of conflict as set out in Deut 20:1–20 (even

415
straightforward reading remains that Yahweh’s oracle delivered through Elisha
was effectively reversed by the ritual of Mesha’s sacrifice of his first-born. 2 The
king of Moab appealed to his god which was undoubtedly Kemosh, though the
biblical text does not acknowledge this overtly. The Israelites were fighting, we
must remember, not in the land of Yahweh’s inheritance, but in Kemosh’s home
turf. Mesha performed the most poignant and powerful cultic act available to
him, and the god of Moab responded to the king’s faith by intervening with the
oracular fate set out by the god of Israel. 3 This is in many ways similar to the
logic of the namburbi, but a fundamental difference is that Mesha is not invok-
ing the god of the original oracle, Yahweh, in his ritual.
A further biblical passage which displays the logic of the namburbi, perhaps
most strongly, is Isaiah 38:1–8 and its parallel in 2 Kings 20:1–9. When Hezeki-
ah becomes quite ill, the prophet Isaiah comes to the king (whether he has been
consulted or has come on his own accord is not stated) and offers the monarch
an oracle from Yahweh. It is not propitious: ‫לֹא‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ָך‬ ‫ית‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ו‬ ‫צ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ ‫כֹּה‬
‫ה‬ ֶ‫י‬ ‫ח‬ ְ ‫ת‬,
“Thus Yahweh has said, ‘Command your household, for you are about to
die and you will not recover.’” Hezekiah responds to the oracle immediately and
ritually: ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ל־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫ל‬ ֵ‫לּ‬ ‫פּ‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ְ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫יר‬ ‫קּ‬ ִ ‫ל־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫יו‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫הוּ‬ ָ‫י‬ ‫ק‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ח‬ ִ ‫ב‬ ‫סּ‬ ֵ ַ‫ויּ‬ , “Hezekiah turned his face to the
wall and prayed to Yahweh,” reminding Yahweh how he has served him faithful-
ly. 4 Both the supplicant of the namburbi, who admits his personal fear in formu-
laic terms (line 20: palḫākū-ma adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am scared, frightened,
terrified”), and Hezekiah, who weeps while praying, attempt to show deep sin-
cerity—and this sincerity adds to the legitimacy (and thus potency) of the ritual.
Yahweh’s response is almost as quick. Having heard the prayer and observed the
weeping, the god of Israel reverses the oracle, which Isaiah promptly delivers:
the king will live for another fifteen years and the city will be rescued from As-
syria. In the account in 2 Kings 20, the prophet then applies a dressing made of
fig cakes ( ‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫תּ‬ ְ ‫ת‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫ב‬ ֶ ‫דּ‬ ְ ) to Hezekiah’s skin condition, which is apparently what was
ailing him (2 Kgs 20:7). 5 While appearing to the modern reader as a form of
homeopathic medicine, we must remember that such healing procedures, espe-
cially if applied by a religious professional, were rarely devoid of religious di-
mensions. As in the case of Mesopotamian disease theory, the patient’s illness
though breaking these laws was part of the oracle! Joe Sprinkle, “Deuteronomic ‘Just War’
[Deut. 20, 10–20] and 2 Kings 3, 27,” ZABR 6 [2000], 285–301); the prophecy was technically
fulfilled because the army did, in fact, attack all of the cities of Moab (Raymond Westbrook,
“Elisha’s True Prophecy in 2 Kings 3,” JBL 124 [2005], 530–32).

The significance of the specific posturing, towards the wall, is unclear. It could be that it has
some ritual importance.
5
This act is placed after the sign of the reverse shadow in the Isaiah account (Isa 38:21).416was by no means a “natural” thing, but was, rather, the result of an angry god. 6
Thus, here changing the results of the original oracle requires multiple ritual
acts, i.e., the prayer and the application of the fig cake to the affected area. In
this sense, Isaiah is not only functioning as a proper diviner, but also as an āšipu!
To confirm the results of the new, positive oracle, Yahweh offers an alternate
sign: the shadow on a kind of sundial will go backwards instead of forwards. 7
This is a new sign for a new oracle and Hezekiah’s repentance has literally
turned back the clock on the previous prophecy. Again, this is the same logic as
the namburbi: the appropriate ritual can reverse oracular fate.
In 1 Kings 22 we have another instance in which the party affected by a
negative oracle takes action to prevent the oracular fate from taking effect. In
this passage, the kings of Israel and Judah decide to retake Ramoth-Gilead from
Aram. After agreeing to participate in the campaign, the king of Judah, Jehosh-
aphat, requests that the leaders invoke an oracle from Yahweh in order to de-
termine whether or not the undertaking has divine sanction: ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫ל־מ‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ט‬ ‫פ‬ ָ ‫יְהוֹשׁ‬

‫א‬ ֶ ‫יּוֹם‬ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ‫שׁ־נ‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫דּ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ , “Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, ‘Please in-
quire now the word of Yahweh’” (1 Kgs 22:5). The king of Israel assembles a
large group of prophets who uniformly deliver the deity’s blessing on the cam-
paign. Dissatisfied with this, Jehoshaphat asks the king of Israel for a second
oracle to confirm the first, and the king reluctantly sends for Micaiah ben Im-
lah. 8 Micaiah’s first oracle delivered in the kings’ presence is in agreement with
that of the group (1 Kgs 22:15). Incredulous, the king of Israel demands that the
prophet tell him Yahweh’s true will and the chilling vision that follows contra-
dicts the oracle delivered by the pandering group of prophets. The kings develop
a plan which, to a certain degree, recognizes the legitimacy of both oracular
fates—they launch their campaign, but the king of Israel (now identified as
Ahab; 1 Kgs 22:20) disguises himself, eschewing his royal garment for, we pre-
sume, those of a common soldier. The battle, as Micaiah predicted, is a disaster
for the coalition. Ahab’s disguise does not protect him and he dies as a result of
an arrow wound to the chest. The king’s solution to the negative oracular fate
offered by Micaiah is not a ritual one. Even so, the parallel to a well-documented
namburbi, the substitute king ritual, in which a prisoner dons the garb of the
king in order to absorb the ill effects of a negative omen, 9 is far too strong to

The sign (‫)אוֹת‬ here is not an omen, per se, in that it is not an indicator of the god’s will that
needs to be interpreted, but is rather a confirmatory sign from the god. Nonetheless, the rela-
tionship between an omen and this kind of confirmatory sign is significant: they both indicate
divine will.

ignore. 10 In both cases, the king attempts to avoid his oracular fate by disguising
himself. 11 Though the solutions are different in nature (the namburbi is a ritual,
that of Israel’s king is not), there is an element of logic shared by the two, even
if it is not as tight as that of Isa 38:1–8/2 Kgs 20:1–9. Oracular fate is not final
and can possibly be averted.
While these biblical parallels by no means comprise a single formal ritual,
such as a namburbi, they nonetheless demonstrate that the god’s will, as ex-
pressed through an oracle, could be changed with the suitable ritual demonstra-
tion. These demonstrations were appropriate to the nature of the oracle and the
person(s) to whom it was directed.

A Namburbi against the Evil of a Snake:
Shamash 25
D UANE S MITH
S HAMASH :
See page 197.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer is typical in structure and content of the incantation section of
namburbi-rituals. 1 The intent of such rituals is to mitigate or nullify the evil por-
tents of omens (see page 36 for more about namburbis). In the present case, the
namburbi seeks to nullify the portent of an unsolicited omen, omina oblativa, in
the form of a snake seen hunting in the supplicant’s house. 2 The formal structure
of Shamash 25 is as follows:
I) Invocation (1–9a)
A) The god’s name and honorific titles (1–3)
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (4–9a)
1) In terms of unalterable commands (4–6)
2) In terms of reviving the dead and releasing the captive (7–9a)
II) Petition (9b–21)

See Mayer, UFBG, 34–35.
Šumma ālu Tablets 22–26 (see Sally Freedman, If a City Is Set on a Height: The Akkadian Omen
Series Shumma Alu ina mele Shakin Vol. 2: Tablets 22–40 [Occasional Publications of the Samuel
Noah Kramer Fund 19; Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum Babylonian Section,
2006], 6–130) contain a large number of snake related omens. Of the hundreds of snake-related
omens in Šumma ālu none exactly matches the two elements (a snake seen entering a man’s
house and hunting there) that one would expect in the protasis if our prayer was intended to
mitigate one of these portents. The protasis of Šumma ālu 23:106 (ibid., 46–47) addresses a
snake entering a man’s house, “if a snake enters a man’s house, that house will be abandoned.”
Several omen protases address snakes hunting specific prey in a man’s house. For example,
Šumma ālu 25–26 ii 6ʹ-7ʹ (ibid., 106–7) and Šumma ālu 25–26:16ʹ, 22ʹ (ibid., 118–19). Regarding
snake omens and namburbi-rituals, see Erica Reiner, Astral Magic in Babylonia (TAPS 85/4; Phil-
adelphia: The American Philosophical Society, 1995), 83, n.338.

421422A) Self-presentation (9b–13)
B) Acknowledgement of reverential stance vis-a-vis the god (14–15)
C) Lament (16–20a)
D) Plea (20b–21)
III) Conditional promise of praise for the god (22–26) 3
The prayer begins with an invocation that not only calls upon Shamash in
terms of several of his honorific titles but also in terms of the effectiveness of his
commands. The invocation ends with reference to Shamash’s ability to revive
the dead and release the captive. The reference to these powers provides a tran-
sition to the petition, where the supplicant first introduces themselves and then,
using the language of submission, “seize your hem,” indicates their reverential
posture. Here follows a lament in which the supplicant expresses their fears re-
garding the evil portent of a snake seen hunting in their house and pleas to be
saved. Just as Shamash can release the captive, the supplicant desires that Sha-
mash release them from the evil portent. Finally, the supplicant provides Sha-
mash with motivation. If Shamash saves them, they will be able to praise Sha-
mash and in so doing will inspire others to do the same.
Unfortunately, the one tablet that bears the text of this prayer (VAT 5) lacks
ritual instructions; it only preserves the prayer. Since there are a number of
namburbi-rituals against the evil of snakes, 4 it is impossible to reconstruct the
precise ritual instructions that might have once been associated with our par-
ticular prayer. But another namburbi-ritual that seeks to nullify the evil portent
of a snake hunting in a house incorporates a prayer very similar to ours and may
shed light on the kinds of ritual actions that could have been prescribed to ac-
company our prayer. 5 The ritual begins with the words “namburbî lumun ṣēri ana
amīli lā iṭeḫḫe lumuššu amīla lā išakkan, “a namburbi (that) the evil of a snake may
See Mayer, UFBG, 35, for a summary of the more common, two-part analysis of this prayer.
Mayer uses Shamash 25 as a paradigm example of the structure of a namburbi-prayer. Differing
slightly from Mayer, I take the conditional offer of praise as a separate unit. See Shamash 1, page
369, for discussion. Separating the “acknowledgement of reverential stance” from the “self-
introduction,” I also see the structure of the petition section of the prayer as somewhat more
complex than does Mayer.

See the eight examples in Maul, 270–303. See also now BM 43090+ and BM 42559+, pub-
lished by Irvine L. Finkel, “On Late Babylonian Medical Training,” in Wisdom, Gods and Litera-
ture: Studies in Assyriology in Honour of W. G. Lambert (ed. A. R. George and Irving Finkel;
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 137–224, here 206–7, texts 49A and 49B. Finkel has also
published several Old Babylonian incantations related to snakes (“On some Dog, Snake and
Scorpion Incantations,” in Mesopotamian Magic: Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspectives
[ed. Tzvi Abusch and K. van der Toorn; Groningen: Styx, 1999], 211–52, here 223–34). These
incantations, however, are not namburbi-prayers in structure; they appear to address the direct
danger of snakes rather than their ominous portents. As such, they provide a significant contrast
with prayers such as Shamash 25.

See Maul, 278–82, 80-7-19,88, obv. 7–rev. 15 and minor variants. While this text provides a
close parallel to our prayer, it is sufficiently different to preclude it from being an alternative
witness to Shamash 25.

not approach a man, (that) its evil may not affect a man.” According to its ritual
instructions, at sunset the practitioner draws water, mixes in various plant prod-
ucts (barleys, emmer, lentils) and metals (silver and gold), and sets them “under
the stars.” In a secluded place, they prepare a reed altar for Shamash. They place
various items including bread, honey, and ghee on and around the altar. The
practitioner dips various stones (carnelian, lapis lazuli, plus several others) and
metals (copper, tin, silver, and gold) in oil and then makes a necklace from them
for the supplicant. At this point, the exact actions of the practitioner are unclear
but eventually they make the supplicant recite an incantation that is very much
like Shamash 25.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, spell, ritual wording.” On the various uses of this
word, see CAD Š/3, 86–91. d UTU = Šamaš. Šarru, “king.” AN -e = šamê from šamû, “heav-
en.” KI = erṣetim, “earth.” The stock phrase šar šamê u erṣetim, “king of heaven and earth,”
has Sumerian antecedents and was applied to several gods, most notably Enlil. The sen-
tence that begins here ends in line 9a.
šiptu: Šamaš šar šamê u erṣetim
Line 2: EN = bēlu, “lord.” Kittu, “truth,” was commonly deified, as was mīšaru, “jus-
tice.” As such, they are the children of Shamash. See Shamash 1, lines 37–38 on page 377.
bēl kitti u mīšari
Line 3: The tablet is abraded in various parts of this line. The reading follows Maul,
296, n.8. Anunnakkū is a collective name from Sumerian that likely originally specified all
the gods of the pantheon but later, and particularly in Akkadian contexts, may only refer
to gods of earth and the underworld (see Black and Green, 34). GIDIM = eṭemmu, “spirit of
the dead, ghosts.” The eṭemmū were normally inhabitants of the underworld (see Black and
Green, 88–89 and page 133 in this book). Bēl anunnakkī bēl eṭemmī is a common divine
epithet for Shamash (see CAD E, 398).

Line 4: Annu, “approval, consent.” The 3ms pronominal suffix on the noun is redun-
dant with the relative pronoun; together they can be rendered “whose.” The relative pro-
noun heads a clause that ends in line 6. Note the consonance between the first words of
line 4 and lā innû in line 5. An annu is often a positive divine answer to a query. Note, for
example, ša ilum annam lā ippalūšu, “to which the god will not give a positive answer”
(cited in CAD A/2, 135). DINGIR = ilu, “god.” Mammam, “somebody.” The presence of ilu
puts us in the divine realm. With a negative, mammam means “nobody.” Thus, “no god.”
ša annašu ilu mammam
Line 5: NU = lā. BAL -ú = enû, “to change, to revise.” Innû is a G durative with sub-
junctive –u. Qibītu, “word, command.” Qibīssu has a 3ms pronominal suffix attached; the
adjacent –tš– becomes –ss–. The word should be taken as the subject of the verb in the
following line.
lā innû qibīssu
Line 6: The somewhat damaged text appears to read uš-NU-pe-e-li (see CAD Š/3, 323),
but Maul’s emendation, used here, is certainly correct (296). Šutepêlu (Št pass. of šupêlu),
“to be changed” (the root is a Š-group middle weak quadriliteral; see GAG, §109j). The
verb is a 3cs durative. Since this line continues the relative clause started in line 4, we
expect a verb in the subjunctive here, uštepellu. See CAD Š/3, 323 for examples of both the
subjunctive and the form used here.
lā uštepêli
Line 7: LÚ . ÚŠ = mītu, “a dead person.” In some contexts mītu appears to mean “grave-
ly ill.” Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to revive, to bring back to life,” is an inf., perhaps best ren-
dered here as a gerund (see also the inf. in line 8). For mīta bulluṭu, see CAD M/2, 141.
With regard to Shamash, note the personal name Šamaš-mītam-uballiṭ, “Shamash-Revives-
the-Dead.” This line and the next two bring the invocation to an end with references to
those aspects of Shamash’s nature that are most important to the petition that follows. Not
only does this line and the next give emphasis to the invocation, they also provide a transi-
tion to the petition. The reprise of a direct call to Shamash by name lends emphasis to
lines 7 and 8.
Šamaš mīta bulluṭu
Line 8: Kasû, “bound, a captive.” Paṭāru, “to loosen, to release,” is another inf. Notice
the grammatical parallelism with mīta bulluṭu in line 7.

Line 9: ŠU = qātu, “hand.” ŠU . II , ŠU + two vertical wedges (the MIN sign), indicates
the dual; qātī is the oblique dual form. Here “your hands” should be understood as “in
your power.” CAD Q, 189 restores <ina> before šu. II -ka-ma. While rare, the omission of
the preposition is not unknown. No meaning is lost. See CAD Q, 192 for examples of qātu,
meaning “in your/his power,” without the preposition in constructions with verbs. The
invocation of the deity’s name again here provides a transition into the petition section of
the prayer.

cally before a person or god. The reading is difficult. Maul, 297, reads G [ U ] B -ka. Mayer,
UFBG, 139, citing the common expression maḫarka azziz, suggests the reading adopted
here. It is possible that the scribe confounded ana maḫarka azziz and simply added ka (See
Maul, 297, n.12; Mayer, UFBG, 139; and Seux, 364, n.4).

from ṣabātu, “to seize, to take hold of.” On sissikta with ṣabātu as a gesture of supplication
to a god, see CAD Ṣ, 18. Ṣabātu is also used in legal contexts and as an indication of sub-
mission to a king or someone else in authority. Sissiktaka aṣbat can also mean “to swear an
oath.” See further, André Finet, “Les symboles du cheveu, du bord du vêtements et de

sissiktaka aṣbat
Line 16: With this line and the next, we come to the central petition of the prayer: a
bad omen in the form of a snake pursuing prey in the house. This subsection begins with a
lament that continues through the first part of line 20. Here ina, in expressions like ina
lumun X, has a causative or instrumental meaning, “because, by means of, on account of.”
Contrast this with the meaning of the second ina in our line. ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, misery.”
MUŠ = ṣerru (ṣēru), “serpent, snake.” É = bītu, “house.” The relative pronoun ša begins a
clause that describes which snake the supplicant is talking about. The clause ends with the
subjunctive verb amuru in line 18.
ina lumun ṣerri ša ina bitīya
Line 17: Maul reads [ ]- IGI -ru-ma at the beginning of the line (297). The text above
follows CAD E, 205 ([e]-ši(IGI)-ru-ma). Ešēru, “to make straight, to proceed.” This infinitive
and the one in line 18 describe what the supplicant saw the snake do. The –ma functions
as a marker of continuity of activity, “and then.” Buʾ(ʾ)uru (bûru) “hunting; game, prey”
(see CAD B, 366 and CDA, 51).
ešērū-ma bûru
Line 18: DÙ -šú = epēšu, “to do, to make,” but with buʾ(ʾ)uru, “to hunt.” On this idiom,
see CAD E, 205 and B, 366. Amāru, “to see.”
epēšu amurū-ma
Line 19: All the verbs in this line and the next are 1cs predicatives. Palāḫu, “to fear,
to be afraid.” Adāru, “to be afraid (of), to fear.” We expect adrāku rather than adrāka (see𒌋𒌋𒐼 A N AMBURBI AGAINST THE E VIL OF A S NAKE : S HAMASH 25

Mayer, UFBG, 73). Palḫāku adrāku (u) sutādurāku is a stock expression in prayers.

Line 20: Šutādurāku is a Št 1cs predicative (from adāru). It means “I am constantly in
fear.” See CAD A/1, 109 for a discussion of šutādurāku and related words. BI = šuāti, a
gen. 3ms independent demonstrative pronoun.
u šutādurāku ina lumni šuāti
Line 21: Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to make pass by, to avert.” The form is a ms impv. plus
1cs acc. pronominal suffix. See CAD E, 394 for this stock phrase. This plea, the only one in
the prayer, ends the petition section of the prayer.
šūtiqannī-ma
Line 22: Narbû, “greatness.” Šāpû (Š of [w]apû), “to proclaim, to announce.” Lušāpi is
a 1cs precative. This line begins the prayer’s final section, the conditional promise of
praise. The first two lines are stock phrases (see CAD A/2, 202–3).
narbīka lušāpi
Line 23: Dalīlīka from dalīlu, “praise, glory, fame.” It is common for dalīlu to be in the
plural, particularly when referring to gods or kings and always when used with dalālu (see
CAD D, 50). Dalālu, “to glorify, to proclaim.” Ludlul, like lušāpi, is a 1cs precative. Those
who read or heard this very common doxological phrase would have been well aware of
the binding consonance within and between these two words. While clumsy as a transla-
tion, “your praises, let me praise” is a reasonable representation of the vocabulary, gram-
mar, and to some extent consonance.
dalīlīka ludlul
Line 24: Āmirūya (from amāru, see line 18) is a G mp participle plus a 1cs pronominal
suffix. The preposition ana governs the noun in the next line.
āmirūya ana
Line 25: Dārītu, “eternity,” is in the plural here, darâtu, though we expect a gen.,
darâti. Ana darâti means “forever, eternally.” Maul (297, n.13) notes that one expects dalīlī
with a 2ms pronominal suffix (–ka). The above notation indicates the scribe has mistaken-
ly omitted it. Note the alliteration between darâtu and dalīlīka that binds these words to-
gether in much the same way as dalīlīka ludlul are bound together by consonance both here42826. lid-lu-lu TE . ÉN
and in line 23. The whole phrase, darâtu dalīlīka lidlulū, is bound tightly by both allitera-
tion and consonance.
ana darâtu dalīlīka
Line 26: Although Maul adopts LID as the best reading, he suggests that the first sign
in the line might be read NI (297). In other words, the first sign may be an example of the
poorly attested líd reading. One’s decision on this does not affect the meaning. Maul’s copy
appears to favor reading lid (542). Lidlulū is a 3mp precative from dalālu. The subject of
dalālu has changed from the supplicant, line 23, to those who see the supplicant here.
TE . ÉN follows the prayer just as ÉN precedes it. Together they form an inclusio, delineating
the beginning and the end of the prayer.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Shamash 25 deals with dispelling the evil portent of snakes, ṣerru, hunting
in one’s house. While there are several different words for “snake” and “serpent”
in Hebrew, ‫שׁ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ָ‫נ‬ is the most frequently used and is likely the closest semantic
equivalent to Akkadian ṣerru (ṣēru). Jer 8:17 and Qoh 10:11 both mention spells
( ‫שׁ‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ל‬ ַ ) against snakes. However, unlike the underlying assumption of Shamash
25, the Qohelet passage highlights the uselessness of the charmer after the snake
bites. In the Jeremiah passage, it is Yahweh himself who will send uncharmable
snakes. 1
In much the same way as Shamash 25, biblical Psalms frequently contain
petitions followed by vows of praise. For example, Ps 7 begins with an invoca-
tion followed by a rather complex petition, including a lament, and ends with a
vow of praise. Other psalms ending with vows or vow-like elements include Pss
13, 14, 21, 22, 35, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 61, 69, 79 and 109.
Although šar šamê u erṣetim in line 1 may be echoed in Jdt 9:12, and later
theology clearly identified the Judean and Israelite monotheistic god with the
king of heaven and earth, surprisingly the Hebrew Bible does not contain a pre-
cise parallel to šar šamê u erṣetim, “king of heaven and earth.” 1 Chron 29:10–12
may well provide an extended paraphrase of the divine epithet. Zech 14:9 and
Dan 4:34 separately reflect the two halves of the epithet: Zech 14:9 proclaims
Yahweh, ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ל־ה‬
‫ל־כּ‬
‫ע‬ ַ ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫מ‬ ֶ , “king over all the earth,” and Dan 4:34 (in Aramaic)

Two incantations tablets treated by Finkel, “Incantations,” 223–29, may provide closer parallels
to Jer 8:17b than does Shamash 25 (See CBS 7005:13 and IM 5192:2, cited in note 4 above). On
snakes that cannot be conjured, see also the Sumerian Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld
version A, lines 42, 85, 129, and 140 (ur 2 -bi-a muš tu 6 nu-zu-a-e gud 3 im-ma-ni-ib-us 2 , “At its
roots, a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest.” [ETCSL trans.]).𒌋𒌋𒐼 A N AMBURBI AGAINST THE E VIL OF A S NAKE : S HAMASH 25

has Nebuchadnezzar acknowledge Yahweh as ‫א‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫מ‬,
“king of the heavens.” 2
For the more general juxtaposition of “heavens” and “earth” in BH and Akkadian
prayers, see page 379.
1 Sam 15:27 attests BH’s semantic equivalent of sissiktaka aṣbat: ‫ק‬ ֵ‫ז‬ ‫ח‬ ֲ ַ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬
‫ע‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫קּ‬ ָ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫יֹלו‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫ף־מ‬
ַ‫נ‬ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫בּ‬,
“and he [i.e., Saul] took hold of the hem of his [i.e., Samuel’s]
cloak and it tore.” (Old Aramaic, ‫בכנף‬ ‫אחז‬, and Ugaritic, ʿḫd bsin, also reflect the
expression.) To take hold of the hem is an act of both submission and allegiance.
Tearing the hem implies rejection. 3

Most MSS of Jdt 9:12 read δέσποτα τῶν οὐρανῶν καὶ τῆς γῆς but Codex Alexandrinus reads βασιλευς.
The larger context of Judith is Assyrian hegemony but it is hard to know the extent to which, if
at all, the passage echoes the Akkadian divine epithet. G. Brooke Lester noted this possible paral-
lel in a private communication. Of interest in this regard is Ps 103:19 where Yahweh is said to
have “established His throne in heaven and His sovereign rule is over all” (JPS).
3
On the tearing of a hem in an Akkadian prayer, see page 184, line 8 and related discussion
there. Tawil, “Hebrew ‫ד‬ ‫י‬ ַ ‫ץ‬ ‫פ‬ ֵ ַ‫נ‬,” 79–82 argues that ‫יד‬ ‫נפץ‬ in Dan 12:7, reflecting Akkadian qāta
napāṣu, “to thrust away the hand,” also has this negative connotation.

Dingirshadibbas to Personal Deities
A LAN L ENZI
T HE P ERSONAL G OD / G ODDESS :
Personal deities, both gods and goddesses, were generally minor deities in
the Mesopotamian pantheon that, as the name implies, had special significance
to an individual (henceforth, the protégé). 1 The personal deities were the creator
(bānû) and protector (nāṣiru) of the protégé. They cared (rāʾimu) for the protégé,
sustained their well-being (balāṭu), secured and maintained their social position
(via a šumu damqu, “a good name”), and generally granted the protégé success in
their varied endeavors, both personal and professional (ila rašû, “to obtain a
god” means “to have success, good fortune,” see CAD R, 194). In many respects,
the personal god was a kind of projection of the protégé’s parents onto the di-
vine sphere. Given the function and importance of the personal gods, people
owed them reverence and respect (ila palāḫu, “to fear the god,” and ila karābu,
“to bless the god, to greet the god in an honored manner” 2 ). If the individual did
something wrong, the personal deity could become angry and abandon the pro-
tégé. Or, if the protégé was experiencing difficulties of some kind, they might
believe these to be the result of the personal god’s anger and abandonment. In
any case, the anger and/or abandonment of the personal god left the protégé
without protection, open to further hardships or afflictions. The protégé would
therefore pray to the deity directly (as in dingirshadibba-prayers) or ask another
deity to intercede on their behalf (as in many shuilla-prayers) in order to soothe
the god’s anger and renew amicable fellowship.
Although personal deities had a special relationship to individuals, they
were not conceived in strictly individualistic terms like present-day imaginings
of guardian angels. Rather, the veneration of the personal god always took place
in a familial or communal context. In many respects, the personal god is more
like a family god. As such, the personal god could act as a witness to legal set-
tlements and an enforcer in family disputes or problems. The choice of one’s
1
This section is especially indebted to van der Toorn’s work, which is the best treatment of the
personal god currently available.
2
For more on this ritual act, which is more complicated than the English word conveys, see van
der Toorn, 113 and the general introduction, page 30.
431432personal god—or rather the god’s identity since there was little choice normal-
ly—was typically restricted to the personal deity of one’s parents. This is evi-
denced at times by the same theophoric element in personal names from genera-
tion to generation within a family. But the selection of a personal deity may also
have been contingent upon other factors: local (e.g., a nearby temple or shrine)
or occupational (e.g., many scribes took Nabu or Nisaba as their personal deity).
A woman, upon marriage, would give up revering the god of her father (ili abīša)
for that of her husband (ili bēlīša), showing again the familial association of the
personal god.
Although personal gods were usually minor or tertiary deities within the
Mesopotamian pantheon (e.g., Ninshubur, Ishtar’s vizier, was a common person-
al god, whereas Ishtar herself is never attested as a personal god nor is Anu),
there are exceptions. For example, Enlil, one of the chief gods of the pantheon,
on occasion took the role of an individual’s personal god. It seems, however, that
this practice was generally limited to kings.
T HE P RAYER :
This treatment includes two brief examples of dingirshadibba-prayers. In
fact, the division of the Akkadian text into two rather than three incantation-
prayers is not unanimous among the textual witnesses. The issue revolves
around the division of the material in lines 18–31 of this treatment. Some MSS in
Lambert’s edition preserve a rule line between our lines 21 and 22, suggesting
lines 18–21 and lines 22–31 be counted as two prayers instead of one. (Thus, the
material treated here would contain three prayers: 1–17, 18–21, and 22–31.)
Two MSS leave this ruling out and therefore see the material in lines 18–31 as
one prayer. (Thus, we have two prayers in the material treated here: 1–17 and
18–31.) Lambert’s MS K rearranges the material we identify as lines 18–31 as if it
were dealing with two blocks of text, two prayers: our lines 22–31 occur before
lines 18–21 on the tablet and a rule line separates the two textual blocks. In an-
other vein of support for dividing lines 18–31 into two prayers, Lambert’s MS B
includes (a broken) ÉN (šiptu) at the head of line 22, indicating the start of a new
incantation. But this is ambiguous evidence since MS B skips line 32 (the rubric)
and continues uninterrupted into what the other textual witness to this material
considers a separate prayer (i.e., Lambert’s MS K has a ruling after its placement
of our line 21, indicating a break before the next incantation-prayer on the tab-
let [not included here]). This textual diversity should come as no surprise to
anyone working with incantation-prayers. As a matter of convenience, the pre-
sent treatment follows previous translators in treating the following thirty-one
lines of Akkadian as two prayers.
The first prayer begins with a brief invocation of the personal god and a
statement of the supplicant’s ignorance of the severity of the god’s punishment
(note the predicative verb, dannat). The supplicant’s ignorance, commonly found
in penitential contexts, is a theme throughout the first half of the prayer. In the
next five lines the supplicant confesses their sins using mostly Gtn preterites or G𒌋𒌋 𒐊 D INGIRSHADIBBAS TO P ERSONAL D EITIES
433
perfects—the forms are ambiguous. This confession culminates in line 7, which
summarizes the supplicant’s sins (using a predicative verb, mādū) and reiterates
their ignorance, though this time the ignorance refers to what they actually did.
Line 7 recalls the first line of the prayer in its use of a predicative and its reprise
of the supplicant’s ignorance. Lines 8–10 contain the first wave of petitions.
These are directed only to the personal god (not the goddess) and are centered
on forgiveness of sins. Lines 11–12 are another confession of sorts but not of sin.
Rather, in words that recall line 1 (again) the supplicant confesses in line 11, or
rather professes, to understanding and having experienced (amāru) the severity
(note the predicative, dannat) of the god’s punishment (šēretka). This, they assert
in line 12, makes them a model from which other sinners should learn (amāru).
Having made this profession, the supplicant renews their attempts in lines 13–16
to reconcile with their deities via a series of petitions. The first two petitions are
directed separately to each of the personal deities, one to the god and one (the
first in the prayer) to the goddess (line 13). The remaining petitions are ad-
dressed to both deities (lines 14–16). The prayer concludes with a long and em-
phatic promise of praise (line 17).
The second prayer begins with an invocation that is rather long for a ding-
irshadibba-prayer. Five different phrases over two lines (18–19) invoke the dei-
ty. All of these epithets are related to the supplicant in a personal manner, which
is quite unlike the epithets in the hymnic introduction to shuilla-prayers. Follow-
ing this invocation are two formulaic petitions addressed to the personal god
and goddess, respectively. Since only the god was invoked in lines 18–19 and
the remainder of the text is addressed to him alone (note the 2ms pronominal
suffixes), this couplet creates a disjunction in the text. Lines 22–23 describe hu-
man ignorance, both generally and the supplicant’s particularly, with regard to
the divine abode in preparation for the prayer’s only expression of lament in line
24. Without the divine presence, the supplicant complains in line 24, they are
helpless. The prayer concludes with a series of petitions in lines 25–31 (and a
ritual meal in line 26). In these lines the supplicant tries to convince the god to
relent from his anger and restore the supplicant’s life (balāṭu, see lines 28, 30,
31)—long life, according to line 31. The first four lines of this block (lines 25–
28) sequentially mention four parts of the god’s body associated with the head
(i.e., neck, face, lips, and mouth). The last of these is the means for carrying out
the supplicant’s requests in lines 27b, 28b, and 30 (note the verbs: qabû twice
and šâmu). Unlike the previous example, this prayer does not conclude with a
promise of praise.
As Lambert has noted, both of these dingirshadibba-prayers are known to
have been used in specific ritual complexes. KAR 90, rev. 4 cites the incipit of
our first prayer (among eight other cited incipits) in the course of the ritual it
calls “my god I did not know” (nēpeši ilī ul īde, 269), and both prayers’ incipits
are cited in the first tablet of the ritual series Bīt rimki (in Zimmern, BBR, no. 26

portant.” Qalliš, “lightly, slightly,” seems in this context to denote a lack of respect for the
deity invoked, which brings the traditional language of the Decalogue to mind: “in vain.”
Zakāru, “to speak, to name, to invoke,” with nīšu, “to swear an oath” (lit. “to invoke the
life [nīšu] of” a deity, king, or someone). The 2ms pronominal suffix in our line replaces
the expected ili, “god,” because the supplicant is addressing the one on whom they have
sworn. See CAD Z, 19–20 for the idiom. The verb may look like an N stem (azzakkar), but
a passive would not make sense in this context. Rather, the verb can be either a G perfect
(azzakar) or Gtn preterite (azzakkar; see also lines 3a, 4, and 5 but note the simple preter-
ite in line 3b). One’s decision about these verbs will affect one’s translation and under-𒌋𒌋 𒐊 D INGIRSHADIBBAS TO P ERSONAL D EITIES

standing of the nature of the supplicant’s sin. (Previous translations vary. See, e.g., Foster,
722, who reads perfects throughout, and Seux, 203, who reads a perfect in line 2 but Gtn
preterites in lines 3–5.) The –zz– is a result of the assimilation of the infixed –t– to the
sibiliant (z) first radical of the root. The line is a stock phrase found elsewhere (Lambert,
294). See, e.g., line 87 in Lambert’s edition of the dingirshadibba-prayers (278) and Ludlul
II 22.
nīška kabtu qalliš azzakkar
Line 3: Mû, “divine decree, cultic ordinance, cosmic rule,” comes from the Sumerian
word me (see Gertrud Farber-Flügge, Der Mythos “Inanna und Enki” unter besonderer
Berücksichtigung der Liste der m e . [Studi Pohl 10; Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1973],
116–64). Mêšu, “to disregard, to neglect” (see CAD M/2, 41–42 for other examples of this
verb with reference to the gods). Magal, “(very) much, exceedingly,” also appears in lines
5 and 6. CAD M/1, 31 notes that this word, when it is used in SB Akkadian, typically oc-
curs several times in the context. Alāku, “to go.” Given the other verbs in context (and
depending on one’s decision about them), one might expect a perfect here rather than the
preterite. A Gtn form of the verb would not make sense in this context, “I walked about all
the time” (see CAD M/1, 29 for attestations). The last half of the line seems to be a meta-
phorical restatement of the first. (For another use of magal with alāku in the dingirshadib-
ba-prayers, see Lambert, 280, line 127: magal allak.)
mêka amtēš magal allik
Line 4: Šipru, “task, work, product, mission, message, action, affliction.” The context
does not allow an easy decision about this word’s precise meaning here. Danna/ātu has a
spectrum of meanings in the semantic domain of “hard, difficult.” Meanings range through
“difficulty, distress, famine,” “fortified place,” “foundation,” “binding (agreement),” and
“strict or harsh (words),” among other, more technical meanings (see CAD D, 87–91 and
CDA, 56). The meaning of the last word in the line, certainly a 1cs verb, is unclear. AHw,
1208, s.v. šeʾēru suggests the verb might be a denominative from šeʾru, “pock-marked.” But
this suggestion does not provide a sensible translation in our context. CAD Š/2, 259 does
not give a meaning, but it may be significant for other interpretive decisions in our context
that the one unbroken attestation of the verb occurs in the Gtn stem. Foster guesses the
verb means “I skirted” (722). Without a clear meaning for the verb, it is difficult to know
how to translate the other two, rather general terms in the line. My translation therefore
must be considered very tentative. In any case, given the surrounding lines, we may as-
sume the line conveys a negative act committed by the supplicant.
šipirka ina dannati ašteʾʾer
Line 5: Itû, “boundary, border.” Etēqu, “to cross over, to pass through.” Idiomatically,
itâ etēqu means “to trespass, to transgress.”

2–5). But no likely restorations have been suggested.
ul īdē-ma magal an[. . .
Line 7: Mâdu, “to be(come) many, to be(come) numerous.” The form is a 3mp predic-
ative. Arnu, “guilt, fault, sin.” Ēma, usually means “wherever,” but in our context it seems
to mean “what.” Epēšu, “to do.” The 1cs verb ēpušu ends with the subjunctive –u because it
is in a relative clause (starting with ēma). The verb īde is formally a preterite but context
must determine its tense. (There is no durative form.)
mādū arnūya ēma ēpušu ul īde
Line 8: The petition section of the prayer begins with the repetition of the invocation
(ilī, “my god”) and a series of imperatives. Pasāsu, “to cancel, to annul.” We expect a ms
impv. here (as with the following two verbs); thus, pusus. Three MSS inexplicably read the
fs impv., pussī, instead. The two MSS , however, that we are following, add the ventive to a
ms impv.: pussa. Paṭāru, “to loosen, to undo, to release.” Pašāru, “to loosen, to undo, to
release.” Both pašāru and paṭāru (less often pasāsu) are used in contexts dealing with the
forgiveness of sins or the release from sickness/demonic oppression (CAD P, 219, 237–39,
290–92). Kiṣru is literally a “knot, bond, lump,” but it is often used with libbu as a meta-
phor for anger. Libbu is literally the “heart,” but it also means “seat of emotions and/or
volition.” The anger of the deity must be assuaged before the supplicant can ask for any-
thing further (see lines 9 and 10).
ilī pussa puṭur pušur kiṣir libbīka
Line 9: The supplicant asks the deity here to mêšu their sins just as the supplicant had
done with the deity’s ordinances in line 3. Gillatu, “sin, sacrilege.” Leqû, “to take, to re-
ceive.” Unnīnu, “prayer, petition.” This line encapsulates the desires of the supplicant in
terms of negative and positive acts: the deity’s forgetting (–) of the supplicants past acts (–)
and the deity’s acceptance (+) of the present plea (+).
mēša gillātīya liqe unnīnīya
Line 10: Šakānu, “to place, to set, to put.” With ana the verb means “to turn X (the
verb’s object) into (ana) Y.” Ḫīṭu, “error, sin, crime.” Damqu, “good, favor, virtue.” The
supplicant now asks for the past sins to be transformed into virtues, rather than simply
disregarded, as in line 9.

Line 11: The text harks back to the opening line of the prayer with the words dannat
and šēretka. But now the words are distributed across the two halves of the line rather than
placed together, as in line 1. ŠU = qātu, “hand;” ŠU . II indicates both hands (see lines 12
and 14). Amāru, “to see,” but can also mean “to experience.”
dannat qātka ātamar šēretka
Line 12: Palāḫu, “to fear, to reverence.” d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” “God and goddess,”
as one might suppose, often appear together in Akkadian prayers and rituals and can be
treated as one grammatical unit. Pāliḫ is bound to both genitives. The idiom ina qātīya
amāru, literally, “to see in or by my hands,” means “to learn from.” The volitional form of
the verb changes to a precative since a third party (not the deity) is in view. The idea con-
tained in this line is also expressed in Ludlul III, line p.
lā pāliḫ ilīšu u ištarīšu ina qātīya līmur
Line 13: The supplicant calls on the god (see also lines 1 and 8) and the goddess (here
for the first time). They direct a nearly synonymous petition in the form of a command
(impv.) at each one individually. Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace, to be(come) reconciled.”
Our text follows Lambert’s MS A here (si-lim). Napšarī is an N-stem fs impv. from pašāru
(see line 8).
ilī silim ištarī napširī
Line 14: The supplicant now addresses the personal deities as a unit, again with an
impv. Tēnīnu, “prayer, supplication” (see CAD T, 343), is better than CDA’s “weeping,
lamentation” (404). Nīšu, “lifting,” is to be distinguished from the homonym in line 2.
Here we see the up-lifted hands as a gesture for prayer. Suḫḫuru (D of saḫāru), “to turn
(away, toward).” Pānu, “face.” One might experiment with more idiomatic renderings of
the line. What does it mean to ask someone to turn their face toward a person in a time of
need?
ana tēnīn nīš qātīya suḫḫirā pānīkunu
Line 15: Aggu, “Furious.” The adjective precedes the noun that it modifies, libbu. This
is not unusual in Akkadian poetic texts. Nâḫu, “to be at rest, to calm down, to relent.” The
verb is 3fp. The subject, libbakunu, is grammatically singular but must be taken as a collec-
tive, as the 2mp pronominal suffix suggests. See likewise kabattakunu in line 16. Lambert’s
MS K reads libbaka (note the 2ms suffix) in the first half of the line and then adds ištaru
zenītu silmī ( SILIM -me) ittīya, “O angry goddess, be at peace with me”; see line 21 below.

Line 16: The N-stem of pašāru is also used in line 13. Kabattu, literally, “liver,” often
has the sense of “mood, temperament,” especially in a context that also attests libbu. SILIM
= salīmu, “peace, reconciliation, favor.” For šakānu, see line 10. Here the verb must mean
something like “order, grant.” Lines 15 and 16a utilize the precative, as they express wish-
es about the deities’ moods and attitudes. Line 16b returns to the dominating imperative
(see lines 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14).
lippašrā kabattakunu salīmu šuknāni
Line 17: Ša lā, “without.” Mašû, “to forget.” Dalīlū, “praises.” Šitammuru (Gtn of
šamāru), “to praise, to extol (constantly ?).” See CAD Š/1, 297–98 for the slippage between
the Gt and Gtn forms. UN . MEŠ = nišū (f), “people, populace.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu
(f), “wide.” On an interesting twist to the common “promise of praise” formula at the end
of many Akkadian prayers, our text explicitly mentions not forgetting to fulfill the promise
and indicates that the praise will be public.
ša lā mašê dalīlīkunu luštammar ana nišī rapšāti
Line 18: The second incantation ( ÉN ) begins here. Bēlu, “lord.” Banû, “to build, cre-
ate.” MU = šumu, “name.” “To create someone’s name” means to engender them, to give
them existence. A prescriptive grammatical approach to the text might lead us to expect
bāni šumīya; that is, we might expect the participle to be bound to the genitive and not in
the nominative case. See likewise the second half of line 19. In SB Akkadian, however, a
participle from a III-weak root in construct with a following substantive often ends with –û
(see Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der jungbabylonischen „hym-
nischen“ Literatur, 2 Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 14/1–2; Stuttgart: Franz
Steiner Verlag, 1987], 1.95). The first two lines of this prayer begin with five epithets of
the personal god—more than usual for dingirshadibba-prayers. Each epithet directly and
personally relates to the supplicant. Compare the shuilla-prayers, where the epithets tend
to relate to the deity’s position within the pantheon or to the deity’s temple.
šiptu: ilī bēlī bānû šumīya
Line 19: Naṣāru, “to guard, to watch.” Napištu, “life.” Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to cause to
be, to create.” Mušabšû is a participle, parallel with the epithet at the beginning of the line
(nāṣir). NUMUN = zēru, “seed, progeny.” This prayer shows just how closely šumu
(“name”), napištu (“life”), and zēru (“seed”) were associated in ancient Mesopotamia.

Line 20: See line 15 above. In the prayer’s first petitions (lines 20 and 21), the suppli-
cant’s personal deities—god as well as goddess, in contrast to the prayer’s invocation in
lines 18 and 19—are invoked (again).

Line 21: Zenû (m), zenītu (f), “angry.” KI = itti, “with.”
ištaru zenītu silmī ittīya
Line 22: Mannu, “who.” Šubtu, “dwelling, seat.” In some MSS a new prayer starts with
this line, indicated by the rule line that comes before it (lacking in two MSS ). Though lack-
ing in the majority of the MSS , ÉN is partially present in one MS . See the introduction to the
prayer above. The (reprised) invocation is a simple vocative, ilī, “my god.” The question is
rhetorical, intended indirectly to place the supplicant within general human ignorance of
divine things.
mannu īde ilī šubatka
Line 23: Mazzāzu (manzāzu), “position, abode, location.” Ellu, “clear, clean, (ritually)
pure,” sometimes translated “holy.” Kummu, “cella, shrine, innermost room.” Matīma, “at
any time, ever, never.” Amrāku is an active stative (or, a “transitive parsāku construction,”
in Huehnergard’s grammar) from amāru (see line 11). Manzāzu and kummu further define
the more general term šubtu in line 22. Now the supplicant directly admits personal igno-
rance of the divine abode. Lines 22 and 23 move from the general to the particular in
terms of both the location of the deity and those ignorant of it. Both lines begin with the
same syllable, which binds the two together phonologically.
manzāzka ellu kummaka matīma ul amrāku
Line 24: Kīma ginâ, “constantly, always.” Šuʾduru (Š of adāru), “to cause annoyance,
to frighten;” the verb is used to convey something about mood or state of mind, such as
fright, despondency, or gloominess (see CAD A/1, 105). In contrast to the sublime divine
abode, the supplicant is in utter misery. Mêš, “where?” The final question in this line is not
so much rhetorical (as in line 1) as petitioning. But the supplicant is not actually interested
in where the deity has gone, of course; rather, the supplicant really wants to know why the
god is not nearby.

Line 25: Turru (D of târu), “to turn (a part of the body),” see CAD T, 273–75; with
kišādu, “neck,” as object, the verb means “to turn back, to relent” (see 275, with other
examples). The –a on the end of the imperative form is the ventive. Šabāsu, “to be angry,”
also has kišādu, the referent of the relative ša, as object (see CAD Š/1, 5), in which case the
idiom means “to turn away in anger.” UGU = eli, “against, on, upon.” The line, therefore,
means literally, “turn back your neck which you turned away in anger against me.” Like
the one preceding it, this line is both a description of the sufferer’s plight as well as a peti-
tion to change it, though the latter is foregrounded.
terra kišādka ša tašbusu elīya
Line 26: Suḫḫuru, (D of saḫāru), see line 14. Used with pānu, the verb can denote a
positive or negative action (see CAD S, 49–50). The ventive on the verb confirms what the
context requires, a turning toward. In parallel with line 25, the supplicant petitions the
deity for favor using the language of turning. KÙ = ellu (see line 23). The adjective again
precedes the noun that it modifies (see also line 15). Mākālû, “meal, food,” with reference
to a deity (note the genitive ili, which may be translated as an adjective here, “divine”)
means “offering.” Ulû šamni, “the best oil” (see AHw, 1411 and CDA, 421 s.v. ulû), is in
apposition to mākālê ili and defines the items presented in the offering. Here the text of the
prayer gives us a window onto the ritual action that accompanied it: the setting out of an
offering of choice oil.
suḫḫira pānīka ana elli mākālê ili ulû šamni
Line 27: Šaptā, “lips” (nom. dual). Ṭūbu, “goodness,” is the object of the transitive
verb maḫāru, “to receive.” Qabû, “to speak, to command.” Ešēru, “to be straight, to go
well, to be well, to prosper.” The first part of the line describes the result of the suppli-
cant’s petition for the deity to turn toward the offering in line 26: so he may receive it. The
end of the line, paralleling the syntax of imperative + precative of the previous two
phrases, shows what the supplicant wants (expects ?) in exchange for the offering: they
want a divine decree that will result in prosperity.
šaptāka ṭūba limḫurā qibī-ma lūšir
Line 28: Pû, “mouth.” TI . LA = balāṭu, “life, health, well-being.” The petition for a
divine decree (qibi) is repeated, though this time with a more direct request (imperative +
object rather than imperative + precative): the supplicant wants life. The deity’s mouth
becomes the instrument of action rather than the beneficiary of the supplicant’s offering
(i.e., the deity’s lips received the offering in line 27).

Line 29: Á = idu, “side, arm, strength.” Literally, ina idu means “on the side of,” but it
functions as a preposition meaning “from” and need not be translated literally (see CAD
I/J, 14). MUNUS . ḪUL = lemuttu, “wickedness, evil.” Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to make X pass
by.” N of eṭēru, “to be rescued, to be saved.” The reading of the two verbs adopted here
comes from Lambert’s MS B (see 277, n.51). Itti, “with.” What does it mean to be rescued
“with” the deity? The deity’s renewed attention and presence will give protection to the
supplicant as they escape the evil that has beset them (see CAD E, 403, which explains the
preposition with “i.e., protected by”). The syntagm imperative + precative (as result)
returns in this line. The ina phrase at the head of our line grammatically parallels the one
in line 28 (ina + body part + modifier); semantically, however, the two are quite distinct.
The deity’s mouth was an instrument of salvation; the evil power is that from which the
supplicant needs saving.
ina idi lemutti šūtiqannī-ma lunneṭir ittīka
Line 30: Šâmu, “to decree, to appoint, to ordain.” Šīmtu, “fate, destiny.” The first two
words form a cognate accusative. Like line 28, the supplicant asks for life or health
(balāṭu). Here, however, the use of šâmu and its cognate šīmtu seems more emphatic.
šīmannī-ma šīmat balāṭi
Line 31: UD . MEŠ = umū, “days.” Urruku (D of arāku), “to lengthen.” Qâšu, “to give, to
grant.” The first phrase helps us understand the full meaning of balāṭu in this and the pre-
ceding lines. The supplicant is not only asking for health but also an extension of their
days. The prayer’s petitions are firmly rooted in the mortal life of the supplicant. They
wish that life to be longer.
ūmīya urrika balāṭa qīša
Line 32: The scribe inadvertently omitted the RU sign. This line is the rubric, that is,
it tells something about the classification of the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric
identifies the kind of prayers on the tablet. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian.
It may be translated, “it is the wording for appeasing the angry heart of a god.”
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Before delving into a broader comparative point about the prayer’s form, I
first note a few parallels between the language of our Akkadian prayer and what
is found in the Hebrew Bible. First, the use of the phrase itâ etēqu in the sense of
“to trespass, to transgress” in line 5 is similar to the semantic range of the BH
root ‫עבר‬. I discuss this parallel on page 308. The phrase nāṣir napištīya, “the one
who guards my life,” in line 19 finds an etymological equivalent in BH ‫שׁ‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ֶ‫נ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫ֹצ‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ .
In Prov 24:12 we read about the deity as ‫ָך‬ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫פ‬ ְ ַ‫נ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫ֹצ‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ , “the one who guards your442life” (see Tawil, ALCBH, 244). Finally, in the second line of our prayer the sup-
plicant confesses “I repeatedly swore a solemn oath on your life in vain (lit.,
lightly)” (nīška kabtu qalliš azzakkar). Semantically, this is very close to the
Decalogue’s commandment about pronouncing (literally, lifting [‫)]נשׂא‬ 1 the di-
vine name ‫א‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ל‬,
“in a worthless or groundless manner, in vain” (Exod 20:7, Deut
5:11). 2 Although the biblical text does not explicitly mention swearing, the idi-
om “to lift a name” may have originally been its equivalent or, rather, a broader
action that subsumed it. In any case, earliest interpretations seem to have identi-
fied the commandment with a prohibition on swearing falsely. 3 These similari-
ties in language once again suggest the conceptual proximity of Mesopotamian
and ancient Israelite religious worldviews.
Shuilla-prayers typically begin with a long hymnic introduction, which, as
argued in the general introduction, is part of the formal greeting appropriate for
addressing a high god in the pantheon. We have seen how this formal greeting is
also reflected in some of the prayers of the Hebrew Bible on page 238. In con-
trast to shuillas, the dingirshadibba-prayers attest very brief invocations, some-
times as brief as one word, “my god” (ilī, see line 1). When epithets are used,
they are few and always reflect the personal nature of the relationship between
the personal god and the supplicant (see, e.g., lines 18–19). As I have argued
elsewhere, 4 one need not formally address one’s personal god in a dingirsha-
dibba as one would a high god in a shuilla because one is already on intimate,
informal terms with the personal deity. This same mode of brief and informal
address may be seen in the Psalter’s laments of the individual (3; 5; 6; 7; 13; 17;
22; 25; 26; 27:7–14; 28; 31; 35; 38; 39; 42; 43; 51; 54; 55; 56; 57; 59; 61; 63;
64; 69; 70; 71; 86; 88; 102; 109; 120; 130; 140; 141; 142; and 143). 5 In most
laments of the individual the invocation is simply ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ , “O Yahweh” (see, e.g.,
Pss 3:2 and 6:2), or ‫ים‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O God” (see, e.g., 43:1 and 51:3 in the Elohistic Psal-
ter). Other invocations are just as short, consisting of a single word (Ps 59:2,
‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O my god”), or only slightly longer with brief invocations in parallelism
with one another in the opening verse or two (see Pss 28:1, ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫צוּ‬ / ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ , “O Yah-
weh / my rock”; 70:2, ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ / ‫ים‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O God / O Yahweh”; 25:1–2, ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ / ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ , “O
1
The BH use of ‫נשׂא‬ in the phrase ‫ם‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֵ ‫נשׂא‬, “to pronounce a name,” is similar to the Akkadian use
of the cognate verb našû in the phrase šipta/šuʾillakka našû, “to recite an incantation/a shuilla”
(see Tawil, ALCBH, 249–50 and CAD N/2, 108–9). An even closer equivalent to the Akkadian
phrase is BH’s ‫ה‬ ‫לּ‬ ָ ‫פ‬ ִ ‫תּ‬ ְ ‫נשׂא‬ in, e.g., 2 Kgs 19:4.

See HALOT, 1425–26. The word was not originally equivalent to “falsely,” though it was even-
tually understood in that way. See the next note.

invocations consist of only three words: Ps 5:2–3, which places ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ in parallel
with ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫אֹל‬ ֵ‫ו‬ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ , “my king and my god”; Ps 22:2–3, showing ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ , “my god, my
god,” in parallel with ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O my god”; and Ps 88:2 and its questionable formu-

ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ֵ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬, “O Yahweh, god of my salvation.” 6 In light of the similar
mode of address between the dingirshadibba-prayers and the laments of the in-
dividual and in light of what others have suggested about the familial Sitz im
Leben and personal content of the biblical laments of the individual, 7 it seems
reasonable to understand the Israelite deity addressed in these psalms as occupy-
ing a role akin to the Mesopotamian personal god.

An Ershaḫunga to Any God
C HARLES H ALTON
T HE D EITY A DDRESSED :
Unlike other prayers from Mesopotamia this prayer is not addressed to a
specific, named deity. This suggests the petitioner did not know which god or
goddess they had offended, so they went to great lengths to frame the supplica-
tion in an inclusive manner. For instance, almost every plea is repeated in order
to include both genders, and the petitioner even included supplications to ac-
count for an unknown deity. Although the petitioner did not direct their prayer
to a specific deity, the prayer was nonetheless intended for the particular god or
goddess that was offended. Early translations of this prayer, such as in ANET,
titled it “Prayer to Every God,” as if the plea was directed at every deity. How-
ever, as Morton Smith rightly observes,
The composition entitled “Prayer to Every God” should have been entitled “Prayer to
Any God”—it is not addressed “to all gods in general,” [Smith refers to the introduc-
tion to this prayer in ANET], but to that one god or goddess whom the petitioner sup-
poses to be punishing him or her and it is significant that the petitioner takes it for
granted that this unknown deity is singular. 1
Since Smith’s critique, most editors have adopted the interpretation and title he
suggested.
T HE P RAYER :
The colophon of this text identifies it as an ershaḫunga-prayer, “lament for
appeasing the heart (of a deity).” 2 Generally, these prayers do not include a spe-
cific request such as relief from a disease or demon; instead, they seek reconcili-
ation with an angry deity. Furthermore, ershaḫunga-prayers avoid mentioning
particular sins or transgressions as the petitioner recounts a more generic confes-
sion.
A full picture of the rituals associated with the ershaḫunga-prayers is not
available, but a few details are known. In contrast to balags, ershemas and Su-

447448merian shuilla-prayers, ershaḫunga-prayers were never sung (zamāru). Rather,
the ershaḫunga-prayers were made (epēšu), spoken (dabābu), recited (manû), and
lifted up (našû). 3 Even though ershaḫunga-prayers were not sung, kettledrums
often accompanied their recitation. Furthermore, ershaḫunga-prayers were recit-
ed along with other forms of laments and prayers during rituals such as for a
substitute king. 4 (See page 43 in the general introduction for more about er-
shaḫunga-prayers.)
Originally, the present prayer was composed in Sumerian, but at some point
most lines were furnished with an interlinear Akkadian translation, which will
be the focus of this treatment. A handful of lines or parts of lines were left un-
translated, but this primarily occurs in sentences that repeat something or con-
tain only a minor change from the previous line that was translated (such as
shifting the gender of the subject). In these cases, the scribe apparently assumed
the translation would be self-evident. I have filled in these assumed translations
with an approximated Akkadian text and placed them inside {braces}. The last
seven lines of the prayer appear only in Sumerian and do not follow the above
rationale. They are not analyzed in this treatment. 5
The prayer begins with what Maul has labeled the “type C” introductory lit-
any in which the supplicant seeks with a series of precatives to move the deity to
act on their behalf. 6 The first line of the prayer is one of the few petitions within
the bilingual section that is not repeated to a female deity. It should be seen as
an introductory statement summarizing the request that the deity be reconciled
to the petitioner. Lines 2–10 repeat the plea that the deity’s anger subside so
that the relationship may return to status quo and by implication alleviate what-
ever hardship the petitioner is suffering. Although lines 11–16 are broken, the
lament section of the prayer probably starts here and continues through line 38.
Based on the scant clues that remain in lines 11–16, the supplicant seems to
mention their sin and something related to a favorable name, a common Meso-
potamian concern. 7 In lines 17–20 the petitioner confesses deep anguish and
remorse concerning the sins that they committed in ignorance. They confess that

It may be interpretively significant that the end of the prayer consists of seven lines of untrans-
lated Sumerian since the number seven is central to the petitioner’s plea within this section:
My god, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
My goddess, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
Whichever god, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
Whichever goddess, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
Forgive my sins, let me sing your praise.
As if you were my mother, let your heart be reconciled to me.
As if you were my mother or my father, let your heart be reconciled to me.

Foster, following Falkenstein (226), reasonably suggests lines 11–12 are a confession of igno-
rance of sin and lines 13–16 are a lament that neither god nor goddess called or pronounced the
supplicant’s name with favor (763).

their sins were many and great in lines 21–25. This confession is followed with a
series of four statements that assert the petitioner’s ignorance of the offence (26–
29). In line 30 the supplicant begins a description of the woes that have lead up
to the current plight. The supplicant starts with the initial anger of the deity
(lines 30–32) and then moves on to the bodily consequences of this anger (lines
33–34): the supplicant became sick. Lines 35–37 recount the supplicant’s at-
tempts to seek aid. But the futility of these attempts has left them in the current
condition of misery (line 38). Lines 39–46 are identified by Maul as a transition
between the lament and the petition section proper. 8 In these lines the suppli-
cant describes their current actions in turning to the deity for help. 9 Lines 47–55
comprise the petition section proper. A series of “how long” questions (lines 47–
50) are followed by the petitioner again reiterating their ignorance in commit-
ting the offence (lines 51–53). The petition section culminates with two final,
self-referential pleas (line 54–55). The last three lines of Akkadian (lines 56–58)
and the first four of the final seven lines in Sumerian (see n. 5 above) replace the
typical intercessory litany often found in ershaḫunga-prayers with a litany for
the removal of sin. 10 The fifth line of Sumerian transitions, with its mention of
praise, into the two-line conclusion formula (Maul’s Schlußformel), 11 which is the
final structural feature of an ershaḫunga-prayer.

Line 1: The ša indicates possession (see libbīšu). Bēlu, “lord.” Nuggat, “wrath, anger,”
related to the verb agāgu, “to be angry” (see CAD A/1, 139–40), is in construct with ŠÀ =
libbu, “heart.” (See the commentary on this line in Maul, 244 for the reading ug ! .) The 3ms
pronominal suffix on libbu is resumptive, referring back to ša bēlim, “that of the lord.” The
phrase ana ašrīšu litūra literally means “may it return to its place.” Idiomatically, the
phrase means “to return to normal” (see CAD T, 255), which in this case means the suppli-4502. i-lum ša la i-du-ú {ana aš-ri-šú li-tu-ra}

cant wants the anger of the deity to subside and the deity’s disposition toward the peti-
tioner to return to status quo. Litūra is the precative form of the verb târu “to return,” with
a ventive suffix. The “anger” of a god is only mentioned in line 1 (in fact, the only time it
is the subject of the refrain’s verb, litūra). Lines 2–10 each simply identify a deity (or a
deity’s heart, as in lines 6–7). We should probably assume that these deities are also con-
sidered angry (see the next note and the restoration in lines 9–10). As indicated in the
introduction, line 1 is distinguished from the following lines, which are all paired to incor-
porate both genders. It provides a summary of the intent of the prayer: to placate the
god(dess).
ša bēlim nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 2: Ilum, “god.” Ša marks a relative clause. Lā is a negative particle used in sub-
ordinate clauses, questions, and prohibitions while ul is used in independent declarative
sentences. Edû (idû), “to know.” The form is a 1cs preterite, īde, with a subjunctive = īdû.
The petitioner begins the prayer by addressing the god and goddess that they do not know,
indicating their ignorance of the offence committed. Since the petitioner does not know
how or whom they offended, they must “cover the bases” and make sure to include every
possible deity. While the scribe left the second half of lines 2–7 and probably 9–10 blank,
ana ašrīšu/ašrīša litūra is implied (see line 8). The gender (and number) of the pronominal
suffix on ašru will vary according to the grammatical gender of the deity/item named in
subsequent lines.
ilum ša lā īdû ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 3: Ishtar, the goddess of love and war, was a major deity during the Neo-
Assyrian empire (see Tzvi Abusch, “Ishtar,” DDD, 452–56 and Black and Green, 108–9).
However, in this text ištar is used generically to indicate a “goddess.” This line begins a
typical construction seen in this prayer in which consecutive lines repeat the phrase with a
divine subject of the opposite gender.
ištar ša lā īdû ana ašrīša litūra
Line 4: Idû lā idû is rendered “known or unknown, i.e., whatever” according to CAD
I/J, 29b. Notice the assonance in the first half of the phrase as well as the fact that three of
the first four words contain two syllables providing a quickly moving rhythm.
ilum idû lā idû ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 5: There is no Akkadian translation of the Sumerian line, ama- d innin ì-zu nu-un-
zu ki-bi-šè; however, the assumed translation is easily provided since the only difference
between lines 4 and 5 is the shift in subject: from “god” to “goddess.”

Line 6: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” The sign IA marks the 1cs suffix and is a combination of
the I and A signs but is commonly normalized as ya (MesZL, #260). This line recalls the
petition in the first line; however, the pronouns have switched from third to first person
(though, the Sumerian version contains the 3ms suffix as seen in line 1). In lines 6 and 7
the petitioner addresses their own personal god/goddess.
libbi ilīya ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 7: As in line 5, there is no Akkadian translation of the Sumerian line, šà-ama-
innin-mu ki-bi-šè. The provided translation into Akkadian is based on the previous line.
libbi ištarīya ana ašrīšu litūra
d
Line 8: Litūrū is a 3mp precative form of târu, “to return.” Masculine plural nouns are
used to indicate mixed gender plurals as well as strictly male plurals. This line is unique in
that both genders are mentioned within the same line.
ilum u ištar ana ašrīšunu litūrū
Line 9: The reconstruction is based on line 32. Isbusu is a 3cs preterite from šabāsu
(sabāsu), “to be(come) angry” (see CAD Š/1, 4b–5a); the –u suffix is the subjunctive, mark-
ing this as the verb of the clause beginning with ša. This line is similar to the previous
lines; however, a verb marks the divine anger explicitly, assuming a correct reconstruction.
ilum ša elīya isbusu ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 10: This line is fragmentary, but presumably it is identical to the previous except
for the change of subject: from “god” to “goddess.”
ištar ša elīya isbusu ana ašrīša litūra
Line 17: The noun, akal (akalu), “bread, food,” is in the construct state and introduces
the relative clause that follows; this syntactical unit forms the object of the line’s main
verb (akālu). Uttû is a 3cs durative verb (with a subjunctive suffix) from (w)atû, “to find, to
be present.” Ramānīya is formed from the noun ramānu, “self,” with a 1cs suffix, yielding
“myself.” Ul negates (see the note on line 2) ākul which is the 1cs preterite form of akālu,
“to eat.” The petitioner tells the deity that they did not eat the food and drink “by them-
selves,” i.e., they did not neglect to invite the deity to be present and share the meal with
them (Maul, 245). This line marks the beginning of a new strophe. The subject changes45218. me-e ut-tu-[u ina ra-ma-ni-ia ul] áš-ti

rance in the hopes that the deity will show them mercy (19–20), and finally, admits that
their sins are many (21–25).
akal uttû ina ramānīya ul ākul
Line 18: Mû, “water.” Mê is the construct form. Šatû, “to drink.” The construction, mê
uttû, is similar to the first phrase of line 17, akal uttû. Like the previous line the petitioner
says that they invited the deity to be present and share in the meal.
mê uttû ina ramānīya ul ašti
Line 19: Ikkibu, “abomination, taboo.” See the note on line 17 for a discussion of the
construct form’s function here. CAD (I/J, 57) notes that the idiom formed with the verb
akālu, “to eat,” must not always be translated literally; however, this usage might be an
instance of wordplay. The two previous lines describe acts of eating and drinking while
lines 19 and 20 depict transgression in a more abstract manner. Line 19 links lines 20 and
21 with lines 17 and 18 and indicates that this section refers to the same event. The sup-
plicant admits guilt, which indicates a deterministic and retributive perspective regarding
evil and suffering. The petitioner believes that they “reap what they sow.” In other words,
since they are suffering they assume that they committed an offense of some kind. Howev-
er, they do not know for which sin they are suffering. Notice the assonance throughout
this line, which heightens the emotional impact.
ikkib ilīya ina lā idê ākul
Line 20: The use of anzil (construct of anzillu), “abomination, taboo, boundary” and
ukabbis (1cs preterite of kubbusu [D of kabāsu], “to tread”) is semantically equivalent to the
idiom in line 19. The supplicant again rephrases the same plea in order to get the god’s
attention and to make sure that every potentially offended deity is addressed.
anzil ištarīya ina lā idê ukabbis
Line 21: Annu (arnu), “guilt, misdeed.” Mâdu, “to be(come) much, many.” Rabû, “to
be(come) great.” Maʾdā (see CAD M/1, 24) and rabâ are both 3fp predicatives. (Compare
the attributive use of the feminine plural form of mādu [maʾdu] in line 58 with the predica-
tive used here.) Ḫiṭītu, “error, crime, sin”; the plural is ḫiṭâtu. This line is the first to men-
tion the quantity and severity of the petitioner’s offence. In addition to recognizing trans-
gression, the supplicant confesses the grave nature of it. Likely, since the sufferer is in
extreme discomfort (see lines 32–33) they assume that their transgression was proportion-
ally offensive to the deity.

Line 22: As in lines 5 and 7, lines 22–25 do not have an Akkadian translation. They
essentially repeat the lament of line 21, except the vocative there, bēlum, is replaced by the
supplicant’s personal god and goddess in lines 22–23 and “whichever” god and goddess in
lines 24–25.

Line 23: This line is identical to the previous one except for the change in gender for

Line 26: Epēšu, “to do.” This form is a 1cs preterite with a subjunctive suffix. Lines
26–29 are similar in structure: the line begins with a noun in the construct state that in-
troduces a relative clause and is then followed by a 1cs preterite verb ending with a sub-
junctive suffix (see line 17). This syntactical construction forms the object of the main verb
(edû). Each line ends with ul īde, “I do not know.” The petitioner lists different synonyms
for “crime, sin, and taboo” in order to underscore the fact that they are completely igno-
rant of their offence.
anni ēpušu ul īde
Line 27: Ḫīṭu, “error, sin.” Compare this with the form in line 56. Ḫaṭû, “to commit an
error, crime, sin.” Aḫṭû is a 1cs preterite with a subjunctive suffix. The second half of this
line is supplied from the previous line according to the pattern of repeating a similar idea
with different terminology.

Line 30: Uggat is the construct form of uggatu, “rage, fury.” Nekelmû, “to glower, to
frown, to regard malevolently.” The preterite form here, ikkelmânni, has a ventive and 1cs
suffix (as do all the final verbs in lines 30–33). Lines 30–34 attribute the supplicant’s afflic-
tion to divine anger. This section begins merely stating that the deity is angry (30–31)
while lines 32–34 describe the supplicant’s condition as “sick” (marṣu), “burning” (ṣarāpu),
and “afflicted” (ašuštu), respectively.
bēlum ina uggat libbīšu ikkelmânni
Line 31: Uzzu, “anger.” Šumḫuru (Š of maḫāru), “to cause to confront.” The petitioner
presents their suffering as a product of divine confrontation. This line includes yet another
synonym for divine anger. In light of the nominative, bēlum, that begins line 30 we could
interpret i-lì as a so-called nominative absolute therefore translating this line as, “My
god—he had made me confront the anger of his heart.” However, the Sumerian, dingir
šag 4 šur 2 -ra-bi, speaks against this interpretation.
ili ina uzzi libbīšu ušamḫiranni
Line 32: Isbus-ma bears the enclitic –ma, “and,” which is used to join the line’s two
clauses together. Marṣiš (based on marṣu, “sick”) has the terminative-adverbial ending –iš
but is not to be confused with the adverb marṣiš, “bitterly.” Šūmû (Š of emû [ewûm]), when
used with –iš, means “to turn, change into” (see CAD E, 415). The deity’s anger is not
merely causing external duress but is even affecting the petitioner’s health.
ištar elīya isbus-ma marṣiš ušēmânni
Line 33: The beginning of lines 33–34 were left blank by the scribe. The translation
was apparently assumed. The assumed Akkadian translation is based on the Sumerian:
dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-zu. Ṣurrupu (D of ṣarāpu), “to burn.” Foster translates this verb idio-
matically (“excoriated me”) but ṣarāpu can also indicate physical pain such as a burning
sensation in the intestines and/or epigastrium (CAD Ṣ, 103). This reading fits better with
the previous line that says a goddess made the petitioner sick.

Line 34: The assumed Akkadian translation is based on the Sumerian: ama- d innin ì-zu
nu-un-zu. Ašuštu, “affliction, grief.” Iškuna is a 3cs preterite of šakānu with a ventive. This
line concludes the section that attributes the supplicant’s affliction to the unknown deity.
The nominative form, ašuštu, is an example of the fact that in Standard Babylonian the
nominative case ending often occurs where we expect an accusative.
ištar idû lā idû ašuštu iškuna
Line 35: Aštaneʾʾê-ma is a Gtn durative of šeʾû, “to seek out,” with an enclitic –ma. As
the supplicant is still lamenting their situation, the duratives in lines 35 and 37 should be
understood as referring to habitual action in the past. Mamman, “someone, somebody.”
The phrase qāta ṣabātu, lit. “to seize the hand,” is an idiom meaning “to help,” but it can
also mean “to lead” and possibly both connotations are meant here. The petitioner is alone
and without help because no one—not even a human much less a god—would guide them
as they searched for answers (see CAD Ṣ, 30–32). In lines 35–37 the supplicant claims that
no one responded to their cries for help. The laments build until line 38, where the peti-
tioner concludes the lament section of the prayer by describing their present state of mis-
ery.
aštaneʾʾê-ma mamman qātī ul iṣabbat
Line 36: Bakû, “to cry.” Itâtēya is the plural of itû, “boundary, environs,” with a 1cs
pronoun. Iṭḫû is a 3mp preterite of ṭeḫû, “to approach.” Not only would no one give the
petitioner guidance but they would not even come near them.
abkī-ma itâtēya ul iṭḫû
Line 37: Qubû, “lament.” Qabû, “to speak.” Šemû, “to hear.” This lament extends the
idea of the previous line—no one cared about the supplicant enough to listen to their suf-
fering let alone attempt to help them.
qubê aqabbi mamman ul išemmânni
Line 38: Uššušu, “distress, worry.” Katmu literally means “hidden,” but in the context
of this prayer the petitioner likely means that their plight is hidden from the gods; i.e.,
they are alone in their troubles with no one to help. In concert with the previous two lines,
this phrase could indicate the fact that other humans have abandoned them as well. The
–āku endings on the two substantives indicate the 1cs predicative. Naṭālu, “to see.”

Line 39: Rēmēnû, “merciful.” Attanasḫar is a Ntn durative of saḫāru, “to search con-
stantly.” Unnīnu, “prayer, petition.” To speak (qabû) a prayer or petition (unnīnu) to a di-
vine being is to implore them. The description of the god as “merciful” contains an implied
request that the deity act in accordance with this characteristic. Lines 39–46 comprise a
transition section between the lament and the petition section in which the supplicant
turns to the deity for help. The duratives should now be translated as referring to the pre-
sent.
ana ilīya rēmēnî attanasḫar unnīni aqabbi
Line 40: Šēpā is a dual form of šēpu, “foot.” Nuššuqu (D of našāqu), “to kiss.” The res-
toration in the middle of the line is suggested by the Sumerian mu-un-su-ub-su-ub; see
Maul, 239, 245 and Langdon, 42. Aptanaššil is a Gtn from pašālu, “to crawl.” The repeated
use of š heightens the emotional thrust of this line and possibly imitates a crawling sound.
The pronominal suffix on šēpāša is redundant with the ša at the head of the line.
ša ištarīya šēpāša unaššaq ina maḫrīki aptanaššil
Line 41: Nasḫuru (N of saḫāru), “to return, to show favorable attention, to repent.”
After an initial ana, the first half of line 41 is blank (an assumed translation) and most of
the rest of the line is broken. The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first
half of the line: dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-[zu . . .] (see likewise lines 42 and 44–46). The sec-
ond halves of lines 41–46 take their cue from Langdon’s conjectural restorations (42).
These are reasonable but quite uncertain. If the reconstruction is accurate, the supplicant
tries to get the deity’s attention with the use of direct imperatives here and in the next
several lines in order that the deity might pay attention to the supplicant’s plight.
ana ili idû lā idû nasḫiranni unnīni aqabbi
Line 42: Presumably, this line follows the pattern of repeating the previous plea with
a goddess as the subject. The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation: ama- d innin ì-zu
[nu-un-zu . . .].
ana ištar idû lā idû nasḫiranni unnīni aqabbi
Line 43: Lines 43 and 44 address a particular deity whereas lines 41–42 and 45–46
are addressed to “whichever god/goddess.” The Akkadian reconstruction of this line fol-
lows Langdon’s conjecture tentatively (42), but see Maul’s reservations, particularly con-
cerning the reading of the GUR sign (239, 246). Even if the reading of the GUR sign is
valid, it is doubtful that the Akkadian analogue would be saḫāru since there is only one𒌋𒐋 A N E RSHAHUNGA TO A NY G OD

Line 44: The Sumerian suggests the assumed Akkadian translation for this line: ama-

perative with a 1cs suffix.

ištar idû lā idû naplisīnni unnīni aqabbi
Line 47: The phrase adi mati is composed of two particles: adi, “until,” and mati,
“when.” The phrase is typically rendered, “how long (until)?” With line 47 the prayer
begins the petition section (lines 47–55). After attempting to get the deity’s attention (lines
41–46), the petitioner now asks a series of “how long . . .” questions (lines 47–55).
adi mati ilī libbaka . . .
Line 48: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line:
me-en-na ama- d innin-mu. The second half is partially restored conjecturally by Maul (240).
Kabattu, “innards, liver, mind, mood,” is frequently found in parallelism with libbu (see
line 47). Lipšaḫa is a 3cs precative of pašāḫu, “to cool down, rest, abate,” with a ventive
suffix.
adi mati ištarī kabattaki . . . lipšaḫa
Line 49: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line:
me-en-na dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-zu. Linūḫ is a 3cs precative of nâhu, “to calm down, to
relent.”

Line 50: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line:
me-en-na ama- d innin ì-zu nu-un-zu. Ahû, “foreign, different” (to be differentiated from aḫu,
which means, “side, arm”). In this line ahû describes the disposition of a goddess’s heart
that is not in its normal condition, i.e., it is estranged from the petitioner. This final ques-
tion in the series recalls the beginning of the prayer with the plea that the fury of the dei-
ty’s heart subside (see line 1: nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra); however, in line 50 the peti-
tioner asks that the deity’s estranged heart might be reconciled (libbīšu aḫû ana ašrīšu litūr).
adi mati ištar idû lā idû libbīki aḫû ana ašrīšu litūr
Line 51: Amēlūtu (amīlūtu, awīlūtum), “humanity.” Sukkuku, “deaf, mentally handi-
capped,” is a 3fs predicative here. Mimma, “anything, something.” This line begins a sec-
tion in the petition (lines 51–55) in which the supplicant reiterates their ignorance in
committing the offence. They stress the finite nature of humanity—in comparison to the
gods, humans are deaf and unknowing. The supplicant implies that the deity should take
the human condition into consideration and provide them mercy.
amēlūtu sukkukat-ma mimma ul īde
Line 52: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation of the line’s first word: nam-
lú-u 18 -lu. Mal(a), “all, as many as.” Mala / ša šuma nabû, is an idiom for “everything, eve-
ryone” (see CAD N/1, 35 for other examples with amēlūtu). Mīnu, “what?” The supplicant
has gone out of the way to describe the deity in multiple ways to include every contingen-
cy. In like manner, the supplicant says that no matter how humanity is described or what
terms are used for them, the results are the same—humans lack knowledge.
amēlūtu mal šumu nabû mīnu īde
Line 53: Gullulu (D), “to sin, to do wrong.” Dummuqu (D of damāqu), “to do good, to
make pleasant.” The syntagm, Lū . . . lū means, “either/whether . . . or” (CDA, 184 and
CAD L, 226–27). Not only should humanity not be held responsible for misdeeds due to
ignorance, similarly, good deeds are not meritorious.
lū ugallil lū udammiq mimma ul īde
Line 54: ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.” Sakāpu, “to repulse, to turn away” (see CAD
S, 73). Lines 54–55 present an emotionally compelling plea. The petitioner imagines them-
selves as stuck in a swamp and unable to extricate themselves—they must rely upon exter-
nal help. Therefore, the supplicant puts their well-being into the hands of the deity. For
the aradka-style and change of person from first to third, see Maul, 19.

Line 55: Rušumtu, “swamp.” Qassu is formed from the noun qātu, “hand,” and a 3ms
suffix. Nadi is a predicative from nadû, “to throw down, lay down.” See line 35 for the
idiom qāssu ṣabat.
ina mê rušumti nadi qāssu ṣabat
Line 56: Ḫiṭṭu = ḫīṭu, “error, sin.” For ḫaṭû, see line 27. Tēr is an imperative from
turru (D of târu), which means “to turn something into something else” when used with
ana (this text exhibits occasional Assyrianisms such as ēpuš and accordingly this word
could be read as ti 7 -ir > tīr). As mentioned in the introduction to the prayer, the last three
lines of Akkadian (lines 56–58) and the first four of the final seven lines in Sumerian (see
footnote 5 above) replace the typical intercessory litany often found in ershaḫunga-prayers
with a litany for the removal of sin. The fifth line of Sumerian transitions with its mention
of praise into the two-line conclusion formula (Maul’s Schlußformel), the final structural
feature of an ershaḫunga-prayer.
ḫiṭṭi aḫṭû ana damiqti tēr
Line 57: For annu, see line 21. Šāru, “wind.” We expect a subjunctive on the verb
ēpuš, as in the previous line, but it is lacking. Litbal is a precative from tabālu, “to carry off,
to take away,” a verb closely related to (w)abālu. In the last two lines the petitioner asks
that the sins they have repeatedly acknowledged throughout this prayer be carried away in
the wind and stripped off of their body. Misdeeds are not merely actions that disappear
with time but they are pictured as objects that stick to the offender.
anna ēpuš šāru litbal
Line 58: Gillatu, “sin, sacrilege,” is the object of the verb despite the nominative case
ending. Ṣubātu, “textile, garment.” Kīma, “as, like.” Šaḫātu, “to strip off, to cast off.”
gillātūya maʾdāti kīma ṣubāti šuḫuṭ
Rubric: The rubric is in Sumerian. It may be translated: “An ershaḫunga of sixty-five
lines to any god.” The rest of the tablet contains the colophon, stating that this tablet was
faithfully copied at Ashurbanipal’s palace.460C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
There are many constructions in the Prayer to Any God that have semantic
or lexical analogues to BH. The phrase in line 1, nuggat libbīšu, “anger of his
heart,” is semantically similar to several expressions in BH; however, instead of
using a bound phrase, Hebrew normally uses verbs with ‫ב‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ to indicate anger. 1
For example, Prov 19:3: “a man’s folly subverts his path and his heart rages
against Yahweh ( ‫בּוֹ‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫ף‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ְ‫ז‬ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ל־‬ ‫ע‬ ַ )”; Ezek 32:9: “I will provoke the heart (‫י‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬
‫ב‬ ‫)ל‬
of many peoples when I bring (news) of your defeat among the nations”; and
Deut 19:6: “lest the redeemer lynch the killer when his heart burns (‫בוֹ‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ם‬ ‫ֵח‬ ַ ‫י‬ ).”
There are also a few lexical analogues. A BH analogue to the word sukkuku,
“deaf, mentally handicapped” (line 51), appears once albeit in a verbal form in
Deut 27:9: ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫וּשׁ‬
‫ת‬ ‫כּ‬ ֵ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ה‬,
“Silence! Listen, Israel!” 2
This prayer contains many sentiments that are similar to those found in bib-
lical prayers. For example, when Job brings his case against Yahweh he com-
mands, “take your hand and forearm far away from me—stop terrorizing me!”
(13:21). Although Job is more forceful and blunt than the petitioner of our Ak-
kadian prayer, both prayers share the view that the offended deity is bringing
trouble upon the supplicants. Job also asks Yahweh, “why are you hiding your
face from me and regarding me as your enemy?” (13:24). This question parallels
lines 35–39 of this prayer in which the petitioner says that they kept seeking
help but no one came to their aid. However, there are differences between Job
and Prayer to Any God. In contrast to Prayer to Any God, Job does not admit
guilt. In fact, Job maintains his innocence and challenges Yahweh to make his
offenses known (13:23).
Psalm 51 contains a humble confession of sin that is similar to the tone of
our prayer; however, the psalmist knows his offense (‫ע‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫)פ‬
and he is con-
tinually aware of his sin ( ‫יד‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫דּ‬ ִ ְ‫ג‬ ֶ‫נ‬ ‫י‬ ‫את‬
‫טּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ; v. 5), whereas our petitioner commit-
ted their offense in ignorance and they do not know what they did that offended
the deity (lines 19–20). The psalmist also implores God, “wash away my vice
and cleanse me from my sin” (‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ֲ ‫ט‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫את‬
‫טּ‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫וּמ‬
‫י‬ ִ‫וֹנ‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ס‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫;כּ‬
v. 4), which parallels
lines 57–58 of Prayer to Any God. Lastly, Psalm 40:3 recounts a time when God
pulled the psalmist out of a pit of destruction (‫אוֹן‬ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫)בּוֹר‬ and the miry mud ( ‫יט‬ ‫ט‬ ִ
‫ן‬ ֵ‫ו‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫)ה‬,
which is similar to the imagery in line 55 where the supplicant is stranded
in swamp water (mê rušumti).
Finally, the anguish seen in Lamentations 1:16, 20–21 parallels that in
Prayer to Any God. In Lamentations 1:20 the lamenter describes his grief in
terms of distress (‫ר‬ ‫)צ‬,
a burning belly (‫רוּ‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫ח‬ ֳ ‫י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫;מ‬
this is similar to the imagery
1
Tawil (ALCBH, 182, §37) translates the bound phrase ‫ז‬ ‫גּ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ in Deut 28:65 as “a raging heart”
under the gloss “furious, raging.” He links this with the Akkadian phrase libbu aggu/ezzu. How-
ever, ‫ז‬ ‫גּ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ַ merely means “agitated quivering” and the context indicates that the phrase should be
rendered “fluttering heart,” referring to fear or anxiety instead of anger.

the deity’s attention by underscoring the petitioner’s contrition. Furthermore,
the lamenter echoes the cry of Prayer to Any God in lines 35–38 in that no one
is present to give comfort (Lam 1:16, 21).

A Tamitu to Shamash and Adad
A LAN L ENZI
S HAMASH AND A DAD :
See pages 197 and 85.
T HE P RAYER :
Tamitu-prayers are essentially long yes-or-no questions posed to the gods of
extispicy, Shamash and Adad. The answer was received via extispicy. As de-
scribed in the general introduction, after the invariable invocation and epithets
(see our line 1), tamitus are quite varied in their content but show a number of
common structural features, all or several of which may appear in any given
tamitu-prayer. Our prayer includes a formal presentation of the person for whom
the diviner is making the inquiry (lines 3–5a)—a guard responsible for a particu-
lar section of the city’s fields; an attempt to persuade the deities to respond via
flattery (line 5b); a stipulated term during which the inquiry was applicable
(lines 6–7); the question (lines 8–21), about which we will say more below; and
one technical qualification in the form of an ezib-clause (line 22). The prayer
does not include one of the endings identified in Lambert’s structural outline
(14).
The question comprises the majority of the text. It may be divided into three
parts, the last two of which are marked by a re-introduction of the person for
whom the diviner is inquiring (see lines 13 and 20). The first part (lines 8–12)
describes the potential preparations and attack of an enemy army. The second
(lines 13–18) describes what the enemy may potentially harm among that which
the concerned person is guarding. And the third part (lines 19–21) describes
how the person for whom the diviner is inquiring might be affected by the ene-
my’s potential actions.
The main MS used in Lambert’s edition of this prayer, ND 5492 (= IM
67692), was a compendium tablet that contained six tamitus. Its colophon indi-
cates that this tablet was Tablet VII of the Nimrud series of tamitus. Its copyist
was an exorcist, not a diviner, as one might expect.

Line 1: The diviner opens with an invocation to the gods of extispicy. d UTU = Šamaš,
the sun god, god of justice. EN = bēlu, “lord.” Dīnu, “decision, judgment.” d IŠKUR = Adad, a
storm god. For Adad’s role in divination, see page 86. Bīru, “divination” (both the act of
extispicy and the answer received). The epithets bēl dīnim and bēl bīri are typical for Sha-
mash and Adad when they are invoked for divinatory purposes. See the OB ikribu-like
prayer on page 85 and the ikribu-prayers generally (see Zimmern, BBR, nos. 75–101 [pp.
190–219]).
Šamaš bēl dīnim Adad bēl bīri
Line 2: Ša, a relative pronoun (“who, which”), refers to both Shamash and Adad as
the object of the first verb, thus “whom.” Šâlu, “to ask.” The verb is a 1cs durative with a
2mp dative pronominal suffix. The pronominal suffix is resumptive. As the verb indicates,
the body of the text should be understood in an interrogatory mode. Annu, “consent, ap-
proval, ‘yes’.” Kīnu, “firm, reliable, true.” These last two words belong with the following
imperative; they describe the kind of answer the diviner is requesting the gods give him.
ša ašallūkunūši anna kīna
Line 3: Apālu, “to answer, to reply.” The verb is a cp impv. with a 1cs accusative
pronominal suffix. The phrase in lines 2–3b is only attested here on the Nimrud MS that
preserves this tamitu. The other five tamitus in this Nimrud compendium move directly
into the identification of the person for whom the diviner is inquiring or into the stipulat-
ed term. SÍG can be read as both šīpātu, “wool,” or šārtu, “hair.” TÚG . SÍG = sissiktu, “hem,
fringe.” Lambert argues that the phrase SÍG u TÚG . SÍG may have originally been understood
as “hair and fringe,” offering OB and MB parallels for support; but such an understanding,
he notes, leaves the ms annû, “this,” unexplained since we expect a fs, annītu. Thus, he
suggests that although the phrase originally meant “hair and fringe” it was misunderstood
in the MB period, when scribes read the first SÍG as šipātu, “wool,” and took the phrase as a
hendiadys: “wool and fringe” = “woolen fringe” (see Lambert, 15–17). In any case, the
item(s) referred to by the phrase is to be understood conceptually as a metonymic substi-𒌋𒌋𒐌 A T AMITU TO S HAMASH AND A DAD

tute for its owner. Lines 3–5 introduce this owner, for whom the diviner is making the
divinatory inquiry, as one on guard duty in the fields, which were outside the city walls.
aplāʾinni bēl šipāti u sissikti annû
Line 4: TA = ištu, “from.” A . ŠÀ = eqlu, “field.” NENNI = annanna, “so-and-so.” Usually
used as a placeholder for the supplicant’s name, in this case annanna stands for the par-
ticular field being guarded by the person introduced in line 3. EN = adi, “until, as far as.”
ša ištu eqli annanna adi eqli annanna
Line 5: EN . NUN = maṣṣartu, “watch.” Naṣāru, “to guard, to watch, to protect.” The
verb is 3cs durative. The –u on the end is the subjunctive (due to the ša in line 4). The verb
and its object require an idiomatic rather than literal translation. DINGIR -ut-ku-nu =
ilūtkunu, “your divinity.” GAL -tum = rabītum (fs), “great.” In a parenthetical expression in
the second half of this line and the first word of the next the diviner flatters the gods’ su-
perior knowledge.
maṣṣarta inaṣṣaru ilūtkunu rabītum
Line 6: ZU = edû (idû), “to know.” The form īdû, although formally preterite, has no
tense. One must provide it from context. Ūmu, “day.” NE = annû, “this.” Idiomatically, ūme
annî means “today.” The day of the actual inquiry marks the start of the inquiry’s stipulat-
ed term (often called adannu in Akk., see line 22), that is, the time period during which
the divinatory action is applicable. The duration is indicated in the next line. DÙ -ti =
nēpeštu, “activity, procedure, ritual performance.” Bārûtu, “divination.” The diviner speci-
fies how he will discover the answer to his inquiry.
īdû ištu ūme annî nēpešti bārûti
Line 7: UD . 30 . KÁM = the 30 th day of the month. ITI = arḫu (warḫum), “month.” The
stipulated term is less than a month (see also line 22). UD . NÁ . A = bibbulu (bubbulu), “the
day of the disappearance of the moon.” A lunar month is usually 28 or 29 days. The day of
the moon’s disappearance would mark the end of the previous month and the beginning of
the next.

Line 8: ÉRIN = ummānu, “army, troops.” KÚR = nakru, “foreign, strange; enemy” In its
substantival usage, as here, nakru refers to enemies. Mala, “as many as, as much as.” Bašû,
“to be, to exist.” The form is predicative. Mala bašû means “as many as there are.” Qallu
(m), qallatu (f), “small, light.” As applied to an army, perhaps “light forces” (see CAD Q,
62). This line introduces the concern about which the diviner is inquiring for the person
introduced in lines 3–5. Ummān nakri is the subject of the verbs that follow in lines 9–20.468

Some of the verbs are 3cs and others are 3mp. Lines 8–12 describe the potential prepara-
tions and attack of the enemy.
ummān nakri mala bašû ištu qallati
Line 9: Kabittu, “main body, main forces of the army.” Lā, “not.” The following four
verbs describe the preparations an enemy army might make before an attack, which is
finally mentioned in line 12. The verb uštagappašū and the two morphologically similar
verbs in line 10 are difficult. Although probably to be derived from the Št stem, none of
these verbs is attested in this stem outside of the present text. Tentatively, šutagappušu (Št
of gapāšu) is understood here to mean “to cause oneself to be enlarged, swelled”(?). The
form is a 3mp durative, utilizing the long form of the durative typical of the Št lexical
(likewise with the verbs in line 10).
adi kabitti lā uštagappašū
Line 10: Šutapaḫḫuru (Št of paḫāru), “to cause oneself to be gathered in force”(?) (al-
ternatively, see CAD P, 32, whose analysis leaves the infixed –ta– unexplained). Šutadan-
nunu (Št of danānu), “to cause oneself to be strengthened”(?).
lā uštapaḫḫarū lā uštadannanū
Line 11: Rēṣu, “helper, ally” (see CAD R, 268–70). Tillatu, “reinforcement, support.”
= rašû, “to acquire, to gain.” Notice that the verb here and the one in the next line
are 3cs.
rēṣi u tillati lā iraššī-ma
TUKU
Line 12: Tību, “attack.” Šiḫṭu (šeḫṭu), “attack, raid.” Šakānu, “to put, to place,” but in
this context a more idiomatic rendering is required: “to make,” “to inflict,” etc. Notice the
ventive marker on the verb, indicating the action lies in the direction of the speaker.
tība šiḫṭa lā išakkanam-ma
Line 13: Ina usually means “in,” but “during” is contextually more appropriate. For
= maṣṣartu, see line 5. For the remainder of the line, see line 3. This line breaks
the rhythm of the previous few and begins a section (lines 13–18) that describes the possi-
ble results of the enemy’s attack. Notice that the person for whom the diviner is inquiring
is mentioned again here at a structural turning point in the inquiry.

Line 14: EDIN = ṣēru, “steppe, hinterland.” MÁŠ . ANŠE = būlu, “animals, livestock.” URU
= ālu, “city.” Šallatu, “booty.” The diviner inquires whether the enemy will inflict losses
(see lines 16–18 for the verbs) inside and outside of the city, that is, anywhere, so as to
affect the herds and the possessions of the person for whom the diviner is inquiring. Šallatu
is not limited to moveable property; it includes human captives or prisoners, too. This line
stands in parallel with line 15. Thus, the two specific nouns here stand in parallel to the
two that indicate generic quantity in line 15. All four nouns in the acc. case in lines 14–15,
būla, šallata, mīṣa, maʾda, comprise the grammatical objects of the verbs used in lines 16–
18.
ina ṣēri būla ina āli šallata
Line 15: The ina has the sense of “with respect to” here. Mīṣu (wīṣum, īṣu), “little,
few.” Maʾdu (mādu), “much, many, abundant, numerous.” The phrase ina mīṣi mīṣa ina
maʾdi maʾda (see the first word of the next line) specifies how much the enemy may take,
which depends on how much there is available for the taking. Lambert translates it, “little
where there is little, much where there is much” (33).
ina mīṣi mīṣa ina maʾdi
Line 16: The first word here belongs with the previous line. Lines 16–18 contain the
following syntagm: relative pronoun ša + inf. + durative verb, where the inf. and dura-
tive verb are from the same root. The ša plus inf. defines that which is potentially available
among the objects of the verbs to suffer from the action of the verbs, thus “they will not
kill livestock . . . booty . . . a little . . . a lot, which can be killed, will they?” This is the
meaning of Lambert’s “as appropriate” (33).

Line 19: This line begins the last section of the inquiry; it centers on the potential
aftermath of the enemy’s raid. Bussurtu, “news, report, tidings,” does not necessarily desig-
nate good news, though that is its most common use. It is often bound to other nouns, such47020. ana EN SÍG u TÚG .s ÍG an-ni-i la ú-pa-as-s[a-ru]

as ḫadû, “joy,” dumqu, “favor,” or lumnu, “evil,” to specify its meaning (see CAD B, 346–47
for attestations). The noun is fem. pl. here. MUNUS . Ḫ UL = lemuttu, “evil, wickedness.”
u bussurāti ša lemutti
Line 20: The person for whom the diviner is inquiring appears yet again at this struc-
tural junction, the start of the last section of the inquiry, as one who might receive bad
news resulting from the enemy’s violent actions. Ana, “to, for.” Bussuru (pussuru), “to de-
liver, to send, to receive news.” Although often used for good news, the verb does not
necessarily have this connotation (see CAD B, 347–48).
ana bēl šipāti u sissikti annî upassurū
Line 21: Libbu, “heart.” GIG = marāṣu, “to be(come) sick.” Lemēnu, “to be(come) bad,
to fall into bad times.” Both verbs, however, when used with libbu as subject can mean “to
be(come) angry, displeased” (see CAD M, 274 and L, 117). Lambert therefore renders the
verbs as “be distressed or distraught.” Since libbu must be the subject of the verbs, the final
u on both are superfluous, perhaps added by dint of the fact that the verbs in lines 16–18,
20 end with the 3mp –ū. The query concludes with the potential reaction of the person for
whom the query is being made. There is no praise offered or promised to the deities in-
voked.
libbašu lā imarraṣ(u) lā ilammen(u)
Line 22: The only ezib-clause reinforces the stipulated term, adannu (adānu), “time
limit, fixed time, deadline” (see lines 6–7). Ezib is a ms impv. from ezēbu; the impv. means
“leave aside, ignore, disregard.” Ana arkat (warkat; = EGIR ), “after.” Ēribu, “entering, in-
coming,” refers here to the coming month, the one after the stipulated term during which
the inquiry was applicable. Presumably the person for whom the diviner was inquiring was
on guard duty for one month and only interested in that period of time.
ezib ana arkat adanni ša arḫi ēribi
Line 23: This line is the rubric to the text. It is not part of the diviner’s prayer. Tamītu,
“inquiry, oracle-inquiry” (see page 49). SILIM = šulmu, “well-being, peace, safety.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The suggestions offered in the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night (see page
79) supply a broad comparative view on the issue of extispicy and divination
and are relevant to developing a comparative perspective on this prayer, too.
The suggestions made here will focus on two particular issues: the use of binary
oracles and the BH equivalent of the term bussurtu.𒌋𒌋𒐌 A T AMITU TO S HAMASH AND A DAD
471
Although the present prayer involved extispicy to discover the will of the
gods, the format of the entire operation was essentially binary: the gods an-
swered a query by selecting one or the other possible reply, positive or negative.
Biblical narratives occasionally exhibit a binary oracular method in use. 1 For
example, in 1 Sam 14:9–14 Jonathan and his armor bearer contrive an either-or
situation to determine how they should engage an enemy they have encoun-
tered. If the enemy answers one way, the two men will stay where they are; if
the other, they will take it as a sign that Yahweh has given them victory and will
go up to fight the enemy. A similar oracle is invented by Gideon in Judg 6:37–40
with the use of a fleece. These are ad hoc oracles used by individuals.
The best biblical parallel to the institutional system used in the tamitu-
prayers is the official oracular means of the Levitical high priest (Deut 33:8), the
biblical Urim and Thummim, which was kept in the high priest’s ephod (Exod
28:30; Lev 8:8) and used to give guidance to the leader of the people (Num
27:21). Its binary format is suggested by the manner in which people framed
questions when inquiring of Yahweh in narrative contexts that suggest the Urim
and Thummim’s use. See, for example, 1 Sam 23:9–12 and 30:8. Perhaps the
best evidence for how the Urim and Thummim worked comes from the Greek
rendering of 1 Sam 14:41, a context in which the MT has become garbled: εἰ ἐν
ἐμοὶ ἤ ἐν Ιωναθαν τῷ υἱῷ μου ἡ ἀδικία, κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ, δὸς δήλους · καὶ ἐὰν τάδε εἴπῃς
Ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου Ισραηλ, δὸς δὴ ὁσιότητα, “if the wrongdoing is in me or in Jonathan,
my son, O Yahweh, god of Israel, give Urim (lit., clear), but if you say, ‘(it is) in
your people Israel,’ give then Thummim (lit., holiness 2 ).’” Although not a yes-no
question, the framing of the question here suggests a binary opposition between
which the Urim and Thummim would be used to decide. 3 If we take the immedi-
ate context of this particular inquiry into consideration, it seems that the oracle
could sometimes be inconclusive (1 Sam 14:37; see also 1 Sam 28:6). The same
held true with Mesopotamian extispicy, which explains why we see the diviners
petition Shamash and Adad to give a sure reply (kittam šuknam) in the ikribu-
and associated prayers.
The Akk. term bussurtu, “news, report, tidings,” in line 19 is derived from
the same root as the verb bussuru (pussuru) in line 20. The BH cognates to these
are ‫ה‬ ‫ֹר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ‫בּ‬ ְ and ‫בּשׂר‬, the latter of which, like the Akk. verb, is found only in the D
or piel stem (see Tawil, ALCBH, 61–62). The BH terms are quite similar in mean-
ing to the Akk. words. Both BH words can be used to describe goods news with
or without further modification (see HALOT, 163–64). Compare, for example, 2
Sam 18:19, where the context of the verse provides the clue that the news is
1
I leave aside the practice of casting lots, which may or may not have been binary in nature.
See Anne Marie Kitz, “The Hebrew Terminology of Lot Casting and Its Ancient Near Eastern
Context,” CBQ 62 (2000), 207–14 for a recent summary of what we know about the practice
(reference courtesy of Jeffrey Cooley).

The translator has probably read ‫ים‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫תּ‬ ָ rather than ‫ים‬ ‫מּ‬ ִ ‫תּ‬ ֻ here.

See Moshe Greenberg, “Urim and Thummim,” EJ 2 20:422–23.472considered good ( ‫יו‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ְ‫אֹי‬ ‫יַּד‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫טוֹ‬ ‫פ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ך‬ ֶ‫ל‬ ‫מּ‬ ֶ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ה‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שּׂ‬ ְ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫א‬ ֲ ַ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ‫רוּצ‬
‫א‬ ָ , “let me run so I
can report to [‫ה‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שּׂ‬ ְ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫]א‬
the king that Yahweh has delivered him from the hand of
his enemies”), 4 with v. 27, where David explicitly assumes the news is good on
the basis of the messenger ( ‫בוֹא‬ ָ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ‫טוֹב‬
‫ה‬ ‫שׂוֹר‬
‫ל־בּ‬
‫א‬ ֶ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫ז‬ ‫ישׁ־טוֹב‬ ‫א‬ ִ ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫מּ‬ ֶ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫אמ‬
ֹ ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ , “the king
said, ‘he is a good man, he will bring good news’”). 5
Since good news is not inherent in the meaning of the words, one will also
find attestations of these words for the delivery of bad news (determined from
context). For example, upon hearing the news of Israel’s defeat, the capture of
the ark, and the death of his sons from a messenger (‫ר‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ֵ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫מ‬,
lit. “one who bears
news”) in 1 Sam 4:17–18, Eli falls backwards, breaks his neck, and dies! 6 Jer
20:15 exemplifies well how the speaker’s attitude toward that which was report-
ed shaped its reception as good or bad news. Jeremiah curses the man who
brought news (‫ר‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ַ ‫)בּ‬
of Jeremiah’s birth to his father (Jer 20:15). What was in-
tended to be good news to the father is presented in an entirely negative light by
the despairing Jeremiah. Likewise holds for the news of the death of Saul. Da-
vid’s response to the news was anger—even killing the messenger of the sup-
posed good tidings(!)—and lamentation (2 Sam 1:1–16, read with 2 Sam 4:10),
whereas the Philistines cut off Saul’s head and sent it with his armor throughout
the land to herald the news of his defeat (1 Sam 31:9  1 Chron 10:9; compare
this to David’s poetic lament in 2 Sam 1:20). This last act finds an interesting
parallel in a Neo-Assyrian caption-inscription found on a relief. After the defeat
of the Elamite king Teumann, the officers in the field sent the Elamite king’s
head to Ashurbanipal to inform him of the good news (ana bussurat ḫadê). 7
4
See also vv. 31–32. But note v. 20, where Joab seems to believe the news will not be welcomed
by its intended audience (David) and tries to keep the messenger from going. For other contexts
that use our words without ‫טוֹב‬ to describe good news (determined from context) or to announce
something positive, see, e.g., 2 Kgs 7:9, Isa 40:9, 60:6, 61:1, Nah 2:1 (compare with Isa 52:7),
Pss 40:10, 68:12–14, and 96:2 ( 1 Chron 16:23).
5
See similarly 1 Kgs 1:42.
6
See David’s reaction to the news of Absalom’s death in 2 Sam 18:32–19:1. Although not attest-
ing the words under discussion, Gen 37:31–35 and Job 1:13–21 also illustrate the severe impact
of unexpected bad news upon its hearers.

A NB Royal Prayer to Nabu
A LAN L ENZI
N ABU :
See page 325.
T HE P RAYER :
Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions typically conclude with a prayer, some-
times also called a blessing (Segenswunsch). The deity to whom the prayer is di-
rected is always chosen on the basis of the building project being commemorat-
ed in the inscription. In the present text Nabu is invoked by Nebuchadnezzar II
because the royal inscription commemorates his restoration of É-ur 5 -(me)-imin-
an-ki, “the house that gathers the seven (me’s) of heaven and earth,” the ziggu-
rat of Nabu’s E-zida temple in Borsippa. 1
The prayer is quite simple in structure. The first two lines contain an invo-
cation and four epithets. The remainder of the prayer consists of a series of peti-
tions (lines 3–16). Although several of the epithets in the opening two lines are
common, they seem to correspond rather closely with the petitions in the second
part of the prayer. The first and last of the four epithets, aplu kīnim, “true heir,”
and narām Marduk, “beloved of Marduk,” foreshadow Nebuchadnezzar’s petition
for Nabu to intercede with Marduk on his behalf (see lines 11–12). The second,
sukkallam ṣīri, “exalted vizier,” hints at Nabu’s role as divine scribe in the assem-
bly of the gods, mentioned in lines 8–10, and establishes him as one with official
access to commend the supplicant to Marduk (lines 13–16). The third epithet,
šitluṭu, “triumphant, pre-eminent one,” has martial overtones and connects to
Nebuchadnezzar’s request for dominance over his enemies in lines 6–7.
Lines 3–16 contain four petitions. The first petition, in lines 3–7, is the most
extensive. Based on his pious deeds (epšētūya, line 3), Nebuchadnezzar asks for
long life, a stable reign, and the defeat of his enemies as a gift (line 7). Lines 8–
10 repeat the request for long life but this time Nabu is asked to decree and in-
1

zations 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993), #1193.
475476scribe it on his true writing board (line 8). In a culture that knows well the pres-
tige and permanence of the written word, this request is more than a repetition
of the first petition. Nebuchadnezzar seems to be asking Nabu, the scribal god,
to put this particular gift “in writing,” that is, to make his long life official in the
heavenly accounts. In lines 11–13 Nebuchadnezzar asks Nabu to commend his
good deeds (epšētūya, which harks back to line 3) and decree his well-being be-
fore Marduk. As the high god’s son, Nabu would have had special access to the
figure head of the pantheon and would therefore have been a very powerful
intercessor. Lines 14–16, the final petition, provide the actual content, the spe-
cific words, Nabu is to speak while in Marduk’s presence: “Nebuchadnezzar is
indeed the king, the provider!”
Alongside the obvious theme of long life, one will note the predominance of
the written and spoken word throughout the prayer. As a king, Nebuchadnezzar
would have known very well the power of his own decree over his subjects and
the permanence of that which he put into writing. It seems this prayer is con-
structed on analogy to the king’s own power: it is hoped that a divine written
record and oral testimony would insure the fulfillment of the petitions.

Line 1: d Na-bi-um is an archaizing spelling for Nabû. After the invocation, the intro-
duction to the prayer consists of a string of epithets that hymn Nabu. IBILA = aplu, “son,
heir.” Kīnu, “true.” Here, the word denotes legitimacy, as in the “true heir.” Sukkallu (šuk-
kallu), “vizier, court official, minister.” Langdon’s edition omits the AL sign (see Norris I R
51, no. 1 ii 16). Ṣīru, “exalted, supreme, outstanding.” Case endings in NB Akkadian had
fallen out of use. The case endings as they appear in the text are basically irrelevant to
grammatical analysis.

Line 2: Šitluṭu, “triumphant, pre-eminent,” is an epithet used only for Nabu and Ni-
nurta (see CAD Š/3, 130). For the martial tone of the epithet, see the related verb, the Gt𒌋𒌋𒐍 A NB R OYAL P RAYER TO N ABU

Line 3: Epištu, “work.” Epšētūya is the direct object of the verb in the next line. Ana,
“to, for.” Damiqtu, “favor, goodwill.” Ana damiqti as a prepositional phrase works adverbi-
ally, expressing the manner in which the supplicant wishes the god to look (see line 4)
upon his works. “Favorably” is a good English equivalent. Ḫadîš, “joyfully, happily.” Nebu-
chadnezzar bases his first petition (lines 3–7) on his good deeds.

Line 4: Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to see, to look upon.”

Line 5: Balāṭu, “life.” Da-rí-a is a pseudologogram for dārû, “eternal, lasting” (see
Hanspeter Schaudig, Die Inschriften Nabonids von Babylon und Kyros’ des Großen samt den in
ihrem Umfeld enstandenen Tendenzschriften: Textausgabe und Grammatik [AOAT 256; Mün-
ster: Ugarit-Verlag, 2001], 103). Šebû, “to be full, to be replete, to be satisfied with.” The
inf. is in construct with the following noun (see the same syntagm in line 6). Littūtu, “ex-
treme old age.” Lines 5, 6, and half of 7 contain the direct object of the verb in line 7.

Line 6: Kūnu, “firmness.” GIŠ . GU . ZA = kussû, “throne, chair.” Labāru, “to be(come) old,
long-lasting.” Palû, “reign.” Labār palê means “long-lasting reign.” Šumqutu (Š of maqātu),
“to cause to fall, to cause someone’s downfall or ruin.” Nakru, nakiru means “strange, for-
eign,” but as a substantive, “enemy, foe.”

country.” MA . DA , rather than KUR , is used frequently in NB royal inscriptions for mātu.
Ayyābu, “enemy.” Širiktu (šeriktu), “gift, present.” Šarāku, “to give, to bestow.” The impera-
tive bears a 1cs dative suffix, showing who is to be given the gift (namely, the supplicant,
Nebuchadnezzar).

Line 8: Ina, “on, in.” GIŠ . LI . U 5 . UM = lēʾu, “writing board.” Writing boards were flat
boards made of wood, ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, or silver which were covered with wax.
(Only the first two materials are attested among discovered artifacts.) The scribe would
inscribe a text into the wax, which could then be erased by heating. For the discovery,
restoration (including Agatha Christie’s role), and description of the 32 examples found at
Nimrud, see Joan and David Oates, Nimrud: An Assyrian Imperial City Revealed (London:
British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2001), 97–99, 104 (fig. 62), and 219–20. Kunnu, “to
establish firmly, to define, to fix.” The participle modifies lēʾu. It is bound to the following
noun, pulukku, “boundary, limits.” As a scribal god, Nabu holds a writing board that has
power over the cosmos as well as individuals’ fates (see line 10).
ina lēʾīka mukīn puluk
Line 9: Šamû, “heavens.” U, “and.” Erṣetu, “earth.” In this common word pair, the
“earth” refers to the netherworld, forming a cosmic merism.
šamê u erṣetim
Line 10: Nabû, “to name, to decree.” Arāku, “to be long, to last long.” UD = ūmu,
“day.” Šaṭāru, “to write, to inscribe.” Lines 8–10 comprise the second petition. The two
imperatives with their objects are parallel, describing sequential action Nebuchadnezzar
wants the god to do on his behalf: he wants the god to pronounce long life and then in-
scribe that decree on his tablet.
ibi arāku ūmīya šuṭur littūtim
Line 11: (Ina) maḫar, “before, in the presence of, in front of someone.” LUGAL = šarru,
“king.”
maḫar Marduk šarri šamê u erṣetim
Line 12: Abu, “father.” Alādu, “to give birth to” (female subject), “to engender” (male
subject). Note that epšētūya harks back to line 3, where “my good deeds” formed the basis
of the first petition. Now in the third petition (lines 11–13) Nebuchadnezzar requests Nabu
to commend his good deeds to Marduk. Šumguru (Š of magāru), “to cause to be acceptable,
agreeable, to induce a deity to accept a prayer, pious deed” (on the latter meaning, see
CAD M/1, 42). The final vowel on the imperative, which we expect to be šumgir, is super-
fluous.
abi ālidīka epšētūya šumgir(i)
Line 13: Qabû, “to say, to speak, to command.” Dumqu, “favor, goodness.” Idiomati-
cally, dumqī (pl) qabû means “to decree one’s well-being” (see CDA, 62). Nebuchadnezzar
requests Nabu to give him general well-being. The two imperatives are again sequential:𒌋𒌋𒐍 A NB R OYAL P RAYER TO N ABU

he wants the god to commend Nebuchadnezzar’s good deeds and then decree his well-

tional phrase begins each (lines 8a, 11a); an epithet or two describing the item/person
identified in the prepositional phrase follows (lines 8b–9, 11b–12a, both including the
words šamê u erṣetim); then each conclude with two imperatives and their object (lines 10,
12b–13).
qibi dumqūya
Line 14: The last three lines of the prayer form its final petition. Lines 14–15 contain
the direct speech that the supplicant, in line 16, wishes to be placed in the mouth of the
god. d Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, “Nebuchadnezzar,” means “O Nabu, protect the eldest son!”
Kudurru in the sense of “eldest son” is almost exclusively used in proper names. See CDA,
165 (kudurru III) and CAD K, 497 (kudurru C).
Nabium-kudurri-uṣur
Line 15: Lū is a particle expressing a wish, “may it be, let it be,” or affirmation, “in-
deed, verily.” It is related to the precative. One’s translation will be determined by how
one understands the purpose of the deity’s direct speech (expressing the deity’s wish or the
deity’s asseveration) within the final petition of the prayer (line 16). Zāninānu, “provision-
er, provider” (only attested here), is related to the more common zāninu. See CAD Z, 45–
46. Note the lack of a case ending on the noun. Nebuchadnezzar’s role as king is directly
related to his ability to provide for his subjects.
lū šarru zāninān
Line 16: Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed.” In keeping with the characteristics of
a petition, the verb is a precative. Pû, “mouth.” Nebuchadnezzar expresses the desire that
Nabu would utter the words in lines 14–15, apparently before Marduk.
liššakin ina pīka
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Nebuchadnezzar’s first petition is a series of requests: for a long life, a stable
throne, an enduring reign, and the conquest of his enemies. These desires are
quite typical of ancient Near Eastern kings, including those in Israel and Judah
as depicted in the Hebrew Bible. An interesting example from the Bible is Solo-
mon in 1 Kgs 3. When given the opportunity to ask Yahweh for anything (v. 5),
Solomon chose wisdom to govern his people (vv. 7–9) rather than long life,480great wealth, or security from enemies. 1 His choice so pleased Yahweh that the
deity decided to grant Solomon all of the other things that he did not request
(see vv. 12–14). These additional gifts look very similar to what Nebuchadnezzar
requests in our prayer. Solomon’s choice may look somewhat distinctive upon
first glance, but it should be kept in mind that wisdom was often characterized
as a gift of the gods in descriptions of ancient Near Eastern kings.
The idea of a heavenly ledger, sometimes referred to as the tablet of destiny
and in line 8 of our prayer as “the true writing board, which establishes heaven
and netherworld,” is found throughout Mesopotamian literature and corresponds
to the Hebrew Bible’s heavenly scroll (‫ר‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ‫)ס‬.
Shalom Paul has listed a great many
relevant texts from Mesopotamian literature as well as fourteen that name or
allude to the heavenly scroll in the Hebrew Bible (Exod 32:32–33, Isa 4:3,
34:16–17, 65:6, Jer 17:13, 22:30, Mal 3:16, Ps 40:8, 56:9, 87:6, 139:16, Dan
7:10, 10:21, and 12:1). 2 Despite the common mythological notion of a heavenly
ledger, the Hebrew Bible differs, as we would expect in light of its monotheistic
editing, in that there is no separate scribal god that serves Yahweh’s court. Ei-
ther Yahweh writes in this book himself (see, e.g., Exod 32:32–33) or some other
divine being must do it, though one is never actually named (see, e.g., Mal
3:16).

One might compare this request and its purpose to the characterization of Hammurabi in the
prologue and epilogue of his Code. See Martha Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia
Minor (2d ed.; SBLWAW 6; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997), 76–81, 133–40.

A Hymn to Marduk: Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 1– 40
A LAN L ENZI
M ARDUK :
See page 291.
T HE H YMN :
The present hymn forms the introduction to a sophisticated literary poem
called Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, “I will praise the Lord of wisdom.” The lord in the title
is of course Marduk. The poem was written in four parts (“tablets”) of one hun-
dred-twenty lines each and comes down to us today on over four dozen tablets
and fragments in various conditions of preservation.
The opening hymn in Ludlul I 1–40 expatiates upon Marduk’s anger and
mercy. These contrasting attributes are praised thematically but the hymn also
sets up a serial relationship between the two, especially clear in lines 2 and 4:
Marduk’s wrath is followed by his mercy. We may read this expatiation as evi-
dence of divine caprice or a god’s twisted malevolence, but Shubshi-meshre-
Shakkan, the sufferer who speaks in the first person here (and speaks for the
poem’s anonymous author, we presume), apparently did not. Rather, the open-
ing hymn reflects this man’s personal experience of Marduk, which the rest of
the poem retrospectively recounts. The god who became angry with him—
precisely why remains unclear—inflicted suffering upon him both socially (Tab-
let I) and physically (Tablet II) and then subsequently healed his body (Tablet
III) and restored him to his previous social standing (Tablet IV). The poem ends
as it began: with praise for Marduk (see IV 120). Despite our modern objections,
therefore, Marduk, according to Ludlul, is not the divine equivalent of the cat
that toys with its mouse before devouring it. Rather, he is a deity that ultimately
shows mercy to frail and imperfect humans who have angered him. Shubshi-
meshre-Shakkan has experienced this mercy and is intent upon telling others
what Marduk has done for him (see line 39).
The hymn, like Ludlul as a whole, employs rare words, complex grammar,
and a sophisticated poetic style. Antithetical couplets dominate the hymn, a
483484handful of which comprise two four line strophes (see lines 9–12 and 29–32)
that recall Sumerian hymnic style. 1 But the hymn is also punctuated by lines that
do not conform to this dominant style. For example, lines 2, 4, 33, and 34 all
attest a semantic antithesis within their lines and lines 19–20 form a couplet with
synonymous parallelism (see also lines 39–40, possibly).
The hymn’s structure may be analyzed in various ways. For example, one
might see the placement of Marduk’s name as a structuring principle. It appears
in lines 3, 11, and 31, each of which is the third line of a four-line strophe (1–4,
9–12, and 29–32). But it is not clear how this informs our reading of the text,
since the segments thus delineated do not evince a clear thematic coherence or
progression.
Albertz has proposed a detailed structure in which a double frame (lines 1–
4, 29–36, 37–40) announces the theme of the hymn while the hymn’s core (lines
5–28) develops it. Lines 1 and 37–40 correspond in their use of the first person
voice and form the first, hortatory frame of the hymn. Lines 1–4 correspond to
lines 29–36 thematically and form the second frame, presenting the initial praise
for Marduk’s anger and relenting (lines 1–4) and his paramount position among
the gods with regard to the same (29–36). Only here, as noted above, does one
find both anger and mercy mentioned within the same line (lines 2, 4, 33, and
34). The core of the hymn, according to Albertz, may be divided into three equal
parts: lines 5–12, 13–20, and 21–28. Each of these develop the theme of Mar-
duk’s anger and relenting with regard to the deity’s character (lines 5–12) or the
impact of Marduk’s anger and relenting on humanity (lines 13–20 and 21–28).
Albertz sees each of these core parts breaking down further into two antithetical
couplets followed by a four line strophe (of varied structure: A, B, Aʹ, B, as in
lines 9–12, or A, B, C // D, as in lines 17–20 and 25–28 2 ). Although one may
balk at interpreting the final twelve lines of the hymn (nearly a third of it) as
part of its frame, Albertz’s analysis brings out several important features of the
text. Moreover, the remainder of the article shows how the introductory hymn
orients the interpretation of the entire poem.
Moran presents a much simpler structure. As he reads it, the hymn consists
of three parts, each of which starts with a 1cs precative verb. Part one begins in
line 1, two in line 37, and three in line 39. The first part he calls “objective, “for
it hymns the wrath and mercy of Marduk without specific reference to the
speaker.” The second part tells of the speaker’s experience; and the third “an-
nounces his intention to provide the people with instruction in the worship of
Marduk.” 3 Although one might hesitate to see three parts so distinguished, the
use of first person precatives at the beginning and then again only at the end of
the hymn is surely significant (as Albertz would affirm, too). On the one hand,
the absence of the first person from lines 2–36 practically hides the speaker for
1

3
This style is also evidenced in lines 1–4, but this strophe does not employ antithetical couplets.
His understanding of line 27 differs significantly from the text presented below.
See Moran, 255.𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40
485
most of the hymn and thereby emphasizes the hymn’s central concern, Marduk’s
character. On the other hand, despite its limited usage, the first person voice
turns the hymn into a testimonial account, and the precatives generate a perlo-
cutionary effect of exhortation and instruction—common in hymnic discourse.
Despite presenting Marduk as its prominent theme, therefore, the hymn is actu-
ally quite personal and intends to expand Marduk’s claim over the lives of those
who hear it.

1.
lud-lul EN né-me-qí DINGIR muš-[ta-lum]
Line 1: Dalālu, “to praise.” As many of the prayers in this volume have shown, the
1cs precative form of dalālu, ludlul, is frequently found in the closing line(s) of prayers as
part of the common “promise of praise” motif. Here the word ludlul opens the text and
marks its hymnic tone. The initial first person verb signals that the hymn is uttered by the
sufferer in the poem, a man named Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan (see III 44, IV 111, and IV
119). But the first person voice fades completely from view with the second word of the
line. The large majority of the remaining hymn is centered on describing and praising the
object of the initial verb, Marduk, the “lord of wisdom.” The first person voice only returns
in the hymn’s closing lines (I 37 and 39). EN = bēlu, “lord.” Nēmequ, “wisdom.” Bēl X is a
common construction in Akkadian. When referring to humans bēl can designate, among
other things, a person responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows, whether an
office, object, or something more abstract (see CAD B, 198; e.g., bēl šutummi, “steward of
the storehouse,” bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” or bēl dabābi, “adversary” [lit. “owner of a law-4862. e-ziz mu-ši mu-up-pa-šìr ur-ri

suit”]). Similarly with deities (see CAD B, 193). For example, Ea is called bēl pirištim, “lord
of the secret council,” in an OB text from Malgium. Bēl nēmeqi, “lord of wisdom,” here and
in line 3 identifies Marduk as the divine possessor and distributor of wisdom. DINGIR = ilu,
“god.” Muštālu, “thoughtful, deliberate, circumspect.” As mimation had disappeared in SB
Akkadian, one may also read the word as muš-ta-lu 4 . In any case, we expect an acc. case
here, since ilu muštālum is in apposition to the object of the verb, bēl nēmeqi. Muštālum is
also used to translate one of Marduk’s names in Enūma eliš VI 137 alongside eziz (see our
line 2). See also AN = d A-nu-um (Richard L. Litke, A Reconstruction of the Assyro-
Babylonian God-Lists, AN : d an-nu-um and AN : anu ša amēli [Texts from the Babylonian
Collection 3; New Haven: Yale Babylonian Collection, 1998], 90: 192).
ludlul bēl nēmeqi ilu muštālum
Line 2: Ezēzu, “to be(come) angry, to rage.” The form of the word is a 3ms predica-
tive. (Participles of stative verbs occur only rarely outside of proper names, see GAG
§85d.) Mūšu, “night.” Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to become reconciled, to
forgive.” Urru, “daybreak, day.” Note the use of the participle in parallel to the predicative
eziz. The alternation in this line between negative and positive attributes or images of the
deity sets the pattern for the remainder of the hymn, with only a few exceptions.
eziz mūši muppašir urri
Line 3: Adopting the typical Sumerian hymnic style, the opening couplet is repeated
nearly verbatim in lines 3–4. The major difference, of course, is that the deity’s name,

AMAR . UTU = Marduk, replaces the initial verb in line 1. This is a slight variation from the
norm. See lines 9–12. For similar uses of this hymnic form in prayers, see Mayer, UFBG, 40.

Line 4: In a society that relied on oil lamps and the moon for light after sundown, the
night would be an apt association with negative emotions such as anger and fear. The first
light of dawn would have been a welcomed relief from the darkness.
eziz mūši muppašir urri
Line 5: The opening relative pronoun (ša) indicates the line is dependent on an earlier
noun, namely, Marduk. Since the subject of the nominal clause that follows, uggatu, “fury,
rage,” has a resumptive 3ms pronominal suffix on it (–šu, indicated in the writing as –su
since the cluster –tš– becomes –ss–), the relative particle is best translated as “whose.”
Kīma, “like, as.” UD = ūmu, “day,” but the word can also be read as the homonymous ūmu,
“storm,” often used to describe demons. Meḫû, “storm.” Based on equivalencies found in
lexical and bilingual texts (see the citations in AHw, 642, 1420 and CAD M/2, 4–5), it
seems most likely that ūmi meḫê in construct means something like “very violent storm.”
Namû, “steppe, deserted area, pasture lands.” Marduk’s anger is likened to a powerful
natural force that leaves destruction in its wake.

Line 6: U, “and.” Given the fact that the statements in lines 5 and 6 are antithetical,
one might translate the conjunction as an adversative, “but.” Kī (kî), “like, as.” Mānitu,
“breeze, gentle wind.” Šērtu, “morning,” pl. šērētu, “morning hours.” Zâqu, “to blow, to
waft, to gust.” The inf. is being used as a gerund here. Ṭābu, “sweet, good.” The adj. is 3ms
predicative (ṭāb) with the subjunctive –u (line 7 is still part of the relative clause begun in
line 6). Notice the grammatical parallelism between lines 5 and 6. In a land known for its
scorching temperatures, the morning breeze must have been an especially comfortable and
enjoyable part of the day, thus making it an apt simile for Marduk in a favorable mood.
u kī mānit šērēti zâqšu ṭābu
Line 7: Uzzu, “anger, rage.” The form includes the locative-adverbial suffix –um (=
ina) before the 3ms pronominal suffix (–šu); the m of the former has assimilated to the š of
latter (–mš– becomes –šš–). Maḫāru, “to confront, to face, to oppose.” Lā maḫār, a negated
inf. in the absolute form, literally means “not confronting,” thus “unstoppable, irresistible,
not opposable.” Abūbu, “flood,” is often used metaphorically to characterize the inexorable
power of a deity’s anger, a king’s military actions, or either’s weapons (see CAD A/1, 78–
79). Rūbu, “anger, turmoil, fury.” Juxtaposing the words abūbu and lā maḫār in this line
conveys the overwhelming power of Marduk’s anger. Like water breaking through a levee,
it cannot easily be stopped.
uzzuššu lā maḫār abūbu rūbšu
Line 8: Mussaḫḫiru, “merciful,” probably based on the Gtn participle of saḫāru, “to
turn back/towards someone with concern, favor,” is a 3ms predicative (note the lack of a
case ending). See CAD M/2, 235 (s.v. mussaḫru) for the one other known instance of this
word, also used predicatively. Karšu, lit. “stomach,” but here it means “mind, mood.” The
form of the word used with suffixes, karaš–, puts the final consonant adjacent to the š of
the 3ms pronominal suffix. The resulting –šš– becomes –ss–. Kabattu (also kabtatu, see line
36), lit. “liver,” but here it means “mood, temper, emotions.” Târu, “to return, to turn
back, to relent.” This form is also predicative (3fs).
mussaḫḫir karassu kabattašu târat
Line 9: Nakbatu, “weight, combat power, main force.” Qātu, “hand.” Nakbat qātīšu is
the object of the verb in this line. Našû, “to lift, to carry, to bear.” Šamāʾū (šamāmū),
“heavens,” is a poetic term synonymous with the more common šamû. Marduk’s over-
whelming power is unbearable even at the cosmic level.

Line 10: Rittu, “hand, palm.” The final vowel of the 3ms suffix has been elided. Com-
pare line 12. Rabbu (m), rabbatu (f), “soft, gentle.” Given the fact that two Assyrian MSS
read rabbat here ( MSS AA and ff, partially restored), it is probably best to understand rab-
bati, attested in two late Babylonian MSS ( MSS gg and ii), as a 3fs predicative with a super-
fluous vowel attached—not atypical in late manuscripts. Mītu means “dead.” “Dead” is
probably not to be understood here as the cessation of all bodily functions but as “mori-
bund, dying, as good as dead.” Kuššu (D of kâšu) is problematic. Formally, it is a 3cs dura-
tive with subjunctive. Semantically, however, one can take it to mean “to help” (CDA’s
kiāšu; CAD’s kâšu B) or “to delay” (CDA’s kâšu; CAD’s kâšu A). If one accepts the latter
verb, one must take the phrase to mean “it delays (the death of) the dying” (see, e.g., CAD
K, 295). If one accepts the former verb, one faces the problem that the CAD offers no cer-
tain attestations of this verb in the D stem (K, 295). This issue has been mollified slightly
by the fact that new material in Ludlul IV 26 (according to the line numbering of Annus
and Lenzi) does attest it in a broken line that occurs in a context of the sufferer recounting
his salvation: [ . . . ] ukaššu Zarpān[ītu], “whom Zarpanitu helps.” Given this attestation
and the fact that “help” or “rescue” makes contextual sense in line 10, this rendering
seems to be the most likely understanding of the verb (see likewise Foster, 395; George
and Al-Rawi, 194). Marduk, this line states, can also be tender and caring, rescuing those
destined for the grave.
rittuš rabbat(i) ukaššu mīta
Line 11: Lines 9–12 employ the Sumerian hymnic style by repeating a couplet, first
without the deity’s name and then with it. Unlike lines 1 and 3, which also employ this
literary form, the insertion of the deity’s name in line 11 does not replace a word in line 9.
This is the typical execution of the form.
Marduk ša nakbat qātīšu lā inaššû šamāʾū
Line 12: The line varies from its mate in line 10 in that the initial pair of words has
switched places. Notice also that the 3ms pronominal suffix on rittu shows its final vowel
in this line.
rabbat(i) rittušu ukaššu mīta
Line 13: Ina, “in, on, by, among, from,” is best understood here as “on account of.”
Libbātu, pl. “wrath, fury.” Putattû (Dt of petû), “to be opened.” Qabru, “grave.” The opening
(i.e., digging) of graves suggests the need to bury the dead, the apparent result of Marduk’s
anger.

Line 14: Inūšu (Assyrian, enūšu, rendered enuššu in MS ff from Nimrud, for which see
George and Al-Rawi, 197), “at that time, then.” Karašû (karāšu), “disaster, catastrophe.”
Generally, maqtu indicates a destitute person or a fugitive—one who has fallen through the
social safety net, so to speak (see CAD M/1, 254–55). Lines 13 and 14 indicate that many
people will die when Marduk is angry, but he also has mercy on the devastated survivors
of his wrath.
inūšu ina karašê ušatbi maqtu
Line 15: Nekelmû, “to frown at.” The form of the word is N 3cs durative. Nesû, “to
withdraw, to be distant.” Lamassu (= d LAMMA ) and šēdu (= d ALAD ) are anonymous tutelary
deities of individuals, temples, gates, or cities, who are, as line 16 shows, distinct from but
conceptually related to one’s personal god (ilu). Lamassu and šēdu, female and male respec-
tively, appear together frequently in inscriptions and texts (see CAD L, 63–64 and Š/2,
257–58). Lamassū are depicted in iconography as female deities in a human form leading
devotees before a seated god. Acquiring (rašû) a divine guardian is a stroke of good for-
tune for a person. One benefits from their divine protection as these deities walk at one’s
side (ida alāku, see Ludlul I 45) or go before and behind (pāni u arki alāku) their ward. But
when these agents of protection withdraw (nesû), leave (ezēbu), re-deploy themselves (šanâ
saḫāru, “to turn to another,” šanâ šeʾû, “to search for another”; see Ludlul I 46), get angry
(e.g., ezēzu), or the like, one is exposed to danger because the divine hedge of protection is
removed. In our line Marduk simply glowers and these protective agents dismiss them-
selves, leaving their ward open to harm. Clearly Marduk’s displeasure is enough to scare
off the lowly tutelary deities. Conversely, a mere glance of concern from Marduk as line 16
says, and one’s divine protectors return. The hierarchy of the divine world closely parallels
human social interaction: the human and divine kings’ decisions trump all lower-level
contracts or agreements. Even the terseness that relates Marduk’s mood in these lines
(ikkelemmû-ma and ippallas-ma) suggests he need only speak a single word and others
scramble to fall into line. This is precisely how one expects peons to behave under an abso-
lute ruler.
ikkelemmû-ma inessû lamassu u šēdu
Line 16: Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to see, to look at,” often though not exclusively im-
plies a benevolent intent. Ana begins a prepositional phrase in which a subordinate clause
(starting with ša) is embedded. Sakāpu, “to push away, to reject, to forsake.” The subject of
this verb must be the personal god, mentioned next in the line. The pronominal suffix on
this verb is resumptive, referring to the same person as does the initial ša, that is, the hu-
man ward of the god. There is some question, however, about the subject of the final verb
isaḫḫuršu, from saḫāru, “to turn (back) to, to show favor to.” Some take Marduk as the
subject (e.g., D. J. Wiseman, “A New Text of the Babylonian Poem of the Righteous Suffer-
er,” AnSt 30 [1980], 105; von Soden, TUAT III/1, 115, and W. Horowitz and W. G. Lam-
bert, “A New Exemplar of Ludlul Bēl Nēmeqi Tablet I from Birmingham,” Iraq 64 [2002],49017. ak-ṣa-at a-na sur-ri en-nit-ta-šú ka-bit-ti
18. ik-ka-riṭ-ma za-mar-ma i-tar a-lit-tuš
19. id-du-ud-ma ri-ma-šu ú-kan-ni
245), which is grammatically possible. If, however, one reads the previous line in parallel
with line 16, then a pattern emerges in which Marduk’s action is followed by the divine
protectors’ reaction. In this case, ilšu, “his god,” is the most likely subject of isaḫḫuršu (thus
the personal god is the subject of both verbs after the –ma). The pronominal suffix on the
verb is therefore 3ms dative (–šum, with the loss of the final m) and refers to the same
person as the ana ša phrase in the middle of the line (see likewise George and Al-Rawi,
197 and others listed there).
ippallas-ma ana ša iskipūšu ilšu isaḫḫuršu
Line 17: Akṣu, “dangerous, overbearing, terrible.” The adjective is a 3fs predicative.
Ana surri, “immediately, soon.” Ennettu (ennittu), “punishment.” Kabtu (m), kabittu (f),
“heavy, important, grave, grievous.” Marduk’s terrible wrath is quick to strike.
akṣat ana surri ennittašu kabitti
Line 18: Nakruṭu (N of karāṭu), “to be merciful, to show pity.” (This part of the hymn
was not known to CAD K [1971], 215 or N/1 [1980], 196. One may wish to add this refer-
ence.) Zamar, “quickly, immediately.” Târu, “to turn, to return, to turn into, to become.”
Several NB MSS read a final vowel on the verb here. As George and Al-Rawi explain on the
basis of a study in NB grammar (198), NB has a tendency to add such final vowels to dura-
tives of middle weak roots (sometimes in II-y roots and very often in II-w roots, like târu).
Ālittu, “mother, one who gives birth.” The š on the noun may be an apocopated 3ms suffix.
Or, as George and Al-Rawi believe, the –uš ending is a late form of the adverbial –iš and
ālittuš should be translated “like a mother” (see likewise Foster, 395). In either case, line
18 shows that Marduk in a merciful mood can quickly turn “motherly” toward humans.
The semantic contrast in the couplet of lines 17–18 is complemented by the phonological
similarities between them. Compare the k and t sounds in akṣat and ikkarriṭ, the sibiliant
(s, z) and r sounds in surri and zamar, and the t and š sounds in ennittašu kabitti and ālittuš.
ikkariṭ-ma zamar itâr alittuš
Line 19: Lines 19–20, as presently understood, break the pattern of alternating nega-
tive and positive images. Edēdu is difficult. All extant MSS read the verb as iddud, a G dura-
tive. Normally, the verb in the G stem means “to be(come) pointed.” But this makes no
sense in context. The D stem’s meaning, on the other hand, when in hendiadys (as our verb
seems to be with kunnû), is quite suitable to our context, “to do something quickly, to
hasten to” (see CAD E, 24; note the adverbs ana surri and zamar in lines 17 and 18). But
our verb is clearly a G stem. If, however, the alternative restoration of Ludlul II 81 is cor-
rect ([i]-du-ud), there may be another attestation of the G stem with the meaning “to has-
ten” (see Annus and Lenzi, xxvii, n.50, correcting the Akkadian there to [i]-du-ud, and
Moran, 260). Given this possibility and the propensity for our author to use rare verbs or
verbs in otherwise rarely attested stems (see Annus and Lenzi, xxvii), translating the G
with the D stem’s meaning “to hasten to” is the only reasonable and viable alternative at
present. Rîmu (reʾmu, CAD R, 259), “beloved.” Though it is a rarely attested word, it makes𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

better contextual sense than rīmu, “bull.” As Foster notes (395, n.2), rîmu, “beloved,” may
be punning on rīmu, “bull,” given the bovine references in line 20. MS gg personalizes this
noun with a 1cs pronominal suffix, “my beloved,” against MS ff’s 3ms suffix accepted here
(see the next line, too). But MS gg’s reading seems less satisfactory from a literary perspec-
tive. Kunnû (D of kanû), “to care for, to treat kindly.”
iddud-ma rîmašu ukanni
Line 20: Arḫu, “cow.” Būru, “calf.” In keeping with the “motherly” language of line
18, Marduk is compared to a cow with a calf. Arkīšu, “behind it/him.” In light of the
meaning of verb, the “him” is probably best understood as a reference to the cow/Marduk.
Itasḫuru (Ntn of saḫāru ), “to keep turning back/around, to be constantly in attendance.”
Ittanasḫara is a 3cs durative with the ventive. Just as a cow keeps turning around behind it
to look at its calf, so Marduk does to his ward. The variant in MS gg, arkīya, “behind me,”
does not fit this imagery. Instead, it would seem to be working with the analogy of a cow
turning around to get physically behind the calf, perhaps to direct it. The variants may
correspond to two different stages of cow behavior in relationship to her calf. “When the
calf is first born, the cow will nudge the calf from behind, encouraging it to walk. After
that, the calf follows the mother, and she will look back to check on it” (personal commu-
nication from Ms. Jauson King, a bovine expert). Moran notes that the “cow looking back,”
especially as the calf nurses, is a common motif in ancient Near Eastern art (“The Babylo-
nian Job,” in The Most Magic Words: Essays on Babylonian and Biblical Literature [ed. Ronald
S. Hendel; CBQMS 35; Washington, D.C.: Catholic Biblical Association of America, 2002],
194).
u kī araḫ būri ittanasḫara arkīšu
Line 21: Zaqtu, “pointed, barbed.” The adjective is a 3fp predicative. Niṭâtu, pl. “beat-
ings.” Saḫālu, “to prick, to pierce.” Zumru, “body.” MS gg, in keeping with its previous two
lines’ 1cs suffixes, preserves zumrī, “my body.” Lines 21 and 22 renew the antithetical
couplet pattern observed earlier in the hymn. Despite the semantic antithesis, the two lines
show very close grammatical parallelism (but note the alteration between feminine [line
21] and masculine [line 22] grammatical gender).
zaqtā niṭâtūšu usaḫḫalā zumra
Line 22: Pašḫu, “soothing, resting.” The adjective is a 3mp predicative. Ṣindu (ṣimdu),
“bandage.” Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to revive, to restore to health, to cure, to support.” Nam-
taru, “death, fate, (name of a demon).” The object of the verb is always the person receiv-
ing care, not the thing for which they need a cure. Since it is unlikely that Marduk heals or
revives a demon or death, one should probably supply some words for sense: “the one
afflicted by” or the like. The hymn once again affirms Marduk’s compassionate nature as
do many other texts. Note, e.g., this phrase from Šurpu VII 77: Marduk bēlu rēmēnû ša mīta
bulluṭa irammu, “Marduk, the merciful lord, who loves to heal the dying” (CAD M/2, 140).

Line 23: Qabû, “to speak.” Gillatu, “sin.” Ušrašši is a ŠD durative from rašû, “to ac-
quire.” According to Moran, this is the first attestation of rašû in this stem (258). Its mean-
ing here is causative, “to cause someone to acquire something.” In light of gillatu, “to im-
pute” seems a contextually appropriate definition. Marduk need only speak and he reckons
sin to someone’s account. The offending party is not even mentioned. Whatever one’s ac-
tions may be, it is the judgment of Marduk that determines one’s guilt. This shows another
side to Marduk’s absolute sovereignty.
iqabbī-ma gillata ušrašši
Line 24: Išartu, “prosperity, righteousness, justice.” Putaṭṭuru (Dt of paṭāru), “to be
released, to be forgiven.” Eʾiltu, “bond, liability, sin.” Annu (arnu), “guilt, penalty, fault,
sin.” The couplet in lines 23–24 shows several structural and grammatical parallelisms to
the one in lines 25–26.
ina ūmi išartīšu uptaṭṭarū eʾiltum u annu
Line 25: Šū-ma is the 3ms independent pronoun, “he,” with the enclitic –ma. It em-
phasizes the implied subject of the verb, Marduk. Utukku, “demon,” is in apposition to the
following noun: raʾību, “shivering, cramp,” also known to be the name of the demon be-
hind the medical condition (see qāt Raʾību, CAD R, 81). Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause some-
one to acquire (something).” This is the more common causative stem for rašû. One’s trans-
lation must supply the second object, the person on whom the disease is imposed.
Although Marduk imputes guilt and causes illness, the hymn is (apparently) free of cyni-
cism or bitterness. Marduk’s capricious disposition is simply accepted. Apart from some
very poignant but passing protest in Tablet II (lines 10–47), Ludlul’s author seems resigned
to the will and ways of Marduk (see II 48).
šū-ma utakka raʾība ušarši
Line 26: Tû, “incantation.” Marduk and his father Ea were famous for their effective
incantatory word (see, e.g., Enūma eliš IV 19–28, 61; VI 153; VII 11, 26, 33–34 and the
prayer to Ea in this volume, page 227). Šuruppû, “frost, chills.” Ḫurbāšu, “frost, shivering,
cold tremors.” The verb ušdapparu is another ŠD stem durative from the root duppuru (so
CAD D, 186–88, defended by William Moran, “duppuru [dubburu] — ṭuppuru, too?” JCS 33
[1981], 44–47) or ṭuppuru (D of ṭapāru, so AHw, 1380 and CDA, 413). The meaning of the
ŠD, attested only here to my knowledge, follows the D stem, “to drive away.” The final –u
on the verb (in all three MSS attesting this line, MSS gg, ff, and JJ, from Babylon, Nimrud,
and Nineveh, respectively) presents a problem with regard to the subject of the verb. If
šuruppû and ḫurbāšu are the subjects (and the final –ū is the 3mp suffix on the verb), we
would expect the verb to be passive, “they were driven away.” We might even expect this
grammatical understanding given the other parallels between lines 23–24 and 25–26 (note
especially the compound subject at the end of line 24 and the passive, plural verb in its𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

middle). But the verb clearly is not passive—at least, if the decipherment is correct. That
leaves Marduk as the subject and the unnecessary final –u on the verb, which cannot be
explained as a subjunctive. Given this impasse, perhaps we could explain the –u as a scrib-
al mistake, the result of an early scribe understanding šuruppû and ḫurbāšu as the subject of
the (rare) verb due to the false expectation generated by the parallelisms between lines
23–24 and 25–26. But this is only a conjecture. When the textual basis for this line im-
proves, a clearer answer may arise.
ina têšu ušdapparu šuruppû u ḫurbāšu
Line 27: Riḫiṣtu, “flooding.” George and Al-Rawi, 198 disagree with this restoration
but offer no alternative. Miḫiṣtu, “strike, blow, wound.” Notice the consonance between
the two words. d IŠKUR = Adad, a storm god. Erra was a god associated with war, plague,
and destruction (see page 85). The first word of the line is very problematic. The signs that
comprise the verb are securely attested (in one MS ) but there is widespread disagreement
about how to understand them (see George and Al-Rawi, 198 for several options).
Mušmanṭi is here assumed to stand for mušmaṭṭi, a proposed ŠD participle of the root maṭû,
“to be(come) small.” A very tentative understanding of the verb as “who makes slight” (see
the meaning of the D stem) aligns itself with Foster’s “who dwarfs(?)” (395). On this ren-
dering, the line suggests that Marduk’s rage is so severe that it makes the destruction of
Adad and Erra seem small. This understanding stands in contrast with the mercy Marduk
effects in I 28. But like so many other translation problems in Ludlul, this solution must
remain tentative.
mušmanṭi riḫiṣti Adad miḫiṣti Erra
Line 28: Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to soothe, to reconcile, to create peace.” Ištaru, “(per-
sonal) goddess.” Šabbasû, “very angry.” The adj. is mp and modifies both ilu and ištaru.
musallim ilu u ištaru šabbasûti
Line 29: A renewed invocation begins the line. Lines 29–32 underline Marduk’s abso-
lute inscrutability and therefore superiority even among his peers, the other gods. Mimma,
“everything, anything, all.” ŠÀ = libbu, “heart, mind.” Barû, “to see.” Marduk sees, which
implies he knows, everything the gods are doing.
bēlum mimma libbi ilī ibarri
Line 30: Manāma, “someone,” with negative, “no one.” Alaktu, “way, course,” refers
to Marduk’s decisions. No one among the gods can determine Marduk’s intent (see line 32.)
Ul, “not.” Edû (idû), “to know.” Īde is preterite in form but the tense of the verb must be
derived from context.

Line 32: Line 32 repeats the sense of line 30 in different words. Ayyumma, “any,”
with negative, “none, no one.” Lamādu, “to learn.” Ṭēnu (ṭēmu), “(fore)thought, plan, in-
struction, understanding.” The n of this noun assimilates to the following š in the pronom-
inal suffix (see the normalization).
ilu ayyumma ul ilammad ṭēššu
Line 33: The unusual construction ana kī (von Soden, TUAT III/1, 117) prepares for a
contrastive comparison of Marduk’s nature in the first and second halves of each of the
following two lines. This intra-line contrast (rather than contrasting adjacent lines) has not
appeared in the hymn since lines 2 and 4. For kabtu, see line 17. For qātu, see line 9 and
note that –tš– (at the junction of the noun and suffix) changes to –ss–. Rēmēnû, “merciful.”
In lines 33–34, the first half of the line concerns instruments on the exterior of the body
that are capable of violence (hand, a bodily agent, and weapons, the hand’s instrument).
The second half describes internal body parts, representing positive intentions and/or
emotions.
ana kī kabtat qāssu libbašu rēmēnî
Line 34: Gaṣṣu, “cruel, murderous.” GIŠ . TUKUL = kakku, “weapon.” For kabattu, see
line 8. Šunuššu (Š of nêšu), “to keep alive, to sustain.” The form of the word is a participle
used predicatively (3fs). Marduk is called an ilu mušneššu in Enūma eliš VI 151.
ana kī gaṣṣū kakkūšu kabattašu mušneššat
Line 35: Ša lā, “without.” “Without his heart, mind” seems to refer to a lack of Mar-
duk’s consent. Mannu, “who?” Šupšuḫu (Š of pašāḫu), “to cause to rest, to pacify, to calm.”
Without Marduk’s consent, no one can avert what he inflicts.
ša lā libbīšu mannu miḫiṣtašu lišapšiḫ
Line 36: This line restates the idea in line 35 in different words. Ela, “apart from, in
the absence of.” Ayyu, “which (person)?” Šūlulu (Š of alālu), “to cause to hang,” with qātu
as object, “to stay one’s hand.” The line makes clear that no one can thwart what Marduk
intends to do. Obviously, lines 35–36 are not internally contrastive as lines 33–34 were
nor do they form an antithetical couplet as many of the previous lines do. Rather, the cou-
plet seems to end this part of the hymn on a negative note, emphasizing Marduk’s unstop-𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

pable prerogative to punish. Miḫiṣtu (as in line 27) and qātu are the objects of the verbs in

qātu the agent is here paired to miḫiṣtu the agent’s action.

Line 37: Šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to make manifest, to make glorious, to proclaim.” Lines
37 and 39 return to the first person voice, which has been absent in the poem since line 1.
Like line 1, both verbs are in the precative and, conspicuously, commence their respective
lines. Uggatu, see line 5. The rest of line 37 is a subordinate clause that further describes
the first person speaker. kīma, see line 5. Nūnu, “fish.” Akālu, “to eat.” Rušumtu, “mud,
silt.” Fish and birds are attested in rituals describing the most distant removal of an un-
wanted item, e.g., sin (see the examples cited in CAD N/2, 339). The two animals have
access to the extremes of the cosmos in that birds fly to the heavens and fish swim into the
depths. Here in line 37 the sufferer is using the fish simile, I think, to state that he was at
the lowest point to which a creature could descend. The simile probably reflects the fact
that a common fish in the Euphrates, carp, was a bottom dweller that would scour the
riverbed for food.
lušāpi uggassu ša kīma nūni ākulu rušumtu
Line 38: A pair of couplets (lines 37–40) closes the hymn, though they are not strong-
ly antithetical as in previous lines. There is, however, a clear antithesis in terms of agents.
In the first member of each couplet the (first person) speaker of the hymn is the subject of
the verbs (see the first person verbs in lines 37 and 39). In the second member of each
couplet (lines 38 and 40), Marduk or one of his attributes is subject. Enēnu, “to grant fa-
vor.” The –am ending on the verb is the 1cs dative suffix, showing to whom favor was
granted. Enēnu here is an a/u verb whereas the homonymous root used in Ludlul I 41,
meaning to “punish,” is i/i. Zamar, see line 18 (compare the use of arḫiš in Ludlul III 50
and the problematic IV 28, according to Annus and Lenzi’s numbering, to describe the
sufferer’s rapid recovery). Kī here probably means “when,” “like,” or “just as” (compare
line 6). Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), see line 22. Mītūtu could be understood as the abstract noun
“(state of) death.” In this case, we would need to supply, as in line 22, “the one afflicted
by.” More likely, one could understand mītūtu as a pl. substantival use of the adj. mītu,
“dead” (see similarly line 10). In any case, the idea in the line is that the sufferer eventual-
ly becomes the object of Marduk’s mercy, which he has extolled earlier.
īnunam-ma zamar kī uballiṭu mītūtu
Line 39: Šulmudu (Š of lamādu), “to teach.” UN . MEŠ = nišū, “people.” On the sufferer’s
role as teacher, see also Ludlul II 18, 32, and III line p. Qitrubu (Gt of qerēbu), “to come
close up,” in the pred. means “is imminent.” Qitruba is a 3ms pred. with the ventive.
Gumālu is a hapax, according to George and Al-Rawi (198), and may mean something like
“mercy, clemency” (see the CDA’s online archive at http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/
cda_archive/lemmata.htm). It is currently not in any of the dictionaries. MS ff, though bro-49640. ḫi-is-sa-as-su SIG 5 -tu[m] [ar ? ]-na ? -ši-na lit-bal
ken (gi-[mil-šin]), probably used the more common cognate gimillu, “favor, a turn in kind
(both requested and bestowed),” here. Since the purās-noun formation is often used with
prayer-words (see GAG §55k sub 15b), we might place gumālu in this semantic field; thus,
the word could be specifically defined as “a plea for favor, mercy, clemency (something
both requested and bestowed).” The 3fp pronominal suffix on the noun associates gumālu
with nišū (fp), mentioned earlier in the line. This antecedent to the pronoun creates a par-
allel with the noun to which –šina is attached in line 40.
lušalmid-ma nišī qitruba gumālšin
Line 40: The term ḫissatu is used elsewhere to indicate intelligence, understanding,
remembrance, or thought for someone (see CAD Ḫ, 201 and CDA, 117). There are only a
couple of instances in which the term is used with deities, the most important of which for
our purposes describes a person “who recovered on account of the ḫissatu of Marduk,” [ša
ina] ḫissat Marduk ibluṭu (cited in CAD Ḫ, 202). The CAD translates ḫissatu here with
“grace.” However one chooses to translate the term, it ought to convey the general idea
that Marduk shows benevolent consideration for people. SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f),
“good, favorable, kind.” Arnu, see line 24. This reconstruction is highly questionable in
light of a re-examination of MS ff, which is the only tablet that preserves any hint of the
word that once lay before the pronominal suffix. Tabālu, “to carry off, to take away.” The
sufferer ends his hymn with a wish that builds on the optimistic statement in line 39: that
Marduk, having heard the people’s plea, will take away their sin. This is the only time in
the entire opening hymn that we see an explicit statement attributing sin to humans.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Our hymn offers many points of departure for the reader inclined to com-
pare it with biblical literature. Divine anger and its impact on human experience
are probably the most obvious and broadest thematic issues communicated in the
hymn. But space does not allow even a foray into this vast and complex subject. 1
Rather, the comparative suggestions here are limited to two more manageable
issues: the use of BH’s cognate to bēlu, ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
and the cultural-literary associations
of the morning hours of the day.
The Akkadian construction bēl X, “lord of X,” has an etymological equivalent
in BH’s X ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“lord of X.” Like its Akkadian mate, this phrase can refer to a per-
son responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows. Compare bēl šutummi,
“steward of the storehouse,” with ‫יר‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫בּ‬,
“lords of the city, citizens” (e.g., Jud
9:51); bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” with ‫ים‬ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫בּ‬,
“horsemen” (2 Sam 1:6); and
bēl dabābi, “adversary” (lit. “owner of a lawsuit”) with ‫י‬ ‫ט‬ ִ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“my adversary”
(Isa 50:8; lit. “owner of my dispute”).
1
Compare, e.g., the very different attitudes about and contexts for divine anger in Nah 1:2–8 and
Job 9:2–24. The latter passage is remarkable for its bitterness, quite in contrast to what we see in
Ludlul’s opening hymn. For a broad treatment of theodicy in the biblical world, see Antti Laato
and Johannes C. de Moor, ed. Theodicy in the World of the Bible: The Goodness of God and the Prob-
lem of Evil (Leiden: Brill, 2003).𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

Just as Akkadian bēlu came to be a proper name for Marduk (Bēl), the Bibli-
cal Hebrew term ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ was used as an epithet and/or name of an important Ca-
naanite storm-deity, Baal (Northwest Semitic, Baʿlu), who may be related to the
Syrian and Mesopotamian Ḫaddu/Adad. 1 Some of Baal’s local manifestations are
attested in the Bible: Baal-Peor (see, e.g., Num 25:3, 5), Baal-Berith (god of She-
chem, see Judg 8:33, 9:4), and Baal-Zebub (“Lord of the flies,” god of Ekron in 2
Kings 1, though this title is probably a distortion of the original Baal-Zebul,
“Lord Prince”); 2 still other local manifestations are preserved in nine biblical
toponyms (e.g., Baal-Gad in Josh 11:17, 12:7, and 13:3). 3 Although some of
Baal’s features were appropriated into the mythology of Yahweh by biblical au-
thors, 4 the use of the originally generic term ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ for the Canaanite deity moti-
vated other biblical authors to reject the term for Yahweh altogether (see espe-
cially Hos 2:18, but note the PN ‫ה‬ ָ‫י‬ ְ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“Yahweh is lord,” in 1 Chron 12:5).
Apparently, so hated was the epithet/god that early scribes changed attestations
of the god’s name in the Bible to the derogatory ‫ת‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ‫ה‬,
“the shame” (see Jer
3:24, 11:13, and Hos 9:10), even going so far as to replace the appellation with
‫ת‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ when it appears as a theophoric element in personal names (compare, e.g.,
Ish-boshet in 2 Sam 2:8, etc. with Eshbaal in 1 Chron 8:33, 9:39). 5 Of course, the
biblical authors called Yahweh lord, but they did so with the term ‫דוֹן‬ ‫א‬.

This Levantine religious polemic may have made the Judean’s encounter
with Marduk’s related title, Bēl, during the Babylonian crisis of the sixth century
all the more bitter. In several predictions of Babylonian destruction Judean

Opinions vary on the identity of Baal and Adad. See the treatments of the issue in J. C. de
Moor and M. J. Mulder, “‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ baʿal,” TDOT 2:192–99; J. Day, “Baal (Deity),” ABD 1:543; and W.
Herrmann, “Baal,” DDD, 132. For fuller treatments of the storm god, see Alberto R. W. Green,
The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East (Biblical and Judaic Studies from the University of Califor-
nia, San Diego 8; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2003), who treats the biblical material, too, and the
encyclopedic tome from Daniel Schwemer, Die Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens
im Zeitalter der Keilschriftkulturen (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2001). See also the literature

3
See the other eight toponyms in HALOT, 144 and N. Na’aman, “Baal Toponyms,” DDD, 140–41
(and related entries). The plural form of the noun, ‫ים‬ ִ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫ה‬,
appears 18 times in the Hebrew Bible
but its meaning is not entirely clear. The term may have been used for various local manifesta-
tions of Baal or a more generic term for Canaanite gods in general (see J. Day, “Baal (Deity),”
547).
4
See the convenient précis in Day, “Baal (Deity),” 548–49. A classic essay on this issue is Frank
Moore Cross’s chapter “Yahweh and Baʿl” (pp. 147–94) in Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Es-
says in the History of the Religion of Israel (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1973). See also
Reinhard Muller, Jahwe als Wettergott: Studien zur althebraischen Kultlyrik anhand ausgewahlter
Psalmen (BZAW 387; Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008). The use of storm imagery for Yahweh, of
course, brings up a topic that intersects with our hymn (see line 5).
5
See de Moor and Mulder, “‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ baʿal,” 193, who note these changes are limited to the book of
Samuel.
6
See K. Spronk, “Lord,” DDD, 531–33 for more about this title, which eventually became a pious
substitute (‫י‬ ‫דוֹנ‬
‫)א‬
for the Tetragrammaton.498prophets seem to relish the idea of the great Babylonian Bel’s (‫ל‬ ‫)בּ‬
defeat and
putting to shame (see Jer 50:2, 51:44, and Isa 46:1–2).
The opening several lines of our hymn associate Marduk’s favorable nature
(i.e., relenting from anger) with the morning (see line 2, 4, and 6). This manner
of speaking recalls passages in the Psalter that associate the morning with divine
help or hope for divine mercy. 7 Interestingly, several of these passages also occur
in the context of a person lamenting divine displeasure. See, for example, Pss
46:6, 59:17 (and contrast the psalmist’s enemies who are depicted as dogs roam-
ing about in the evening in vv. 7 and 15), 90:14 (with vv. 5–6), and 143:8. In Ps
130:6 the psalmist describes themselves waiting on Yahweh’s favorable answer
to their cry with more anticipation than the watchmen awaiting the appearance
of the morning. Such a comparison confirms rather explicitly the expectation
and hope associated with the morning hours. In light of our Akkadian hymn, Ps
30:6 provides a particularly interesting example of the contrast between
night/divine anger and morning/divine favor. In the context of thanksgiving for
deliverance (vv. 2–4), the psalmist calls on others to praise Yahweh (v. 5), offer-
ing the following as further support for the exhortation to praise: ‫ים‬ ִ‫יּ‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫פּוֹ‬ ‫א‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫ע‬ ‫ג‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ
‫ה‬ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ‫ל‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫י‬ ‫כ‬ ִ ‫בּ‬ ֶ ‫ין‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ָ‫י‬ ‫ב‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ע‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ָ ‫צוֹנוֹ‬ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫בּ‬,
“although (one is) a moment in his anger, (there is) a
lifetime in his favor; weeping lodges in the evening, (but) jubilation belongs to
the morning.” The Psalter also presents the morning as an appropriate time to
request Yahweh’s favor (see Pss 5:4 and 88:14) and indicates in Ps 101:8 that
judgment of the wicked (i.e., vindication for the psalmist) occurs every morning
(‫ים‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ק‬ ָ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫;ל‬
see also Zeph 3:5). Clearly, the morning was often associated with good
things for those in distress. This might make us read the lament in Ps 73:14 as
especially bitter, for there the psalmist complains that every morning brings new
afflictions (see also Ps 55:10, where the psalmist complains morning, noon, and
night).
Why exactly the morning was so often associated with expectation of or
requests for Yahweh’s favor has elicited several creative explanations. 8 Joseph
Blenkinsopp may be closest to understanding the issue when he explains the
association as “simply the feeling that morning puts an end to night as a time of
danger and fear; it is a time for new beginnings.” 9
7
The most famous passage in the Bible in this regard may be the optimistic statement in Lam
3:22–23, where the kindnesses of Yahweh (‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫ד‬ ֵ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫)ח‬
are said to be new every morning (‫ים‬ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ֲ
‫ים‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ק‬ ָ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫)ל‬.

22.17, 385There are few resources for students of the Bible who wish to
work with ancient Near Eastern textual materials in the original
languages but have only an intermediate level of linguistic
aptitude. The field needs something that offers glosses on
vocabulary, grammatical notes, basic literary commentary, and
comparative suggestions about how the text connects to biblical
material. This book provides such a tool for a body of material
that has long occupied comparatively inclined biblical scholars.
The introduction gives a panoramic overview of Akkadian
prayers and hymns, their cultural and literary background,
and the history of modern scholarship’s use of these texts
for understanding the Hebrew Bible, and the volume offers
extensive linguistic, literary, and cultural commentary for the
hymns and prayers in a line-by-line manner.

viAcknowledgments
Several people deserve a word of thanks for their role in the production of
this book. I first and foremost want to thank all of the contributors for signing
on to this project and working hard to bring it to completion. Among the con-
tributors, I especially wish to thank Christopher Frechette, Duane Smith, and
Anna Zernecke. Christopher was a constant source of information, conversation,
and encouragement. This book has greatly benefited from his sage advice and
scholarly knowledge. Duane lent his programming expertise to the project, mak-
ing the transformation of Unicode to cuneiform as painless as one could hope.
He saved me many, many hours of tedious work. Anna graciously took on the
review of biblical scholarship for the general introduction rather late in the pro-
ject, allowing me extra time to focus on editorial tasks. That section is no doubt
the better for her having written it. I also wish to extend my heartfelt apprecia-
tion to several people, including some of the above, who read drafts of my con-
tributions to this volume and offered their suggestions and critical feedback:
Tzvi Abusch, Jeffrey Cooley, Christopher Frechette, Eugene McGarry, Seth Sand-
ers, Duane Smith, and Niek Veldhuis. When I did not follow their suggestions, I
did so only after much deliberation, in full knowledge that I alone must take
responsibility for my work. Monica Schutzman and the Interlibrary Loan staff at
University of the Pacific were a tremendous support throughout the duration of
this project. Getting obscure Assyriological works into the Central Valley is their
speciality. Leigh Andersen from the Society of Biblical Literature editorial staff
was a patient guide as I laid out the complicated pages of this volume. And final-
ly, I wish to thank my family for allowing me to work ridiculous hours every day
of the week during the final months of this project. They are always a source of
comfort, joy, and diversion.

viiAbout This Book
A LAN L ENZI
This book is a pedagogical tool intended to increase reading fluency for sec-
ond or third semester Akkadian students by way of annotated readings. It is
equally an introduction to Akkadian prayers and hymns from ancient Mesopo-
tamia: selected classes, their vocabulary and phraseology, and to some extent
their ritual uses. Finally, the introductory material in this book exposes readers
to theoretical and critical perspectives that will be useful in the study of other
ancient religious texts. More advanced students of Akkadian may therefore find
something profitable here as well.
The idea for this book was inspired by tools developed in Biblical and Clas-
sical Studies in which lexical and grammatical help is printed on the same page
as the ancient text to be read. 1 This arrangement cuts out the time-consuming
process of looking up words and allows the intermediate student to cement their
basic grammatical knowledge and expand their vocabulary through extensive
reading. There is currently nothing like this available for Akkadian.
As many students will attest, academic books are often quite expensive, tak-
ing important tools out of the reach of economically-challenged students and/or
those who may be without access to a well-stocked academic research library. It
is gratifying therefore to make this volume available free of charge through the
SBL’s electronic open-access Ancient Near East Monograph series. If the reader
finds this tool useful, please feel free to share it with others.
Because prayers and hymns—but especially prayers—display stereotyped
forms and utilize a manageable core of vocabulary, selecting texts from this
body of material seemed a perfect choice for this kind of book. But selecting
prayers and hymns also serves educational interests beyond Akkadian fluency
for the book’s targeted audiences. For Assyriological students, learning the forms
and vocabulary of prayers and hymns as well as something about the addressees

See, e.g., Peter Jones, Reading Ovid: Stories from the Metamorphoses (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 2007); Ehud Ben Zvi, Maxine Hancock, and Richard A. Beinert, Readings in
Biblical Hebrew: An Intermediate Textbook (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1993); and Richard
J. Goodrich and David Diewert, A Summer Greek Reader: A Workbook for Maintaining Your Biblical
Greek (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2001).
ixxof such is an important step toward gaining a broad familiarity with the Akkadi-
an religious textual corpus. The contents and format of this book will facilitate
acquiring that familiarity with relative ease, preparing them for advanced study.
Although Classicists are increasingly taking an interest in Akkadian, the majority
of non-Assyriological students who study Akkadian comes from the ranks of bib-
lical scholarship. As there is a long history of interaction between Assyriology
and Biblical Studies in the matter of prayers and hymns, selecting texts from this
corpus again seemed to serve an important segment of Akkadian students. It is
hoped that this volume will fill a gap in the available resources to these Akkadi-
an students and spur other scholars on to produce similar pedagogical materials
for different genres, especially historical inscriptions.
T HE S ELECTION OF T EXTS IN THIS V OLUME :
There are a great many texts one might choose to include in a volume of
Akkadian prayers and hymns. We have made our very limited selection accord-
ing to a few guiding principles.
1. Texts included in this volume represent several different kinds of Akkadian pray-
ers. Not every category of prayer is represented, but a good variety is of-
fered. Due to the great number of extant shuilla- and incantation-prayers as
well as their importance in both Assyriological research and the compara-
tive work of biblical scholars, we have included a very generous selection
from these categories. As hymns are not nearly as numerous and those pre-
served are often quite long (e.g., two hundred lines), only a couple of sam-
ples have been included. But as one will see, most prayers contain a hymnic
element. So even when reading a prayer, one frequently will gain some ex-
posure to the language of praise as well.
2. Texts included in this volume reflect a wide variety of addressees. We have in-
cluded prayers to most of the high gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon (En-
lil, Ashur, and Ninurta are obvious omissions) as well as examples of pray-
ers to personal gods, familial ghosts, and materials used in the cult. Some
deities are very richly represented among extant prayers (e.g., Shamash, Ish-
tar, and Marduk). We have reflected this popularity by including several
prayers addressed to these gods.
3. Texts included in this volume have a suitable modern edition available. The
treatments offered in this volume do not produce a new critical edition of
the prayer or hymn under study. That epigraphic and text critical work has
been done, freeing contributors to focus on helping students understand the
grammar and meaning of the texts. Satisfying the first two criteria above,
however, took precedence over this criterion. There are a few cases there-
fore in which contributors were forced to use a dated edition (e.g., from Er-
ich Ebeling’s Die akkadische Gebetsserie “Handerhebung.” Von neuem gesam-A BOUT T HIS B OOK
xi
melt und herausgegeben (Berlin: Akademie-Verlag, 1953; abbreviated, Ebe-
ling, AGH). 2
4. Texts included in this volume have accessible modern translations available. Alt-
hough each treatment includes a fresh translation, choosing to treat previ-
ously translated texts ensured that each text would be relatively well-
understood. This gave contributors conversation partners in their annota-
tions and offers students more resources for in-depth study.
5. Texts included in this volume are written in either the Old Babylonian (OB) or
Standard Babylonian (SB) dialects of the Akkadian language. Prayers and
hymns are preserved in various Akkadian dialects. But most students begin
learning Akkadian with the OB dialect and then progress to SB. It seemed
pedagogically appropriate therefore to include prayers in these two dialects
(as opposed to also including some in Assyrian or peripheral dialects). As
the greatest number of prayers and hymns are preserved in SB and most
second year Akkadian students will be ready to read these, the SB prayers
comprise the majority of texts treated in this volume.
T HE C ONTENTS OF E ACH T EXTUAL T REATMENT :
Each textual treatment in this volume is self-contained. A student can begin
reading with text no. 13 (𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹), for example, and have all the information neces-
sary within the treatment to read and understand that text. 3 This feature allows
students to read the prayers in any order; it also gives professors the flexibility
to assign any sub-set of prayers in the volume without concern that the student
will be missing something assumed from an earlier textual treatment. Although
this manner of presentation results in significant overlap and repetition, this is
pedagogically beneficial. Seeing the meanings of the same word over and over
will help a student lock it into their memory. As the student’s reading fluency
increases, they can easily pass over glosses and annotations that are no longer
necessary to them. Each treatment includes the following sections:
An introduction to the deity/entity addressed or praised
An introduction to the prayer
The text of the prayer or hymn in transliteration
Notes on the text, including a normalization
Comparative suggestions
A translation in English
The text of the prayer in a cuneiform font
2
One of the most pressing desiderata in Assyriological research related to prayers is a compre-
hensive edition of all of the known Akkadian shuillas.
Cross-referencing between treatments is limited, generally reserved for major issues or refer-
ence to deities.
3xiiDeity. Each treatment begins with a succinct introduction to the entity ad-
dressed or praised in the text. In most cases, this means an introduction to a
deity. But in a few treatments, the addressee is undetermined (see the Prayer to
Any God on page 447) or not a deity (as in the prayers to familial ghosts, see
page 133, and salt, page 189). These introductions attempt to give something
more than what one finds in Jeremy Black’s and Anthony Green’s useful book,
Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia, 4 but less than the very rich
and technical entries in the Reallexikon der Assyriologie (RlA). Although the con-
tent of the introductions varies, the ones concerned with deities usually include
a discussion of the deity’s sphere of power, their position in the pantheon, their
original city, the locations of their major temples, their relationships to other
deities, their iconographic and astrological representations, and their divine
number. The purpose of this section is to help the reader gain some familiarity
with the deity so as to understand the broader context of the prayer. The reader
who works through this book will have substantially enriched their knowledge
of a variety of non-obvious beings from ancient Mesopotamia.
The Prayer. The second section of each treatment gives an introduction to
the prayer or hymn under consideration. In the case of many SB prayers, these
texts are identified by the name of the deity invoked followed by a number (e.g.,
Shamash 1 or Nusku 12). This identification convention follows Werner Mayer’s
catalog of incantation-prayers in his important work Untersuchungen zur Formen-
sprache der babylonischen „Gebetsbeschwörungen “ (abbreviated, Mayer, UFBG). 5
Although one might expect these introductions to vary due to each text’s indi-
vidual character, genre, or availability of data, they also vary due to the differ-
ent interests of the contributing authors. Some contributors give more attention
to the ritual uses of the particular text under discussion while others prefer to
exposit the text’s literary features and themes. This diversity of approach will
benefit the reader by illustrating the diverse results various analytical and inter-
pretive methods can produce. The one common denominator in all of the treat-
ments is the identification of the structure of the prayer, that is, how it “works”
rhetorically.
Essential Bibliography. After the two introductions, each treatment in-
cludes an essential bibliography for both the deity and the text treated. The full
citation for works cited by author or by author and short title in the footnotes to
the introductions will be found here. In the case of prayers and hymns, the bib-
liography includes references to the most recent edition, several translations,
and an important work or two that has discussed the text at some length—if
available. As the title of the section indicates, this is only essential bibliography
as judged by the contributors and the editor. It is not exhaustive.

Edition: Knowing the edition upon which the treatment’s text is based was
considered essential. Full publication information for each witness to or manu-
script ( MS ) of the text was not deemed essential. Usually, one can consult the
text’s most recent edition to learn the identity of the various manuscripts ( MSS ,
that is, tablets) that attest the text. And this will tell the reader where the tablets
are housed and assist them in locating the pertinent hand copies or photos for
further study. Generally, only in cases where the edition is very dated (e.g.,
when the only edition is in Ebeling’s AGH) or is in press (e.g., the shuilla to
Nisaba) has information about the tablets and/or their copies been included in
the bibliography or its footnotes. Consulting tablets (deciphering or collating
actual tablets and reading from photos or hand copies of tablets) is a very im-
portant part of Assyriological research and therefore an essential element of As-
syriological training. The present volume, however, is not intended to be a
handbook on cuneiform epigraphy or a manual on how to produce a critical
edition. It is a tool to facilitate more fluent reading in Akkadian religious texts.
For readers who want to learn more about the textual basis for an individual
prayer, the best place to start is the most recently published critical edition.
Translations: References to the translations by Foster (English), Seux
(French), and Falkenstein/von Soden (German), when available, are included
among the essential bibliography, although contributors may choose to add oth-
ers. Reference to these translators is made by way of their last name alone. Fos-
ter’s translations may be found in Benjamin R. Foster, Before the Muses: An An-
thology of Akkadian Literature (3d ed.; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2005); Seux’s are in
Marie-Joseph Seux, Hymnes et Prieres aux Dieux de Babylonie et d’Assyrie (Paris:
Les Éditions de Cerf, 1976); and von Soden’s (in one of our prayers, Falken-
stein’s) are in Adam Falkenstein and Wolfram von Soden, Sumerische und akka-
dische Hymnen und Gebete (Die Bibliothek der Alten Welt; Stuttgart: Artemis-
Verlag Zürich, 1953), 233–407. For students interested in digging deeper into
the text of a prayer or hymn, these translations, especially Foster and Seux, are a
treasure trove of useful information, often offering different understandings of
the text, pointing to further bibliography, and sometimes including new witness-
es discovered since the production of the text’s critical edition.
The Text in Transliteration. Anyone wishing to utilize Akkadian in their
research will encounter the language in transliteration, that is, in a sign for sign
system of notation using Latin letters and various diacritical marks. The center
piece of each treatment therefore is the text of the prayer or the hymn in trans-
literation. The text is printed a few lines at a time at the top of the page.
The text utilized in each treatment generally follows the reconstruction of
the most recent critical edition with one major exception: in order to avoid over-
loading the student’s eye with epigraphic technicalities, half-brackets in the edi-
tions were ignored. Moreover, no textual apparatus is included and there has been
no attempt to provide in the notes a comprehensive discussion of all of the vari-
ants in all of the MSS of each prayer or hymn. Such would have transformed this
work into something quite different. Occasionally, a departure from the critical
edition’s reconstructed text is identified in a note at the foot of the page. Depar-xivtures may be something as simple as selecting a variant reading rather than the
one preferred by the critical edition because the variant provided a pedagogical-
ly advantageous text. For example, the edition may have selected the harder
reading (lectio difficilior) when deciding between variants whereas the contribu-
tor to this volume preferred the one best suited to a pedagogical context. In oth-
er cases, the critical edition required the contributors to make a decision about
which lines to include and which lines to exclude. For example, various MSS of a
prayer may preserve a self-introduction formula at different places in the prayer
or one MS may insert an attalû-formula while others lack it. If the critical edition
did not reconstruct an “original” text (as, e.g., in the editions for Sin 1 and the
Universal Namburbi), the contributors had to make decisions about what would
be used in their treatment and what would be excluded. It must be emphasized
therefore that the texts used in this edition are no substitute for the consultation and
careful study of a modern critical edition and the individual witnesses that preserve
the text. For readers who want to understand the textual diversity of a given
prayer or take their study of its text to an advanced level, they absolutely must
consult the text’s modern critical edition.
A word should also be said here about the use of sequential line numbering
in the presentation of the texts. Critical editions may reconstruct line numbers
based on what the editor has chosen as the primary textual witness (usually
dubbed MS A). This, for example, was the procedure used by Werner Mayer in
the selection of prayers he edited at the back of UFBG (439–541). In other cases,
the editor contrives a system of line numbering that makes the best sense of the
preserved, perhaps fragmentary witnesses and allows for designating what the
editor deems secondary. When variant lines occur, they are given number-letter
designations (e.g., 7a and 7b would occur after line 7 of the main text) or simply
placed in a footnote. The potential for confusion in this diversity of methods in
text editions is compounded by the fact that some texts are part of a larger, mul-
ti-tablet work. For example, the prayers to salt and to Girra included in this vol-
ume come from the eight-tablet, anti-witchcraft series called Maqlû, “burning,”
and the hymn to Marduk comes from the four-tablet poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi. The
texts of these prayers are properly referenced by the tablet in which the text
occurs and then the line number on that tablet (e.g., I 1–40, which means Tablet
I, lines 1 through 40).
For pedagogical purposes, a simplified consistent numbering method was
decided upon. Throughout the volume, each treatment begins with line number
1 and proceeds sequentially to the text’s end, even when the critical edition or
the position of the text in a multi-tablet series indicated otherwise. There is only
one exception to this practice. In the Universal Namburbi, there is a gap (due to
a tablet break) of undetermined length in the middle of the text (see page 412).
When the text resumes, the line numbering in this treatment begins with 1ʹ. As
is standard in Assyriological literature, the prime marker (ʹ) indicates that the
absolute line numbering cannot be determined due to a lack of evidence among
the witnesses (because of a break on a tablet).A BOUT T HIS B OOK

Annotations. At the foot of the page are brief notes on each line of Akkadi-
an text. Every logogram in the text is given its Akkadian equivalent and the first
occurrence of each word in the prayer or hymn is defined briefly. 6 At the discre-
tion of the contributor, grammatical and syntactical help is provided for difficult
forms or complex sentences. In many notes, the contributor also offers brief
commentary that may highlight a literary feature, a ritual gesture, and/or a
broader textual, linguistic, or cultural item suggested by the text. At the end of
each note the text of the Akkadian line is given again in normalized Akkadian,
that is, in a Latin-character transcription that approximates how the language
would have sounded in ancient times. This normalization is intended to help
clarify the grammar of the line.
Assyriologists have differing ideas about how to normalize an Akkadian sen-
tence. Even the dictionaries disagree sometimes about the normalization of indi-
vidual words (e.g., they often disagree about vowel length and doubled conso-
nants). For consistency’s sake, contributors were asked to follow John
Huehnergard’s system of normalization as practiced in his popular pedagogical
grammar, A Grammar of Akkadian, 2d ed., 7 and the normalization of words ac-
cording to the handbook dictionary most students will use in their early studies:
A Concise Dictionary of Akkadian (CDA, 8 based on von Soden’s AHw 9 ). But there
is an important caveat with regard to the latter’s use. Unlike the CDA, which
always gives the lemma in OB form, the glossed words and normalized lines of
text in this volume always use OB forms in OB texts and SB forms in SB texts
(e.g., amātu instead of awātum in SB texts). An alternate normalization or the OB
form is sometimes given alongside an Akkadian word that is glossed in the
notes. The alternates are given in order to facilitate looking these words up in
the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary (CAD) 10 —the indispensible reference lexicon of
the Akkadian language—or the OB-based CDA. After gaining some familiarity
with the basic sound changes from OB to SB Akkadian (see Huehnergard’s Ap-
pendix D) and some practice, navigating through these minor differences and
disagreements among the dictionaries will be no trouble.
Another point about normalization requires our brief attention. SB Akkadian
shows more freedom in the use of case-endings (final vowels) on substantives
6
Given the multiple contributors to the volume and the varied contexts in which words are
used, the editor has not attempted a thorough standardization of the meanings of words that
recur frequently.

Sippar, and Uruk) show even more freedom—some might say disarray—in this
respect. Normalizations in this volume have not forced these texts to conform to
OB grammatical expectations. The case ending in the text at the top of the page
is also adopted in the normalization in the notes. If the tablet reads a genitive
where one expects an accusative, the normalization will show the genitive. The
contributors often alert the student to these instances in their grammatical
comments.
Comparative Suggestions. Comparativism may have fallen out of style in
many fields (due to Postmodernism’s particularism and the many pitfalls inher-
ent in comparative practices) but it continues unabated among Akkadian-
reading biblical scholars. 11 Given the series and publisher of the present volume,
it seemed appropriate to include in each treatment a section in which the con-
tributor offers ideas about how the Akkadian prayer might tie in to biblical liter-
ature on a linguistic, thematic, or cultural (including religious) level. Assyriolog-
ical students may not be interested in this section. It is easily skipped. Biblical
students may wish for more. That is often facilitated by references to the biblical
text and/or secondary literature. It should be emphasized that contributors were
instructed to offer only brief suggestions not fully developed arguments, which
could easily—but were not allowed to—over-shadow the entire treatment.
Translation. The translations offered for each text in this volume tend to-
ward the literal side of the translation spectrum. They are not intended to be
polished, literary renderings. A literal-tending translation gives the reader one
more layer of help to understand the Akkadian grammar. As the reader advances
in their knowledge of Akkadian, their translations should progress toward a
more sophisticated translation technique. In fact, we encourage readers to re-
work the translations offered here in light of their own interpretive decisions
and as their Akkadian fluency increases. 12

Religious Studies, see Jonathan Z. Smith, “In Comparison a Magic Dwells,” in his Imagining Reli-

University of Chicago Press, 1982), 19–35. A more recent book that builds on Smith’s view (ac-
tually reprinting his essay in full on pp. 23–44) is Kimberley C. Patton and Benjamin C. Ray, A
Magic Still Dwells: Comparative Religion in the Postmodern Age (Berkeley: University of California
Press, 2000).

A brief note about inclusive language: Throughout the prayers, the supplicant is referred to in
Akkadian with masculine singular pronouns. Although in some cases, it is clear that the suppli-
cant is a man, there is no conclusive evidence known to me that the supplicant in all prayers was
always male. Since the masculine grammatical gender was the default gender and since it seems
unlikely to me that women never prayed or needed the services of an exorcist, it seems reasona-
ble to believe women prayed other prayers besides those dealing with specifically women’s is-
sues (e.g., Ishtar 28 and 29). Rather than cluttering up the text with “he or she” or “her/him,”
etc. when referring to the supplicant, I have advised contributors to use the pronouns “they,
them, their, theirs.” For justification of using a third person plural pronoun as a gender neutral
third person singular pronoun, see the online dictionary maintained by Oxford University Press
at this address: http://oxforddictionaries.com/page/384 (accessed last, March 12, 2011). On theA BOUT T HIS B OOK

Cuneiform. At the end of each treatment the Akkadian text is presented in
a Unicode cuneiform font. Unlike the sophisticated shading of signs in the most
recent volumes of the State Archives of Assyria Cuneiform Text (SAACT) series,
there is no indication of restored or broken signs. The available Unicode fonts
did not allow this kind of precision. Moreover, in some cases, the signs are not
quite perfectly shaped. The cuneiform is given here simply so readers can prac-
tice their knowledge of the script. This neat, uniform presentation of the text in
cuneiform is, of course, no substitute for reading from hand copies, photos of
tablets, and eventually the tablets themselves. The reality on the tablets is much
messier and, on first glance at least, more chaotic than anything a handbook can
teach.
The font used for OB texts, Santakku, is based on the OB cursive sign list.
The SB font is called Assurbanipal, based on the Neo-Assyrian inventory of signs.
Both fonts were created by Sylvie Vanséveren at the Université Libre de Brux-
elles. 13 Students wishing to work from the cuneiform are encouraged to print out
a hardcopy of the pages containing this section and use it in tandem with the
transliteration and notes.
other hand, and despite the inconsistency, we have not rendered māru, “son,” in an inclusive
manner when it appears in the phrase annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so.”

A LAN L ENZI , C HRISTOPHER F RECHETTE , AND A NNA E LISE Z ERNECKE *
Interpreting textual remains from an ancient culture requires a reader to
develop multiple competencies that will both situate the textual material in its
original context and translate this material to the contemporary sphere in a
manner that is authentic yet understandable. The interpreter of ancient texts
requires more than a strong knowledge of the language used in the texts; they
also need a theoretical interpretive framework suitable to the material at hand, a
broad understanding of the historical, cultural, and textual issues surrounding
the documents, and a literary competence in the specific genres to which the
texts belong. Religious texts from ancient Mesopotamia present an array of chal-
lenges with regard to the acquisition of these intellectual tools, challenges which
are compounded by the fact that the texts are often utilized in a comparative
fashion. This introductory chapter is intended to help the reader of Akkadian
prayers and hymns begin working through these complex issues and developing
the multiple competencies required to interpret ancient prayers and hymns well.
First, this introduction sets out a general interpretive framework for defin-
ing and understanding prayer and praise within the various human activities we
deem religious. Although space will not permit a full discussion of all the com-
plexities involved, issues surrounding the definition of religion, the academic
study of religion in a post-Enlightenment Western intellectual milieu, and the
multi-faceted character of prayer and praise will receive some attention. The
goal in this section, although apparently distant from Akkadian prayers and
hymns, is to familiarize the reader with some broad trends in Religious Studies
so as to sharpen their interpretive approach to the Akkadian materials.
Second, turning to ancient Mesopotamia, this introduction provides a gen-
eral discussion of the definition of prayer and to some extent praise as they are
applied to ancient Mesopotamian texts in order to fine tune these definitions to
the Akkadian material. This inevitably brings up the thorny issue of how modern
*
Although throughout the writing of this introduction we have enjoyed several collegial con-
versations and offered one another constructive criticism of the other’s material, each scholar is
responsible for their section(s) alone: Frechette for the shuilla-prayer discussion, Zernecke for the
comparative discussion, and Lenzi for the remaining parts.
12scholarly categorizations relate (or should relate) to the ancient scribal classifi-
catory labels that were applied to the texts. The position adopted here is that the
modern imposition of conceptual categories and definitions upon ancient texts is
inevitable and can be quite useful for the modern scholar; however, one must
also be ever vigilant to reflect upon the relationship between the modern and
ancient manner of classifying texts lest one conflate one’s own categories with
those of the Mesopotamians and distort the material being interpreted.
Third, having explored the parameters of Akkadian prayer and praise in a
general manner, the focus narrows to descriptions of the most important kinds of
Akkadian texts scholars have usually classified as prayers. The goal in this sec-
tion is to provide useful overviews along with essential bibliographical assis-
tance that will help the reader understand the specific prayers included in this
volume (and others they may read outside of this volume) within the context of
prayers of the same class.
Finally, a brief survey of the use of Akkadian prayers in biblical scholarship
concludes the introductory material. Akkadian prayers and hymns have a long
history of comparative use, full of pitfalls, missteps, but also insights. This sec-
tion informs the reader of the history of scholarship and offers suggestions for
the way ahead.
Due to the length and varied content of the introduction, one might find it
most useful to read the first two sections before reading any Akkadian texts and
then return to the relevant part of the third section when one begins to read a
prayer from a particular class. The fourth section may be read independently.
P RAYERS AND H YMNS IN A R ELIGIOUS S TUDIES P ERSPECTIVE :
The various characteristics that comprise what is called “prayer” and
“hymn” are commonly understood by contemporary people as falling within the
conceptual domain of religion, a term readily understood when used in everyday
conversation. Though a tacit definition of religion may be useful—indeed, neces-
sary—in everyday life, it repays the careful student of another culture (and
time!) to reflect upon issues surrounding the definition of religion, lest one im-
pose one’s own parochial understanding of religion on the culture under study in
a prejudicial and/or uncritical manner. Of course, defining religion is rather
complex and raises more issues than can be covered, let alone solved here. The
following reflections therefore remain general and are only intended to intro-
duce the philological student to some issues and contemporary literature that
may contribute to the development of a general interpretive framework for Mes-
opotamian religious texts, especially prayers and hymns.
Like other abstract terms used in the social sciences—terms such as art, lit-
erature, or history—religion is not easily defined. 1 Unlike objective entities such

as a book, a desk, or a tablet, scholars cannot simply point to the thing / concept
“religion” and thereby make the referent of the term more or less clear to all
with whom they would communicate. Scholars therefore must devise a technical
definition. As one might imagine, there are no shortages of these in the litera-
ture. Classic theorists often looked to the supposed content of religion (substan-
tivist definitions) or what religion putatively does (functionalist definitions) for
help. 2 Attempts to define religion substantively may isolate one essential feature
(an essentialist definition) that really captures the essence of religion (e.g., Fra-
zer thought belief in divine beings was the essential ingredient) or may enumer-
ate a series of family resemblances a number of which every example of religion
will have. Attempts to define religion functionally tend to look for what religion
does for/to its adherents: it provides psychological comfort (Freud), creates so-
cial solidarity (Durkheim), formulates “a general order of existence” that estab-
lishes “uniquely realistic” “moods and motivations” via a “system of symbols”
(Geertz), 3 or creates a “false consciousness” (an ideology) that veils the true na-
ture of economic exploitation of the masses by the owners of the means of pro-
duction (Marx). Functionalist definitions may also take an essentialist approach,
arguing that one function really explains what religion does and thereby cap-
tures its true nature or essence.
Both approaches have had their problems and detractors. Substantivist defi-
nitions might evoke accusations of prejudice, political bias, arbitrariness, or cir-
cularity. One might easily ask why a belief (intellectual assent) should define
religion instead of, for example, a set of behaviors, or why a majority of broad
features found in the (assumed) major world religions today should define reli-
gion universally (and from the past). 4 Even as functionalist definitions provide
insight into those activities deemed religious, they run the risk of being applied
in a metaphysically reductionistic manner; that is, they may explain religion
defining and the actual definition of religion: William Arnal, “Definition,” in A Guide to the Study
of Religion (ed. Willi Braun and Russell T. McCutcheon; London and New York: Cassell, 2000),

gion, Religions, Religious,” in Critical Terms for Religious Studies (ed. Mark C. Taylor; Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1998), 269–84.

Religion.4away as nothing but psychology, sociology, biology, etc. 5 Or, functionalist defi-
nitions may fail to clarify how their proposed understanding of religion identi-
fies a distinctive subset of human activity. Watching a football game or attend-
ing a rock concert can create social solidarity. Are these examples of religion?
Finally, in as much as substantivist and functionalist definitions attempt to cir-
cumscribe the genuine essence of a “transhistorical and transcultural phenome-
non,” they may reflect a kind of epistemological idealism and/or conceal an
implicit theological assumption on the part of their wielder. 6
Given these problems and pitfalls of defining the concept, some scholars re-
fuse to define religion at all and content themselves with deconstructing what
people might mean by the term. 7 Others, such as Jonathan Z. Smith, have ar-
gued that scholars simply ought to recognize that religion as such does not actu-
ally, objectively exist in space and time but can be understood as something
constructed by scholars and wielded usefully as an analytical category for under-
standing cultural data (i.e., observable human activities and the products there-
of). 8 In this case, the ideas and perspectives offered by substantivist and func-
tionalist definitions, without their absolutist claims, may be incorporated into
this approach in an eclectic manner, if such ideas and perspectives are deemed
useful for the scholar’s purposes. This latter option is adopted here.
Before deciding how to construct this category called religion, it is im-
portant to note that the recognition of “religion” and its continued use among
scholars as a useful category for understanding human culture are the product of
a specific confluence of historical circumstances in the West, especially the Eu-
ropean Enlightenment. 9 This need not negate religion’s analytical usefulness,
since every concept is a product of some place and time and has a history. 10
5
It is well-known, e.g., that Durkheim, Freud, and Marx, all three major figures in functionalist
approaches to religion, were ardent atheists and believed their theories explained transcendental
religious claims away. For the important distinction between metaphysical and methodological
(see below) reductionism, see Russel T. McCutcheon, Critics Not Caretakers: Redescribing the Public
Study of Religion (Issues in the Study of Religion; Albany: State University of New York, 2001), x–

“Transhistorical and transcultural phenomenon” are the words of Talal Asad, quoted in Arnal,
“Definition,” 30. The work of Mircea Eliade, an important and popular twentieth century histori-
an of religion, is often criticized for its implicit theological assumption (see, e.g., Pals, Eight The-
ories of Religion, 223).
7
This is Arnal’s preference (“Definition,” 30). See also Timothy Fitzgerald’s provocative The
Ideology of Religious Studies (New York: Oxford University Press, 2000).

Jonathan Z. Smith, Imagining Religion: From Babylon to Jonestown (Chicago Studies in the Histo-
ry of Judaism; Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1982), xi. Human claims about
the gods and their actions, for example, are observable and therefore count as data.
9
This is argued forcefully by Talal Asad, Genealogies of Religion: Discipline and Reasons of Power
in Christianity and Islam (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993), especially 27–
54, who dismantles Geertz’s once dominant definition of religion. For details about the struggle
of the philosophes against Christianity, see, e.g., Peter Gay, The Enlightenment: An Interpretation,
vol. 1, The Rise of Modern Paganism (New York: Knopf, 1967).

Moreover, without some kind of categorization, one simply cannot begin any
intellectual undertaking—how would one know what to look for? 11 But it is
worth considering that our analytical awareness to mark religion out as a dis-
tinct element in culture is the result of historical struggles in which the cultural
hegemony of specific institutions in Europe, notably the churches, receded and
made room for secular cultural institutions and activities. In a rather unusual
turn of cultural events, that which is called religion in the West lost its unques-
tioned position of primacy in the public sphere (e.g., the separation of Church
and State was only thinkable in a post-Enlightenment context) and has largely
retreated to the private sector. 12 The recognition of this contemporary cultural
context should urge caution when approaching a non-Western, non-modern cul-
ture such as ancient Mesopotamia, where one might reasonably ask, in light of
our modern situation and definition offered below, “What is not religious in
Mesopotamia?” 13
The purpose of providing a definition in this introduction is to create a use-
ful heuristic mechanism, a filter that serves our descriptive and interpretive pur-
poses by identifying a subset of human cultural activity as religious. 14 Due to the
limits of time, skills, technology, interests, observable data, and perhaps our
inability to see beyond our own prejudices, defining religion in this mode will be
limited and limiting in its scope. In other words, this understanding of definition
is methodologically reductionistic. Methodological reductionism, according to
McCutcheon, means one’s definitional stance is prefaced as follows: “given my
methods/theories, the discursive rules of our institution, and my particular set of
11
See Jonathan Z. Smith, “Classification,” 43, where he concludes his essay with this statement:
“the rejection of classificatory interest is, at the same time, a rejection of thought.”
12
These statements are not intended to negate the fact that religious people and groups continue
to have a substantial impact on the public sphere. They clearly do. But their influence in, e.g.,
the United States, is not due to a State-sanctioned, privileged position. Even in some places
where a Christian church does have state sanction, reason seems to have trumped revelation on a
large scale. See Paul Zuckerman, Society Without God: What the Least Religious Nations Can Tell Us
About Contentment (Albany: New York University Press, 2008).
13
See Niek Veldhuis’s comments in his book Religion, Literature, and Scholarship: The Sumerian
Composition Nanše and the Birds, with a catalogue of Sumerian bird names (Cuneiform Monographs
22; Leiden/Boston: Styx/Brill, 2004), 11–13. Bruce Lincoln’s essay “Culture” in A Guide to the
Study of Religion (ed. Willi Braun and Russell T. McCutcheon; London and New York: Cassell,
2000), 409–22 provides a useful model for thinking about culture. Culture, according to Lincoln,
may be considered to be composed of two major domains of human preferences: ethics (what is
good) and aesthetics (what is pleasing). These two domains are always present in culture. Reli-
gion, as he defines it (see below), is a third, potential component that does not offer unique
content (for ethics and aesthetics subsume all cultural content) but authorizes particular ethical
and aesthetic preferences in a way that gives them supra-human or transcendent authority. In
some cultures, religion plays this role minimally, affecting relatively few or only private prefer-
ences; in others, it has maximal effect, touching nearly every ethical and aesthetic preference a
person holds. Mesopotamian cultures, according to this model, would fall on the “maximal” side
of the spectrum.
14
The same caveat applies to the definitions of “prayer” and “hymn” developed below, which
should not be understood as natural categories but constructs used for analytical purposes.6interests and curiosities, religion turns out to be. . . .” 15 Moreover, such a defini-
tion should be held as provisional, a starting point; it should undergo refinement
and adjustment as new data are examined, the definition’s limitations explored,
and one’s interests and focus change.
Given the complexity of human activity in general, a multi-faceted or poly-
thetic definition of religion may be more useful than one that attempts to home
in on a single feature or two. Bruce Lincoln offers the following helpful perspec-
tive on the matter:
Briefly, I take religion to include four different components, which can re-
late to one another in various ways, including disjuncture and contradiction.
These components are:
1. A discourse that claims its concerns transcend the human, temporal and
contingent, while claiming for itself a similarly transcendent status.
2. A set of practices informed and structured by that discourse.
3. A community, whose members construct their identity with reference to
the discourse and its attendant practices.
4. An institution that regulates discourse, practices and community, repro-
ducing and modifying them over time, while asserting their eternal validity
and transcendent value. 16
Turning to prayers and hymns and how they fit into Lincoln’s definition of
religion, one might think they obviously and only belong to discourse. After all,
prayer, in everyday language, is simply a kind of religious or ritual speech that
communicates one’s concerns/petitions to a benevolent supra-human being via
words. Understood thus, prayer as a type of speech includes hymns, which con-
stitute a thematically more specific variety of prayer; namely, hymns communi-
cate praise (predominantly) by the same means. A prayer considered as dis-
course, alongside its primary and obvious purpose of communicating
information (one’s own, often worldly concerns and petitions) to the supra-
human addressee, also communicates something to any human who hears its
words, including the one praying. For prayers, as Sam Gill has stated, are often
“composed for the purpose of edifying, instructing, and influencing people in the
matters of dogma, belief, and tradition.” 17 Thus, prayers contain the petitions of
the supplicant but may also convey to people authoritatively “concerns [such as
theological truths, that] transcend the human, temporal and contingent.” Fur-
thermore, given the general sources from which one learns to pray (e.g., a scrip-
ture [Matt 6:5–13, Luke 11:1–13; Deut 6:4–9; Sura 1], an official prayerbook, a

priest of a god, an authoritative adult, a myth, and/or a normative tradition
handed down from the ancestors), it is not difficult to see how liturgical/ritual
prayer, even spontaneous prayer to the extent that it is shaped by an authorita-
tive model, 18 may at least implicitly claim “for itself a similarly transcendent
status.”
Related to this discourse perspective, one may also consider prayers and
hymns as a form of practice because the words spoken in a prayer have illocu-
tionary effects (i.e., they do things). The very act of uttering the words of a
hymn is to give honor, and the very act of directing words or petitions to a deity
is to seek assistance. But there is more to prayer/praise as practice than an act of
communication that may also give honor or seek assistance. In as much as ac-
tions (rituals, gestures, posture, comportment, etc.) are prescribed to accompany
the verbal act, prayers or hymns display other aspects of religious practice.
These actions, just like the forms of speech used in prayers, are historically and
culturally conditioned and may shed significant light on a prayer when consid-
ered alongside its other features.
Prayers as discourse/practice complexes are always spoken in a particular
social context, a community, which is implicitly or explicitly under the guidance
and (often but not always) authority of institutions (e.g., temples) and communi-
ty leaders (e.g., parents, priests, elders, a headman, etc.). 19 Considering the
communal and the institutional context of prayer helps one see its various as-
pects that extend beyond the individual supplicant. As noted earlier in the cita-
tion of Gill, when considering prayer as discourse, the wording of prayers often
contain more than the communication of one’s personal concerns; they may also
instruct and exhort others. “Such aspects of prayer,” Gill writes, “must be recog-
nized as important and often essential to the continuity and communication of
tradition and culture. In its capacity of performing these important functions,
the formulaic, repetitive, and standardized characteristics of prayer are effective
pedagogically and to enculturate.” 20 In other words, prayer as discourse and
practice is often institutionally prescribed or encouraged as a means of perpetu-
ating or reshaping, in times of liturgical reform, the community. When one
prays, one participates in a community and perpetuates its institutional values,
relevance, and power in society. To modify Donne’s famous line, no supplicant is
an island unto themselves.
Lincoln’s definition of religion brings into focus, therefore, how prayers are
more than texts. They are part and parcel of a whole network of social activities
that reflect and perpetuate the broader social formation that uses them. Failing
18
Note Gill’s generalization in this regard: “the record of personal prayers found in letters, biog-
raphies, and diaries suggests a strong correlation and interdependence of personal prayer with
ritual and liturgical prayer in language, form, style, and physical attitude” (ibid., 490).
19
Even the person praying spontaneously while completely alone will have had some communal
and institutional influence. How else would they know how to pray or to whom to direct it?
20
Ibid., 490.8to take these aspects into consideration explicitly when reading prayers and
hymns—even if the evidence for determining the details of a practice, communi-
ty, or institution is more limited than one would like—may lead to failing to
understand fully or seriously misunderstanding the prayers one reads and the
humans who produced and/or utilized them.
P RAYERS AND H YMNS IN A G ENERAL M ESOPOTAMIAN P ERSPECTIVE :
Although this book focuses on language and on increasing one’s Akkadian
fluency, the above brief remarks provide a conceptual starting point for going
beyond reading Mesopotamian prayers and hymns as texts that simply “speak
for themselves.” It moves the reader toward interpreting prayers and hymns in a
multi-faceted manner as cultural artifacts situated in a subset of human activities
identified as religious. But all of this raises an initial question that needs to be
explored: How does one identify a prayer or a hymn when reading an Akkadian
text? Although this is not the place to present a complete discussion of what
might constitute a genus “Mesopotamian ritual speech” of which “prayer” might
be distinguished as a species, some consideration of this issue is in order.
One could begin to answer this question of identification with an appeal to
particular textual details such as scribal rubrics (a label at the end of a text) or
superscripts (a label at the head of a text) that the ancient scribes used to identi-
fy and classify their own writings. In other words, one could identify prayers
based on the Mesopotamians’ own ideas of classifying prayers. Potential candi-
dates of such scribal metadata could include én, én-é-nu-ru, šu-íla, tamītu, ikribu,
ér-šà-ḫun-gá, nam-búr-bi, nam-érim-búr-ru-da, uš 11 -búr-ru-da, dingir-šà-dib-ba,
etc. Having identified these, one could then populate the categories of prayer
and hymn based on an indigenous classification. Unfortunately, the indigenous
labels are often problematic in their own right (see the extensive discussion of
the shuilla-rubric below), and not every text bears one, thus potentially depriv-
ing the dataset of some relevant texts. Moreover, while some rubrics, for exam-
ple, ikribu, might be translated generically as “prayer,” there is no native classi-
fier that corresponds to the broad categories of prayers and hymns proposed
here. Thus, there is a more fundamental problem with this well-meaning meth-
odology: one must already know what a prayer/hymn is before one can identify
the indigenous superscripts or rubrics that would supposedly populate the cate-
gory with texts. Rather than using tacit notions of prayer and hymn as a guide,
one might instead simply recognize that one is guided initially in the classifica-
tory endeavor by specific definitions arising from one’s own sphere and then to
refine and clarify these definitions in interaction with the data that is encoun-
tered from the ancient world. In other words, in proposing to treat certain Akka-
dian texts as prayers and hymns, the modern reader must impose their own ide-I NTRODUCTION
9
as upon them initially. 21 But as the modern reader works with the texts, a pro-
cess is initiated in which one attempts to understand them with increasing preci-
sion within their own cultural contexts. Ideally, this process will in turn lead to
improvements in the models/definitions one uses to translate and interpret the
texts in and for the contemporary sphere.
An initial foray into the subject might begin with an everyday notion of
prayer and hymn as mentioned above. A prayer, to start with, is a kind of reli-
gious, ritual form of speech that communicates one’s concerns/petitions to a
benevolent supra-human being (or more than one being) via words; a hymn is a
similar communication with a narrower thematic focus: petition is either lacking
or very restricted while praise and adoration (the expression of a different kind
of concern) dominate the text. The boundary between the two is not hard and
fast. Despite the fuzzy boundary, these initial definitions are useful for the pre-
sent analytical purpose. But there are some aspects of the definitions that raise
important questions that deserve fuller consideration. In the attempt to answer
these questions, the definition of prayer offered above will develop toward one
that more suitably fits the Mesopotamian data.
First, what does benevolent supra-human being mean in polytheistic ancient Mes-
opotamia? 22 In Mesopotamia there were a great many entities that were not hu-
man, though characterized anthropomorphically, 23 and had powers that went
well-beyond normal human capacity. These supra-human beings included
ghosts, gods, protective spirits (e.g., lamassū and šēdū), demons, witches, certain
cult-objects, and others (e.g., the apkallū, “primordial semi-divine sages”). 24 Hu-
mans could use ritual speech to communicate with all of these beings; descrip-
21
Although this point is a commonplace among social scientific and religious studies scholars, it
seems to be resisted by ancient historians. See classicist Sarah Iles Johnston’s review article
“Describing the Undefinable: New Books on Magic and Old Problems of Definition,” History of
Religions 43.1 (2003), 50–54, especially 54 for the same conclusion as presented above. In her
concluding remarks, she offers an important reason for imposing our own categories on the data
we study. She says that “without etic categories [that is, categories defined by the outside inves-
tigator], however provisional, the Hellenist is unable to talk to the Assyriologist, the Egyptologist
to the scholar of Judaism.” In other words, if our work is to be meaningful and informative be-
yond the insular world of our own fields of study, constructing meaningful categories that com-
municate across contemporary academic boundaries is absolutely essential.
22
We could, of course, have asked something similar about our own contemporary setting in the
earlier general discussion, but such was unnecessary for our present purposes.
23
One can see the anthropomorphism even in the incantation-prayer addressed to salt (see page
189) and in the one to the horse that pulls Marduk’s chariot in W. G. Lambert, Babylonian Oracle
Questions (Mesopotamian Civilizations 13; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2007), no. 9, lines 15–27.
For the role of anthropomorphism in the human imagining of supra-human powers, see Stewart
Guthrie, Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995)
generally and What Is a God? Anthropomorphic and Non-Anthropomorphic Aspects of Deity in An-
cient Mesopotamia (ed. Barbara Nevling Porter; Transactions of the Casco Bay Assyriological
Institute 2; Chebeaugue Island, ME: Casco Bay Assyriological Institute, 2009) for ancient Meso-
potamia.
24
See Black and Green for a convenient summary of the most important of these.10tions of such communication as well as the actual texts that contain these com-
munications are well-attested. Many of these powerful beings could be both be-
nevolent and malevolent toward a human. Enlil, for example, could be gracious
or vindictive; family ghosts could be implored for help or ritually expelled to the
netherworld; the apkallū, the sages of Ea, could assist or afflict humans; Pazuzu
was to be feared in his own right as a demon but could also be utilized for apo-
tropaic purposes against Lamashtu. 25 In order for a definition of prayer to be
useful in Mesopotamia, it needs to specify that “benevolent supra-human being,”
for the present purposes, refers to any supra-human being to whom a text directs
itself and about whom the text assumes, implicitly or explicitly, sufficient power
to aid the speaker. Because the text expresses hope for a beneficent response,
one might find words of deference or honor addressed to the supra-human pow-
er at the beginning of the communication (see below, for example, on the struc-
ture of the incantation-prayer). This text-centered orientation makes speculation
about an actual speaker’s subjective intention or emotion irrelevant. The per-
spective and warrants of the text are all that is accessible to modern readers.
Because the present definition defines prayer as something directed to be-
nevolent supra-human powers, texts that communicate concerns or desires to
malevolent demons, ghosts, witches, illnesses, and other powerful entities are
not prayers. The same applies to texts that address themselves to mere humans
or no one in particular, benevolent or otherwise. These texts use forms of ritual
speech, to be sure (see below); but an investigation of the broader domain of
“Mesopotamian ritual speech” goes beyond the present purpose, which is fo-
cused on the narrower categories of Mesopotamian prayer and the even more
focused category of hymn or praise. Other forms of ritual speech will be brought
into the present discussion only in so far as they help delineate the conceptual
parameters of prayer and praise by way of contrast (see fig. 1).
Second, does the descriptor “communication via words” in the initial definition
do justice to the Mesopotamian data about prayer and praise? Despite the promi-
nence and therefore usefulness that verbal communication has for the present
purpose (this book does after all deal with language), the answer is negative.
“Communication via words” does Mesopotamian prayer justice no more than it
does justice to the contemporary Muslim practice of ṣalāt (   ). Throughout the
ancient Near East, texts that contain or describe prayers and hymns—recognized
as such by the initial definition given above—often record or prescribe various
bodily gestures. These may include prostration, raising one’s hands, kneeling,
lifting up one’s head, facing oneself toward a temple, etc. as well as ritual acts
25
For the malevolent and benevolent character of some of these in Mesopotamian tradition from
an iconographic perspective, see Anthony Green, “Beneficent Spirits and Malevolent Demons:

such as setting up altars, making offerings, applying substances to one’s body,
and manipulating objects (e.g., figurines or other items) before, during, and/or
after the recitation of the verbal communication. For a variety of reasons, the
descriptions of such practices may not be preserved with the texts to be recited
and so may not be as easily identified. Nevertheless, attending to these other
features—and therefore adjusting the definition of prayer in light of them—is
important in order to avoid a truncated understanding of Mesopotamian prayer
and praise. In order to capture the discourse/practice complex that is Mesopo-
tamian prayer, it is advisable to think about most prayers as “ritual-prayers,”
comprising dromena, that which is done, and legomena, that which is spoken. 26
Further, a definition of Mesopotamian prayer should avoid making commu-
nication via words a central or essential feature. Obviously the verbal or textual
side of prayer is important for the purposes of this volume. Yet this focus should
not unduly limit one’s view of Mesopotamian prayer and praise. Although non-
verbal prayer is not explored in this volume, it is important to keep in mind that
a votive statue placed in a temple or a cylinder seal depicting a presentation
scene may represent a petitioner’s attempt to express their concerns or praise to
a benevolent being visually, a manner completely lacking any linguistic form of
communication. 27
26
There are exceptions. Some prayers, e.g., the prayers used in royal building inscriptions, do
not as far as we know have a ritual element.
27
For general remarks on votive statues, see, e.g., Dominique Collon, Ancient Near Eastern Art
(Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1995), 60–62, with a photo of the
famous Tell Asmar votive statues; on presentation scenes, see her Near Eastern Seals (Interpreting
the Past; Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1990), 46–47. We should not
neglect to mention the fact that some cylinder seal legends (inscriptions) contained actual pray-
ers in Sumerian and Akkadian. Although probably not intended for speaking aloud, these in-
scribed supplications were “recited” with each impression of the seal. For many examples of
these silent prayers, see Henri Limet, Les legendes de sceaux cassites (Académie royale de Bel-
gique, Classe des letters: Mémoires LX/2; Bruxelles: Palais des Académies, 1971).12Third, does the phrase “one’s concerns/petitions” adequately capture all that one
might see in Mesopotamian texts identified as prayers? No. One might suggest that
petitions, easily identified since they are usually expressed grammatically with
imperatives or precatives, are essential to identifying and understanding prayers
because supplicants seem always to present at least one request in the course of a
prayer and sometimes many, many more (as in, e.g., Nebuchadnezzar’s prayer to
Nabu on page 475). 28 But petitions sometimes comprise a tiny fraction of what
one sees in a prayer. For example, in Nabu 1 (see page 325), the petition consists
of only one line in twenty, a mere five percent. Moreover, hymns, a subset of
prayer, may not contain a petition at all, but occupy themselves with enumerat-
ing the character and actions of the deity. Although one might say that con-
cerns/petitions capture important aspects of the content of prayers and hymns, it
would be a mistake to absolutize these as the exclusive content of what is com-
municated in the texts. What else therefore might a Mesopotamian prayer/hymn
generally contain?
Although an exhaustive listing is not appropriate here (in some cases, more
detail will be presented when various kinds of prayers are introduced), the fol-
lowing are important general elements one will find in the texts. Mesopotamian
prayers normally begin with an invocation of the deity by name, which identi-
fies the benevolent supra-human being to whom the prayer is directed. Just as
one might speak one’s friend’s name aloud in a group to gain their attention
before conversing with them, the invocation is intended to get the supra-human
being’s attention before the prayer continues on to other matters. Prayers also
often contain praise. Along with the invocation, for example, one may see a
hymnic introduction in which the supplicant praises the deity invoked via a list
of divine epithets, attributes, actions, or other features. This introductory praise
functions as a kind of formal greeting, a social protocol utilized when a social
inferior approaches a social superior with an unsolicited address (see the discus-
sion of shuillas below). When this hymnic element is present, the length varies
significantly from as little as one line to a dozen or more. Prayers may also end
with praise of thanksgiving, or rather, a promise to give the deity thanks via
verbal (see, e.g., the end of incantation-prayers) and/or other ritual means (see,
e.g., the animal sacrifices in the OB letter-prayer to Ninmug on page 105). In the
subset of prayer identified here as hymn, praise predominates throughout. An-
other common element of content in prayers is the self-presentation or self-
introduction formula, in which the supplicant identifies their name, filiation,
and perhaps personal gods. The supplicant may also voice their concerns in the
form of complaints or laments about the problems that have given them reason
to seek supra-human assistance. 29 During the course of praising, complaining to,
28
Moreover, hymns are not entirely devoid of petition. See, e.g., the OB hymn to Ishtar on page
111.
Cultic laments such as balags and ershemmas, composed in Sumerian and used liturgically by
the kalû, “cult-singer,” fall outside the purview of this study. The ershaḫunga-prayers, however,

or petitioning the deity or in their promise of thanksgiving the supplicant may
refer to various ritual actions they have performed, are performing, or will per-
form. These descriptions in the text of the prayer are not always identical to or
do not always seem to correspond to the ritual instructions that may accompa-
ny the text. (The ritual instructions may be listed in a separate section on the
tablet at the end of the prayer or written on a separate ritual tablet altogether in
the case of prayers that belong to long ritual series such as Maqlû.) The reason
for what seems to be an imperfect correspondence may be due to the fact that
the precise meaning of a ritual act mentioned in the prayer is not fully under-
stood (e.g., sissikta ṣabātu, “to seize the hem”), that the ritual instructions are
truncated or entirely lacking, the prayer or ritual has undergone scribal devel-
opment, leaving evidence of such in the resulting mismatch, and/or that the text
assumes the specialist would have known certain routine procedures and there-
fore did not record them (e.g., when to bow, when to kneel, etc.). But there are
numerous instances of the contrary situation; that is, there are texts that show a
close correspondence between ritual actions mentioned in the prayer and the
ritual instructions (see, e.g., Nusku 12 on page 179). 30
Fourth, despite the complexities of the issue, it is an important and worth-
while exercise to revisit the earlier concern with indigenous categorization of
texts and ask, Does the definition of Mesopotamian textual prayer developed here jibe
with the various Mesopotamian categorization of texts (i.e., the scribal metadata)?
And if not, should this be a concern? To the first question, the answer will have to
be a firm no; the present definition actually cuts across various Mesopotamian
scribal categories. The answer to the second question should probably be both
yes and no. It should be a concern that the present definition does not corre-
spond to any ancient category and one ought to remain aware of the fact that a
modern scholarly conceptualization of categories is different from the indige-
nous Mesopotamian ones. On the other hand, it is the prerogative of the inter-
preter to establish what seem to be productive avenues of cultural interpreta-
tion, including how to categorize and organize data so that it will communicate
with contemporaries. Indigenous sources are just that, sources. They should of
course inform contemporary scholarship; but they should not dictate the interpre-
tive results. 31 The brief discussion in the next several paragraphs will show via
also part of kalûtu, “the craft of the cult-singer,” are discussed below. Although the balags and
ershemmas were also given interlinear Akkadian translations by ancient scribes, the ershaḫungas
were included in this volume because they have affinities with some of the monolingual Akkadi-
an penitential prayers for individuals (i.e., the dingirshadibbas and the shuilla Marduk 4). More-
over, the one ershaḫunga-prayer treated in this volume, the prayer to any god (see page 447),
has appeared in various anthologies of Mesopotamian/Akkadian prayers.

When our ancient sources are allowed to determine or dictate to us our interpretive results,
we have moved from being an ancient historian to a curator or caretaker of antiquity. See Bruce
Lincoln, “Theses on Method,” Method & Theory in the Study of Religion 8 (1996), 225–27 (reprint-
ed in MTSR 17 [2005], 8–10).14concrete examples how the present categorization of prayer cuts across known
Mesopotamian scribal categories and how this informs and refines the present
understanding of prayer. The discussion will also suggest, however, that there is
an interpretive benefit in maintaining modern constructions of categorization
despite the important ancient scribal rubrics and superscripts that have come
down to us.
Consider the following two texts. Each is the ritual wording of a (different)
shaziga-ritual that was used to remedy a man’s sexual impotence. The Sumerian
term šà-zi-ga (Akk. nīš libbi, “rising of the heart”) was the rubric scribes used to
classify the purpose of these rituals. They normally placed the rubrics at the end
of the text. The superscript én, discussed further below, marks the beginning of
the ritual’s wording recited in the course of the ritual.
én: Let the wind blow (lillik)! Let the grove quake (linūš).
Let the clouds gather (lištakṣir)! Let the moisture fall (littuk)!
Let my potency be (lū) flowing river water!
Let my penis be (lū) a (taut) harp string
So that it will not slip out of her! tu 6 én. 32
én: O Adad, canal inspector of heaven, son of Anu,
Who gives oracular decisions for all people, the protector of the land,
At your supreme command which cannot be opposed,
And your faithful affirmation which cannot be altered,
May NN son of NN, become stiff (limgug) 33 for NN, daughter of NN,
may he come into contact with (limḫaṣ), mount (lirkab), and
penetrate (lišērib) (her)! tu 6 én. 34
The second text begins with an invocation of a supra-human being; there
are several honorific epithets and statements intended to glorify the deity; and
the text concludes with a complex petition (note the four precatives) for the dei-
ty to act upon. It becomes clear in the course of the prayer that the deity is con-
strued as benevolent because a) he is assumed to be interested in hearing the
prayer and b) he is assumed to be capable of acting upon it for the benefit of the
supplicant. This text is clearly a prayer according to the definition developed
above (more specifically, modern scholars call this text an “incantation-prayer,”
about which see page 24 below). 35

Robert D. Biggs, Šà.zi.ga: Ancient Mesopotamian Potency Incantations (TCS 2; Locust Valley: J. J.
Augustin, 1967), 35 (text no. 15). Line 19, the last line of the ritual, gives the purpose of this
ritual-prayer as šà-zi-ga. The translation is Biggs’, only slighted adjusted here and in the follow-
ing in that I have not translated the opening and closing formulae (én and tu 6 én).

Biggs, Šà.zi.ga, 42 (text no. 23). Line 13 gives the following rubric after the wording and be-
fore the ritual: ka-inim-ma šà-zig-ga, “the wording of a shaziga.” NN is a placeholder, meaning
“so-and-so.” The actual names of the people involved would be filled in during the ritual.

Mayer, UFBG, 378 identifies this incantation-prayer as Adad 8.I NTRODUCTION
15
As for the first text, the agent to whom it is directed, if any at all, is unclear;
there is no invocation. The text does, however, contain what one might call peti-
tions (note the four precatives and the two uses of lū). These statements are
grammatically identical to what one sees in the petitions of the second text. In
fact, the precatives in the first shaziga dominate the text even more so. But the
precatives in this first text have a more general character than those in the sec-
ond. Although the precatives in both texts express the speaker’s desires (wishes,
hopes), only those in the second may be further qualified as petitions since peti-
tions by definition require the involvement of one thought capable of responding
(the addressee, Adad). As there is no invocation of a benevolent supra-human
being to act upon the precatives in the first text, they remain conceptually at a
more general level of expressed desire. Because it lacks an invocation of a be-
nevolent supra-human being, praise, and petition the first shaziga, according to
the present definition, is not a prayer (or hymn); rather, it is another form of
ritual speech.
To be sure, both texts belong to the corpus of shaziga-rituals, designated by
a common rubric; both texts were used for the same general remedial purpose.
But only the second one qualifies as a prayer according to the definition devel-
oped above. One might be inclined to adjust one’s definition of prayer to ac-
count for this mismatch between the modern definition and the ancient rubrics.
This is, of course, one way to allow the evidence to re-shape the heuristic defini-
tion. The following paragraphs, however, will suggest that such is unnecessary
and ultimately may be unhelpful to the larger interpretive project.
The two examples of shazigas bring up another, more general (and trouble-
some) scribal label that illustrates how the present definition of prayer cuts
across Mesopotamian categories: the Sumerian superscript én or én-é-nu-ru in
OB and older texts. 36 These Sumerian terms are equivalent to the Akkadian term
šiptu and translated into English, conventionally and unfortunately, as “incanta-
tion.” 37 As was stated earlier, there are a great many ritual texts in Akkadian
that contain prescribed words to communicate concerns or desires to demons,
ghosts, witches, illnesses, and other malevolent things/forces. These texts usual-
ly communicate a desire for protection from (apotropaism) or the expulsion of
(exorcism) these forces. The following is a representative example:
én: Fire, fire!
Fire seized a lone man.
It seized (his) insides, (his) temple,

(Stupia Pohl: Series Maior 17; Roma: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1997) for a catalog and analyt-
ical study.
37
The translation is unfortunate because “incantation” has been closely associated with magic,
paganism, primitivism, and generally those things that are “other” to “true” religion (especially
as defined by Protestant Europeans). For the intellectual background to such issues in the West,
see Stanley Tambiah, Magic, Science, Religion, and the Scope of Rationality (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1990), 1–41.16It spread (to others) the gnawing of (his) insides,
The stock of the human race was diminished.
Belet-ili went before Ea the king,
“O Ea, humankind was created by your spell,
“Second, you pinched off their clay
from the firmament of the depths.
“By your great command, you determined their capacities.
“I cast a spell on the ...-disease, fever, boils,
“Leprosy(?), jaundice!
“Rain down like dew,
“Flow down like tears,
“Go down to the netherworld!”
This incantation is an incantation of Belet-ili, the great queen. 38
Although these kinds of texts are clearly excluded from the present understand-
ing of prayer because they are directed at malevolent (here, an illness) rather
than benevolent powers, they often bear one of the two Sumerian superscripts,
én or én-é-nu-ru, under discussion. There are a number of other texts that also
bear one of these superscripts but are directed at such things as an animal, the
wind, a would-be human lover, and in some cases nothing clearly discernible, as
in the first shaziga cited above. Finally, as in the second shaziga cited, there are
still other texts that bear the én superscript but also fit the present definition of
prayer. In fact, nearly all of the SB shuilla- and dingirshadibba-prayers in this
volume bear the én superscript (and are therefore usually called “incantation-
prayers” by contemporary scholars). Besides recognizing that our constructed
category of prayer cuts across another indigenous Mesopotamian scribal catego-
ry, this fact calls for some deeper reflection about how the notion of prayer that
is developed here relates to the ancient Mesopotamian category of ritual speech
labeled én—a Sumerian. term often translated simply as “incantation” but better
rendered “ritual wording.” 39
First, applying an antiquated Frazerian dichotomy between “mechanical”
magic and “personal” religion—personal in that volitional agents are involved—
should be resisted because it is not helpful in clarifying or explaining the texts. 40
38
See W. G. Lambert, “Fire Incantations,” AfO 23 (1970), 39–45 for an edition of the text and
Foster, 971, whose translation is cited here.
Despite the fact that “ritual wording” is probably a better translation of the terms én and šiptu,
the conventional translation “incantation” is so entrenched in Assyriological scholarship that we
have (hesitantly) opted to use this rendering throughout the volume. For how our modern notion
of prayer does not correspond with the ancient superscript én, see briefly W. G. Lambert, “The
Classification of Incantations,” in Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale,
Held at the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005 (ed. Robert D. Biggs,
Jennie Myers, and Martha T. Roth; SAOC 62; Chicago: Oriental Institute, 2008), 93–97 (refer-
ence courtesy of Christopher Frechette).

In discussing these two shaziga-prayers above, their ancient scribal categoriza-
tion, and how these relate to a modern definition of prayer, only the formal,
linguistic features of the texts have been addressed. Both shazigas—both of
which also bear the én superscript—are forms of ritual speech used for the same
remedial purpose, and they “work” conceptually rather similarly, whatever one
decides to call them in a modern system of classification. Note, for example, the
ritual instructions that follow each of the two shazigas. 41 Although the instruc-
tions for each text differ with regard to the accompanying ritual actions, they do
agree that the ritual wording for each, identified on the tablet with the én super-
script in both cases, is to be recited seven times. Despite their respective ad-
dressees (or lack thereof), both were apparently considered more effective when
repeated multiple times. If repetition of words is associated with “mechanical”
magic, as it often was among some past interpreters, 42 then one would have to
argue that the shaziga that the above definition identifies as a prayer (called an
“incantation-prayer” by scholars today) is just as “magical” as the shaziga that
the above definition dismisses from the category of prayer (and therefore is of-
ten simply called an “incantation” by modern scholars). In this case, therefore,
the magic vs. religion model is not very helpful in making sense of the data. A
better interpretation is to recognize that the common ritual instructions calling
for repetition of these two shazigas point to conceptual similarities in the utiliza-
tion of these two examples of ritual speech (both labeled én by the ancients),
despite the modern distinction in seeing one as prayer and one as not-prayer.
Another important point in this regard is that the involvement of a deity in
a text labeled a prayer by modern scholarship does not necessarily impute to this
form of ritual speech a more contingent or uncertain efficaciousness than that
associated with texts one might view as “mechanical” incantations. It would be a
mistake to think that the supplicant nervously had to await the deity’s answer to
the shaziga identified as a prayer but could feel confident that the other text
worked automatically against whatever or whomever it was directed. 43 There
are, to be sure, places where one reads of supplicants asking a deity to hear or
accept their prayer and others when supplicants mention how a deity has ac-
cepted or heard their prayer. 44 There are even complaints about unheeded pray-
ers (see Marduk 4, lines 3–4 on page 296). Clearly, the personal-agent-element
of a prayer elicited talk from the Mesopotamians about prayer in terms of divine
41
The ritual instructions are identified on the tablet by the typical indicator in Sumerian, dù-dù-
bi, “its ritual action.” The ritual instructions are generally placed immediately after the last line
of the ritual wording.
42
This was historically a problem among Protestant interpreters, who could appeal to Matt 6:7–
8 to support their position.
43
There are, of course, cases of prayer in Mesopotamia in which the supplicants do await a
divine response (see, e.g., the tamitus). But this is due to the particular kind of prayer being
offered, one which accompanies an oracular extispicy.
44
Several examples of both situations can be found under the words magāru (CAD M/1, 38–39),
leqû (CAD L, 136–37), and šemû (CAD Š/2, 284–85), among others.18response or lack thereof. Indeed, the ancient Mesopotamians knew full well that
the gods were sovereign over the affairs of humans; the gods ultimately decided
if, when, and how a response to human supplication would occur (see Ludlul bēl
nēmeqi, for example). 45 But this need not contradict the fact that some (most?)
prayers seem to have worked, i.e., instilled good reason for the supplicant to
have confidence that positive results had been gained for their petitions, simply
by virtue of their being spoken. In other words, despite modern misgivings about
inconsistency, the involvement of a personal, benevolent agent need not have
ruled out a genuine confidence in the efficaciousness of a prayer. 46 In fact, some
ritual instructions for prayers actually state that after a specified number of reci-
tations of the text the supplicant’s prayer would be heard (see, e.g., Gula 1a, line
28 on page 252). Such a statement can plausibly be interpreted as intended to
instill confidence in the supplicant. 47 (Of course, this confident expectation
clashed sometimes with lived reality and resulted in dashed hopes and deep des-
pair, as we see in Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 1–48. The sufferer does everything right
but sees nothing but wrong around him!) These points should again caution us
from drawing an overly-precise conceptual distinction in ancient Mesopotamia
between impersonal ritual speech directed at malevolent (or other kinds of) enti-
ties and ritual speech directed at personal and benevolent agents (i.e., what we
are calling prayer).
If this discussion has somewhat blurred the conceptual line between the
forms of ritual speech that are often called “incantation” by modern scholars and
the present category of “prayer” (including what modern scholars call “incanta-
tion-prayers”) then it is has achieved its purpose.
It would, however, be a mistake, I think, simply to dissolve the conceptual
boundaries between all Mesopotamian texts that the present definition identifies
as prayers and all Mesopotamian texts that follow the scribal én superscript.
Though some of the texts called prayers here are identified by the Mesopotami-
ans as an én (thus the modern label “incantation-prayer”), there are many other
texts that the present definition would identify as a prayer but do not bear the
én label (e.g., the OB ikribu-like prayer, the NB royal prayer, and the OB letter-
prayer, to name three in this volume). Maintaining a distinct category of prayer

See also the very interesting tamitu-prayer in which the supplicant queries Shamash and Adad
regarding whether or not his penitential prayer (šigû) will be accepted by the gods. The reply,
which is not preserved, would have been given via extispicy. See W. G. Lambert, Babylonian
Oracle Questions, no. 8, rev. For Ludlul, see Amar Annus and Alan Lenzi, Ludlul bēl nēmeqi: The

based on a modern definition, therefore, helps one analytically by identifying
and including these other, similar texts for study within the dataset. (At the
same time, of course, one must keep in mind that the Mesopotamians themselves
may have been baffled by such a lumping together of what to their minds were
probably distinct groups of texts.) Furthermore, even among those texts catego-
rized as prayers by the definition that do in fact bear the én label, there are for-
mal features that mark a conceptual distinction between them and other forms
of ritual speech (such as incantations directed against malevolent powers) that
bear the én label. This calls for a brief explanation.
If one surveys the various texts scholars call incantations, that is, the many
texts bearing the scribal rubric én or én-é-nu-ru, one can generally see two op-
posing formal characteristics that distinguish incantation-prayers from the other
incantation texts: the first concerns how the texts begin; the other, how the texts
end. First, incantation-prayers invoke a supra-human power near the beginning
of the text who will help, it is assumed, the supplicant achieve a favorable result
for their petitions—a benevolent supra-human power. Non-prayer incantations,
on the other hand, may announce at the beginning to what or whom the incan-
tation addresses itself, but the addressee is not invoked to help achieve the
speaker’s expressed desires. Rather, the addressee is usually told what to do. Alt-
hough incantation-prayers may use imperatives, they do so typically within a
framework that begins (and often ends) with praise, a sign of deference; the im-
peratives in these texts, therefore, have quite a different tone than the ones in
non-prayer incantations. This is an important formal difference that hints at a
conceptual distinction. This distinction is clarified by the other formal character-
istic. 48
The second formal characteristic lies in the way the speaker of an incanta-
tion gained help for their ritual speech’s effectiveness: help came in the form of
legitimation formulae, generally attached at the conclusion of an incantation, in
which the incantation was asserted to be divine rather than human speech. The
most common Akkadian examples include šiptu ul yuttun (yattun), “the incanta-
tion is not mine,” šipat DN, “(it is) the incantation of [some deity],” ina qibīt DN,
48
A general survey—by no means exhaustive—of various terms for or used with supplication or
beseeching (atnu, emēqu [Št], enēnu, ikribu, leqû, magāru, maḫāru, naqbītu, nīš qāti, qāta našû,
qibītu [see CAD Q, 246–47], sīpu, sullû [noun and verb], suppû [noun and verb], surāru, surruru,
šemû, šuʾillakku, tarsītu, tēmēqu, tēnīnu, teslītu, tespītu, unnīnu, utnēnu, and upna petû) showed that
when such was directed to non-humans—kings could also hear supplications—the non-humans
were always benevolent powers (such as deities), never malevolent ones (such as demons). The
distinction is rather clearly made in one text that describes the utukku-demon as ša teslītu lā
imaḫḫaru, “who does not accept prayer” (see CAD T, 370 [bilingual section], citing CT 17 36,
K.9272:14 and duplicates). We should, however, probably not expect perfect consistency as the
following illustrates. There are some instances in which Lamashtu, commonly believed to be a
demon, “accepts a prayer” (unnīna leqû, see CAD L, 136 for references). Despite her malevolency,
Lamashtu was considered to be a deity, the daughter of Anu, in ancient Mesopotamia (see Black
and Green, 115–16). Despite this borderline case, it seems that the Mesopotamians generally
made a distinction between gods and demons when they used “prayer” words.20“by order of [some deity],” and DN šipta iddi/iqbi, “[some deity] cast/spoke the
incantation.” 49 These legitimation formulae were intended to raise the authority
of the ritual speech to the level of divine decree and thereby coerce the address-
ee to obey. As this volume shows, most incantation-prayers conclude with either
a petition or thanksgiving for the benevolent power’s favorable response. Only
very rarely does one see the legitimation formulae in incantation-prayers. For
example, there are only four instances of šiptu ul yuttun attached to an incanta-
tion-prayer, which makes these four quite exceptional among this very populous
category of texts. 50 See, likewise, Maqlû I 36 (see page 164), in which the suppli-
cant uses the ina qibīt formula to assert the accomplished defeat of the malevo-
lent witch. 51 These exceptions are reminders that cultural data rarely fit neatly
into compartmentalized categories. However, the fact that they are exceptional
examples bolsters the usefulness of the analytical generalization presented here.
From the above observations, it may be concluded that some ritual texts
modern scholars call incantations were generally construed as divine speech
while those identified as incantation-prayers generally reflect that of human
speech. 52 Even though this generalization is still simplistic, 53 it suggests there is
heuristic value to maintaining our modern category of prayer as a subset of
Mesopotamian ritual speech (see fig. 2).
One final question concludes this discussion of refining a definition of pray-
er and praise to fit the Akkadian material, namely, how do the communal and
institutional aspects of religious activity come to bear upon our understanding of Ak-
kadian prayer and praise?
As for the communal side of the issue, we do not know as much as we
would like about the actual Sitz im Leben of many prayers (see the descriptions
below). Based on the content of the ritual instructions that often follow the
wording of many prayers, however, the supplicant and the ritual expert seem to
have been the only people involved, at least usually, in the actual performance of
49
Sometimes this formula is expanded with –ma anāku ušanni/ašši, “and I repeated/bore (it).”

a ritual-prayer (i.e., reciting the text and performing the ritual actions that ac-
companied it). 54 Aside from certain kinds of royal prayers that may have in-
cluded a public element to them, ancient Akkadian prayers were not spoken in a
congregational setting; rather, they were individual. Despite the limited number
of people involved, such ritual-prayers were not necessarily private since they
may have been performed on a roof or beside a canal, although sometimes an
inaccessible place was prescribed. In any case, although ritual-prayers were in-
tended for individuals, they were hardly individualistic.
Who was present at or had access to the location of the ritual-prayer’s en-
actment is probably the least important element of the communal aspect of Mes-
opotamian prayer. The broader social embeddedness of the individual and the
manner in which this shaped their identity occupy a much more important role
in the proper understanding of ancient Akkadian prayers. The Mesopotamians
seem to have created personal identity primarily via their family, social posi-
tion/occupation, and city, among other things. 55 Even when praying alone (or
only with the ritual expert), these communal aspects of life were ever-present
concerns and therefore unsurprisingly impacted the kinds of petitions we find in
the prayers. For example, the ubiquitous petition for life (balāṭu) included more
than biological health or longevity; “life” encompassed the entire social and
physical well-being of the person, as is clear from the poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi. In
this doxological text the protagonist of the poem recounts how Marduk’s anger
resulted in his social alienation (I 41–104) and physical suffering (II 49–120).
When Marduk sent healing, the physical ailments were dispelled (III 68–line m)
and the sufferer was reintegrated into his community in a very public manner
54
In the case of prayers of the diviner, the supplicant and ritual expert were one and the same.
And in the cases of letter-prayers and royal prayers in building inscriptions, there are no ritual
experts involved. The generalizations in this paragraph will need adjustment according to the
specific kind of prayer one is reading.

See Karel van der Toorn, Family Religion in Babylonia, Syria, and Israel: Continuity and Change
in the Forms of Religious Life (SHCANE 7. Leiden: Brill, 1996).22(IV 38ff.). In fact, people marveled at his renewed well-being and praised the
gods for it (IV 70–82). Although there is much more one might say here, this one
examples illustrates the importance in becoming familiar with and keeping in
mind the broader communal and social contexts as one interprets ancient pray-
ers.
As for the institutional perspective, all of the texts that have come down to
us were preserved in writing by a group of elite, literate members of ancient
Mesopotamian society, the scribes. Most of the documents that the above defini-
tion of religion would identify as religious are not simple, workaday scribal texts
such as letters, account summaries, or receipts. Rather, they are complicated
texts that demonstrate linguistic sophistication, contain theological erudition,
and would have required ritual expertise for their proper execution (such as the
performance of an extispicy, the making of figurines, the setting up of altars,
etc.). The scribes/ritual experts that composed and used these texts were likely
therefore not normal scribes but masters of the scribal craft (Akk. ummânū),
well-educated in the traditional cuneiform curricula. Most of them would have
worked for one or both of the great institutions of their day: the royal palace
and the temples. It follows that the composition and preservation of much of the
material treated in this volume was due to the patronage/support of the king
and/or the temples. Furthermore, judging from the content of the prayers and
hymns, their most common kinds of findspots (e.g., palaces and temples), and
clues from texts such as royal letters, the king was the most important, though
certainly not the exclusive, user/beneficiary of these prayers and hymns.
The three most important institutional groups of scholars/ritual experts
with regard to the Akkadian prayers and hymns in this volume are the diviners
(bārû), the exorcists (āšipū), and the cult-singers (kalû). Although they were
working in earlier times (see, e.g., the two OB prayers of the diviner in this vol-
ume), our best evidence for these three professions comes from first millennium
tablets. From such texts we learn that these men—they were all men to the best
of our knowledge—served the king and temples via their learned corpora, in-
cluding many prayers that they believed derived from the gods themselves. 56
Thus, from an institutional rather than formal textual perspective many ritual-
prayers could also be considered divine speech because the gods had delivered
them to the institutional experts, who in turn performed them for and with the
supplicant—adapting them as necessary. 57 In order to contextualize specific

Understanding an ancient Mesopotamian prayer as both human (primarily) and divine speech
is akin to a theological understanding of Christianity’s most well-known prayer. The Lord’s Pray-
er was attributed to Jesus, who is traditionally identified as divinity incarnate; was recorded by a
biblical author in Scripture, which is traditionally believed to be divinely-inspired; and is prayed
by contemporary Christians on their own behalf. For a similar issue in contemporary Maya ritu-
als, see William F. Hanks, “Exorcism and the Description of Participant Roles,” in Natural Histo-
ries of Discourse (ed. Michael Silvertein and Greg Urban; Chicago: University of Chicago Press,I NTRODUCTION

priate, 58 in the descriptions offered below.

Having explored the definition of prayer presented in the first section of this
introduction and modifying it in light of the Mesopotamian material in the sec-
ond, this third section turns to consider the various classes that scholars have
recognized as examples of Mesopotamian prayer. Some of the classes discussed
below are recognized on the basis of ancient scribal labels and rubrics (e.g.,
shuillas, ikribus, and tamitus). Other classes are modern conventions, created
because scholars recognized certain thematic and/or structural similarities in the
texts (e.g., incantation-prayers, royal prayers, and letter-prayers). A com-
prehensive treatment of every class of Mesopotamian prayer in Akkadian is not

“all ritual speech in Maya could be construed as a sort of semiquote, insofar as shamans claim to
have learned its forms either from other shamans, from dreams, or in charismatic dialogues with
the very sprits they invoke in the third person. Shamans are not merely relayers of divine speech,
however, since they consciously change their prayer forms over time, in order to beautify them.”

The caveat “when appropriate” is necessary because not all prayers are attributable to one of
these three groups.

eral of the more important ones. 60
Incantation-prayers:
Because it is the largest group of prayers preserved in Akkadian and the best
represented class in this volume, the section begins with a lengthy and more
technical discussion of Akkadian prayers known broadly as the incantation-
prayer and considers the vexing issue of the relationship between the incanta-
tion-prayer and the shuillas, a very important member of the incantation-prayer
group in the history of scholarship. After sorting through this issue and present-
ing a full discussion of shuillas, two other kinds of incantation-prayers are more
briefly discussed, namely, the namburbi-prayers and the dingirshadibba-prayers.

So-called prayer names, that is, names of people that express petition, praise, or lament (e.g.,
Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur, “O Nabu, guard my firstborn,” Aššur-rabi, “Ashur is great!,” and Ātanaḫ-ilī, “I
have become weary, my god!”), are not treated in this introduction (see, e.g., von Soden,

Pluralismus in Israel und Babylon [Stuttgart: Calwer Verlag, 1978; repr., Atlanta: Society of Bibli-
cal Literature, 2005], 102–19). Although probably practiced in ancient Mesopotamia, this intro-
duction will also leave extemporaneous prayer out of consideration. See the brief comments by
von Soden in “Gebet II,” §7. See also the observation by Richard I. Caplice (The Akkadian Nam-
burbi Texts: An Introduction [SANE 1/1; Los Angeles: Undena, 1974], 12) that some instructions
for namburbi-rituals direct the supplicant to speak whatever is on their mind (expressed in Akk.

Whether one studies Mesopotamian prayers primarily within their own cul-
tural contexts or for comparative purposes, one will likely encounter shuillas.
The term shuilla is derived from a Sumerian rubric meaning “lifted hand(s)” that
functioned as a classifier of ritual-prayers. 61 Subscriptions to copies of such
prayers may include a shuilla-rubric, and both ritual instructions and descrip-
tions of ritual enactments may employ it to indicate the recitation of prayers of
this class. Gestures of lifted hands taken to express prayer or greeting are com-
mon in Mesopotamian figural art, and such gestures are attested in terms besides
those corresponding to this rubric. 62 Texts identified by a shuilla-rubric consti-
tute the best attested single category of Mesopotamian ritual-prayers. The term
“shuilla” refers to such ritual-prayers and the term “shuilla-prayer” refers explic-
itly to the texts to be recited. The present book includes eleven of them. Yet,
despite more than a century of modern scholarly investigation of texts bearing
this rubric, several fundamental problems bedevil the use of this term among
scholars and therefore require detailed attention. This introductory treatment
discusses each of the following, in turn:
(1) While three major classes of shuillas have been identified, scholars do not always
specify the one to which they are referring. This section offers a brief overview of the
evidence for these classes.
(2) Concerning the best attested of these classes, the Akkadian shuillas of the āšipu,
“exorcist,” a fundamental disagreement has arisen about whether the term shuilla
should be applied to texts not actually bearing this rubric but considered similar to
them. Because of this, it is often not apparent to what group of texts a given author
intends the term to refer. This section offers a summary of arguments on both sides of
the issue.
(3) Also concerning this best-attested class of shuilla, scholars disagree as to its pur-

This rubric, šu.íl.la (2) , combines the Sum. terms šu, “hand,” íl, “to lift,” and the nominalizing
element –a.
62
Various combinations of šu and íl (in some cases mu) and their corresponding Akkadian terms
qāta, “hand,” našû, “to lift,” and šuʾillakku, “lifted hands,” express a gesture of greeting/prayer
predicated of humans toward deities. Other idioms for such a gesture may be addressed to hu-
mans as well as to deities, e.g., ultu imittu karābu, “to greet with the right (hand),” and qāta elû,
“to raise the hand.”26pose and its defining characteristics. This section provides a detailed review of several
key issues and proposals.
(1) Three Classes of Shuillas: Three major classes of shuillas have been differ-
entiated based on the language in which the prayers are written and the ritual
expert associated with them. For each of these, some purpose and literary struc-
ture has been proposed. Yet, neither all occurrences of the rubric nor every
prayer labeled with it can be clearly associated with one of these classes or its
proposed purpose and structure. 63 Almost all shuillas have been associated with
one of two types of ritual expert, the kalû, “cult-singer,” or the āšipu, “exorcist.”
In Mesopotamian culture, in which adverse events were perceived as the result
of divine or demonic activity, the cult-singer was responsible for appeasing the
hearts of the angry gods by means of chanting lamentations and performing rites
of intercession; the exorcist was responsible for rituals offering prevention and
healing of illness, both spiritual and physical, as well as for effecting reconcilia-
tion between individuals and their personal deities, in effect preventing the pun-
ishments sent by the gods from taking full effect. 64
All known shuillas belonging to the craft of the cult-singer are in the Emesal
dialect of Sumerian. 65 These prayers probably originated in the public cult and
were performed, always one prayer to one deity, in the frame of an annual festi-
val, presumably at the end of a procession involving the statue of the deity ad-
dressed. They were recited in the first place to greet the deity. One type of them
was intended to calm the addressee, who immediately upon returning from a
cultic event interpreted as a battle, was caught up in a hostile mood.
In the craft of the exorcist, there are two major classes of shuillas distin-
guished, inter alia, by their language of composition, Akkadian or Sumerian. 66
Of the few shuillas of the exorcist written in Sumerian, a group of five were re-
cited in the Mīs pî (“washing of the mouth”) ritual, used for the animation of

Paul-Alain Beaulieu, “Late Babylonian Intellectual Life,” in The Babylonian World (ed. G. Leick;
New York: Routledge, 2007), 479. From a complementary perspective, Jean Bottéro associates
the cult-singer primarily with what he calls the theocentric cult, characterized by activities such
as feeding and offering of praise and luxury believed necessary to care for the gods, and the
exorcist primarily with what he calls the sacramental cult, characterized by activities concerned
with knowing the future and alleviating or preventing human suffering (Religion in Ancient Meso-
potamia [trans. T. L. Fagan; Chicago: University of Chicago, 2001], 114–202).

This paragraph summarizes conclusions found in Daisuke Shibata, “Ritual Contexts and Myth-
ological Explanations of the Emesal Šuilla-Prayers in Ancient Mesopotamia,” Orient 45 (2010),
67–85.
66
A few texts associated with the exorcist do not fit easily in either of these classes, including
some bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian as well as in monolingual Sumerian texts found in rituals
intended to dissolve evil fates, including rituals pertaining to dreams and namburbi-rituals.I NTRODUCTION

divine images. 67 This ritual spanned two days, and these five prayers were all
recited at the high point of the ritual. 68 Four of these prayers are preserved; they
range from nineteen to forty-seven lines in length, and their content concerns
the activity of the ritual. 69 It is widely recognized that shuillas in monolingual
Akkadian were employed in a variety of ritual contexts and in many cases ex-
plicitly request one of the “high gods” to intercede with the speaker’s angry per-
sonal gods. Yet, proposals for a fuller grasp of the Akkadian shuillas’ purpose
and defining characteristics remain under discussion and are treated in more
detail below.
(2) Incantation-prayer = or ≠ Shuilla? The best attested class of shuillas are
those written in Akkadian and belonging to the craft of the exorcist. 70 All of the
shuillas in the present volume fall into this category and are referred to simply
as “Akkadian shuilla-prayers.” They have been classified along with other Akka-
dian ritual-prayers of the exorcist that bear not the shuilla-rubric but other clas-
sifying rubrics on the basis of the following shared basic literary structure. 71
1. Address (including invocation and praise),
2. Petition (including lament), and
3. Thanksgiving/blessing.
The resulting genre is conventionally known as Gebetsbeschwörung, “incantation-
prayer.” 72 Assyriologists, however, do not agree on the application of the term
shuilla within this broad category, and this discrepancy of usage adds confusion

About eighty individual such prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric are attested in roughly two
hundred fifty (some quite fragmentary) exemplars (i.e., tablets). Roughly forty additional prayers
not attested with the rubric may have belonged to this class. See Mayer, UFBG, 375–435, and

these structural proposals in detail, see Mayer, UFBG, 35.
72
For a discussion of the various terms employed in scholarship, see Mayer, UFBG, 7–9.28to scholarship concerning this rubric, which is already complex. Two influential
studies have differentiated sub-genres of this broad class proceeding from a fun-
damental distinction among rubrics: the term shuilla, “lifted hand(s),” which has
long been recognized as indicating a gesture of prayer or greeting (King, BMS,
xix-xx), and other rubrics recognized as indicating specific purposes, for exam-
ple, the dissolution of an evil omen or of a spell. Since the classification systems
of both of these studies remain in use among scholars, both are summarized
briefly here.
Kunstmann’s study from the 1930s made the term shuilla synonymous with
incantation-prayer (see BGB). Two factors apparently contributed to this usage:
the idiomatic meaning of the shuilla-rubric was taken as synonymous with
“prayer” in a general sense, and yet this rubric appeared on prayers regarded as
belonging to different sub-genres of incantation-prayer. The term “incantation-
prayer” grew out of a clear distinction between prayer and magic: these texts
were seen as incantations in that they accomplished their goal, in part, magical-
ly by the recitation of powerful speech and the carrying out of actions, both
speech and act being believed effective in themselves; they were seen as prayers
in that they addressed petitions to one or more gods (Kunstmann, BGB, 3–4).
Each incantation-prayer was placed into one of three categories: “general,” “spe-
cial,” or “in-between” on the basis of two criteria: (1) purpose, either general or
specific; and (2) emphasis, either on its magical actions or on the prayer itself
and its offering. Most of those bearing the shuilla-rubric were considered “gen-
eral shuillas” chiefly because they lacked indicators of specific purpose. These
also tended to include little ritual activity besides an offering. “Special shuillas”
clearly specified a purpose and were often accompanied by more complex ritual
actions. Those bearing the shuilla-rubric and including a further specification of
occasion or purpose were in most cases classified as “in-between” (Kunstmann,
BGB, 70–72). 73
Mayer in the 1970s advocated that in order to respect its native usage
among incantation-prayers, the term shuilla should be employed exclusively to
refer to those prayers which are actually attested with the rubric or to those
which arguably would have born it (Mayer, UFBG, 7–8, 377). The present vol-
ume espouses this position. Other scholars, however, continue to use the term
shuilla to refer to the broader category. Avoiding the dichotomy between magic
and ritual, this later study defined incantation-prayers as ritual petition-prayers
of the individual, explaining that they are: (1) oriented to a ritual unit; (2) com-
prised of mostly pre-formulated petitionary speech of an especially powerful
type; and (3) combined with other specified ritual actions over all of which a
73
Kunstmann placed only two prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric in the “special” category, one
on the basis of a clearly specified purpose added to the rubric, and the other on the basis that it
had several characteristics of incantations for activating materials for ritual use (BGB, 5, 80–82).
The latter, Nisaba 1, is included in the present volume at page 351.I NTRODUCTION
29
ritual expert presided on behalf of an individual (Mayer, UFBG, 10–12, 22). 74
This study identified in these ritual-prayers a two-part core, an address with
names and a petition, and around this core it described the following structure,
the sequence of which may vary (adapted from Mayer, UFBG, 36–37):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
By expressing the deity’s greatness, power and goodness, those praying can
make these qualities ritually present (vergegenwärtigen).
The petition may be developed in multiple respects or can be embedded in the
context of a motivating clause. If the petition is motivated by distress, it can be
expressed in the form of a “lament” and thereby appeal to the mercy of the god.
Petitioners may articulate before the god what they do in carrying out the pray-
er and ritual: namely that they turn to the god pleading, or that they have
brought certain “advance payment” in the form of sacrifices and gifts.
The petition referring to a specific concern may be preceded by a petition for the
merciful attention of the deity, and it may be extended by a petition for other
concerns.
An “offer to perform,” i.e., the promise to praise the divinity for that god’s help
or the wish that others do so, may follow the petition and serve also to help mo-
tivate the divinity.
Those praying may introduce themselves by name and suitable epithets in the
parts of the prayer which refer to themselves.
The expert responsible for the sequence of the petition ritual may intervene in
the prayers of petitioners or speak for the petitioners’ concerns.
Of all incantation-prayers the best attested are namburbis and Akkadian
shuillas, treated in detail below. Others served various purposes, including free-
ing a person from malignant powers or events such as sickness, demons, witch-
craft, and bad dreams. 75 One ought to recognize the apparent creativity and flu-
74
Given the continued disagreement on this issue, it is confusing when scholars offer Mayer’s
definition of an incantation-prayer in order to explain what a shuilla is. See, e.g., Sally A. L.
Butler, Mesopotamian Conceptions of Dreams and Dream Rituals (AOAT 258; Münster: Ugarit-
Verlag, 1998), 130.
75
Mayer distinguished three major sub-types of incantation-prayers: shuillas, namburbis and
prayers serving to free a person from malignant powers; beyond these he identified an array of
smaller groups, though he stressed that these should not be taken as an exhaustive listing (UFBG,
13–18). The smaller groups concern the dissolution of unclear or bad dreams, the fending off of
field pests, shigu-prayers (petitions for absolution from sin), and blessings for houses and build-
ings. Mayer did not include dingirshadibba-prayers, which are treated below, in his study, point-
ing out that they do not seem to have a unified literary form (ibid., 16–17). One class of texts for
which Mayer creates a separate listing in UFBG (432–35) but which he does not discuss as a sub-
genre of incantation-prayer in the introduction to that study are Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Assyri-
ologists coined this classifier to designate incantations addressed to materials used in rituals and
intended to activate, enhance, and elicit the qualities of the materials (Kunstmann, BGB, 80; I.
Tzvi Abusch, “Blessing and Praise in Ancient Mesopotamian Incantations,” in Literatur, Politik
und Recht in Mesopotamien: Festschrift für Claus Wilcke (ed. W. Sallaberger, K. Volk, and A. Zgoll;
Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003], 1–14, here 2). Under Mayer’s definition of the core of incanta-
tion-prayers—address of a deity with petitions—such texts could be considered incantation-
prayers if they include both of these elements and to the extent that the materials addressed are30idity with which purposes could be constructed and combined. For instance, one
namburbi is for dissolving “evil that can cling to someone because of the magi-
cal manipulations of witches” and so associates the general purpose of nambur-
bis, to dissolve evil fate, with defense against the malignant power of witchcraft
(see Maul, ZB, 445). 76 Moreover, Akkadian shuillas were in many cases carried
out in conjunction with namburbis (see Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers,
§6). Aside from namburbis, dingirshadibbas, and Akkadian shuillas, all other
incantation-prayers are referred to simply as such in the present volume.
(3) Akkadian Shuillas: Even if one accepts the position that the shuilla-rubric
marks a particular class of ritual petition-prayers of the individual, as does the
present volume, one must recognize a range of scholarly opinion regarding the
distinguishing characteristics and purpose of Akkadian shuillas. The present dis-
cussion clusters around the interpretation of four aspects of these ritual-prayers:
the shuilla-rubric; typical and distinctive characteristics of the prayers; essential
elements of the ritual activity associated with them; and the rationale and pur-
pose of these ritual-prayers as a whole.
Recognizing that the term “shuilla” refers to a gesture of greeting or prayer,
most translators either render it literally as “lifted-hand” or translate it “prayer”
or “petition-prayer.” 77 As already noted, by contrast to other rubrics that convey
more specific purposes, the prayers bearing the shuilla-rubric tend not to be as-
signed to a ritual having a specific purpose (Kunstmann, BGB). In fact, one
scholar has taken this rubric to mark a non-category of ritual-prayers, those hav-
ing no specific purpose. 78 Interpreted as “prayer” or “petition-prayer,” one could
imagine the shuilla-rubric applying to the entire genre of incantation-prayer.
However, the linguistic features of Akkadian shuilla-prayers demonstrate a
seen to represent recognized deities or personified objects. See the incantation-prayer to Salt,
page 189 in this volume.

book.
77
In translating the rubric as “petition-prayer,” Mayer follows Franz Kraus (UFBG, 7). Zgoll
prefers the literal translation (Annette Zgoll, Die Kunst des Betens: Form und Funktion, Theologie
und Psychagogik in babylonisch-assyrischen Handerhebungsgebeten zu Ištar [AOAT 308; Münster:
Ugarit-Verlag, 2003, passim]). While stressing that the rubric marks prayers with distinctive
characteristics and not just any prayer at all, Zgoll views the shuilla-rubric as supplying an over-
arching category “prayer” when combined with other rubrics (Die Kunst des Betens, 21–22).
However, she has not taken up the issue of the distinctiveness of shuillas as a class in detail.
Frechette rejects interpretation of this rubric as synonymous with “prayer.” See his “Reconsider-
ing ŠU.IL 2 .LA (2) as a Classifier of the Āšipu in Light of the Iconography of Reciprocal Hand-Lifting
Gestures,” in Proceedings of the 51st Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale Held at the Oriental
Institute of the University of Chicago, July 18–22, 2005, (ed. R. Biggs, J. Myers, and M. Roth; SAOC

number of distinctive tendencies as compared with the other incantation-
prayers, including the following: 79

•
They employ elevated speech befitting the formality of an audience.
They include petitions to reconcile client and personal gods.
They include petitions for health and well-being stated in general terms while
being adaptable to specific occasions. 80
The basic structure of and rationale for Akkadian shuillas manifest the concept
of an “audience,” a fundamental situation of ancient Near Eastern culture con-
cerning ceremonies for a meeting in which someone presents a request to some-
one of a higher social status. 81 Noting that other Mesopotamian ritual-prayers
also reflect such a rationale, one scholar argues that the shuilla-rubric itself of-
fers a key to the distinctive rationale for these ritual-prayers. Preferring a literal
translation of the shuilla-rubric, he interprets its idiomatic meaning as concrete-
ly grounded in a formal gesture of greeting appropriate when entering the court
of a god or king and analogous to a military salute in that it demonstrates
recognition of an asymmetrical relationship between the subordinate who offers
the gesture and the one of higher status who receives it and who may have been
understood to offer a reciprocal gesture of some kind. 82 The following schema
for Akkadian shuillas is followed by a detailed discussion of each section: 83
79
These findings of Mayer are not summarized in UFBG, but they are discussed by Frechette
(Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §4). Mayer provisionally characterized shuilla-prayers as con-
cerned in a general way with a good human condition, liberation from what is life-threatening,
and attainment of what supports life (UFBG, 13). Such characterization, however, assumes a
form-critical stance that is overly confident in the capacity of a type of text considered original
to disclose the function of a genre. In thus characterizing shuilla-prayers, he discounted the
many cases in which rather specific petitions have been added to a given exemplar.
80
Noting that many particular exemplars of the canonical form of a given prayer are adapted for
specific occasions, Frechette considers such adaptability a defining characteristic of shuillas
(Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §§4, 6, 7).

82
See Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §2. He acknowledges there that notions of prayer,
blessing, and greeting are closely related in Mesopotamian culture, as can be seen in that the
same term (karābu) can express all three. On this point, see the landmark article by Benno
Landsberger, “Das ‘gute Wort,’” in Altorientalische Studien: Bruno Meissner zum sechzigsten Geburts-
tag am 25. April 1928 (Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1928–1929), 294–321.
83
This schema and discussion represent a modification of the work of Zgoll (Die Kunst; “Audi-
enz”; and “Für Sinne, Geist und Seele: Vom konkreten Ablauf mesopotamischer Rituale zu einer
generellen Systematic von Ritualfunktionen,” in Ritual und Poesie: Formen und Orte religiöser
Dichtung im alten Orient, im Judentum und im Christentum [ed. E. Zenger; Freiburg im Breisgau:
Herder, 2003], 25–46) and that of Frechette (“Reconsidering”; and Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers).32• Setting:
o They are addressed to a single high-ranking deity (rarely to multiple deities
as a collective).
o While they could be performed as units in isolation, they were certainly
performed in immediate conjunction with other ritual procedures in many
cases.
o They usually take place outdoors at night or in early morning in order to
address the deities in their astral aspects.
• Essential Elements (to which others may be added):
o Purification of the place (often by sweeping and sprinkling with water)
o Offerings, which usually include the burning of aromatics and pouring of
libations and may include food offerings
o Hand-lifting gesture(s) and prostration or kneeling of the client
o Triple recitation of the specified text to the deity, which typically empha-
sizes an eloquent address
Rationale and Purpose:
o The rationale of reciprocity operative in an audience determined that by
accepting the offerings, gestures, and speech of the subject, the superior be-
ing addressed was to some degree obliged to respond favorably to the re-
quest for assistance. Through this ritual, one sought to (re-)establish such a
reciprocal relationship with the deity, but the deity was regarded as free to
accept or to refuse.
o The shuilla-rubric names the entire ritual by highlighting as its central ac-
tion the hand-lifting gesture, which in a condensed and apt way signals to
the deity simultaneously the client’s submission and expectation of favora-
ble recognition and response to petition.
•
Prior to discussing the specific points of this schema, it should be noted that
all ritual instructions preserved in connection with prayers should be regarded
as aids to memory rather than comprehensive or exact indicators of what was
enacted. For instance, it has been observed that some ritual actions were consid-
ered so obvious that they were taken for granted and not specified in written
instructions. 84 Where multiple copies of a specific ritual of the exorcist are pre-
served, we may observe disparity among them in the amount of detail with
which ritual instructions are given as well as differences in the elements or order
of elements included. 85 Such differences may result in some cases from the varie-
ty of purposes for which a given tablet may have been copied, for example, for
84
Stefan Maul notes that while Kultmittelbeschwörungen incantations intended to activate the
effectiveness of various materials used in rituals, e.g., water and flour, are well attested in other
rituals, they are with one exception not attested in any instructions for namburbi-rituals (ZB, 33,
n.67). He explains this omission by suggesting that such incantations were so self-evident to the
expert that they did not need to be written (ibid., 33).
85
Maul has shown that different copies of the same ritual might provide details in different
degree, from a more elaborate “handbook” style, perhaps intended to instruct the beginner, to a
much more laconic style which regarded a greater number of actions as self-evident (ibid., 96–
97).I NTRODUCTION
33
archival purposes, for enactment on a specific occasion, or within a certain ritual
context, as an amulet or votive, or as a demonstration by an apprentice that he
had mastered a given text. 86 Among those copies of shuilla-prayers containing no
ritual instructions at all, some bear colophons indicating that they were copied
for a specific ritual series. For instance, instructions citing the prayers by incipit
occur on the ritual-tablets of Bīt salāʾ mê, a ritual lasting several days for the
purification of the king that took place during the fall Babylonian New Year’s
festival. 87
Concerning the setting: Akkadian shuilla-prayers are directed primarily to
“high gods” (as opposed to “personal gods”). 88 While many shuilla-prayers in-
clude petitions for healing, they have been characterized as concerned to obtain
help in reconciling personal gods to the speaker. 89 Comparative analysis demon-
strates that petitions for intercession regarding such reconciliation occur with a
significantly higher frequency in shuilla-prayers than in other incantation-
prayers. 90 In the Bīt salāʾ mê ritual for the legitimation of the Babylonian king,
the sequence of shuilla-rituals is intended to gain the intercession of the many
high-ranking gods addressed with the king’s angry personal deities in order to
reconcile them with him. 91
All three major classes of shuillas are addressed to deities as individuals. 92
Considerable evidence demonstrates inclusion of Akkadian shuillas along-
side or within other rituals. 93 For instance, they were likely enacted routinely
with namburbis, and lengthy sequences of them are attested in elaborate royal
rituals such as Bīt salāʾ mê and Bīt rimki.
Concerning the essential elements: This organization of elements for Akkadian
shuillas is not restrictive, and much of it is not distinctive. The notion of peti-
tioning deities in the context of an audience with its necessary purificatory
preparations, offerings, gestures, and recitations may be observed in other Mes-

Zgoll describes these prayers as addressed especially to gods responsible for illness. However,
a number of the gods she cites in support of this point are addressed not in any known shuilla-
prayers but in other incantation-prayers (Die Kunst, 22, n.52 citing Nils Heeßel, Babylonisch-
assyrische Diagnostik [AOAT 43; Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, 2000], 83f.; but the note at 83, n.41

8734opotamian rituals, especially those designated as “meal or aromatic gift offer-
ings.” 94 Some Akkadian shuillas include elements not listed here, such as the
manipulation of materials (bricks, minerals, fabric) or the making of other ges-
tures (holding of objects, anointing of the client). 95
In only two extant exemplars (Nusku 7 and Ishtar 1) is it fairly clear that an
instruction specifies that a shuilla-prayer be recited in conjunction with a ges-
ture of hand-lifting. Nevertheless, in light of the rubric and of the practice of
scribes to dispense with noting obvious elements, it is likely that a gesture of
hand-lifting was assumed. 96
The instruction for a triple recitation of the text occurs in many cases and
was likely presumed. In the texts of the prayers, typically the address of the dei-
ty occupies a large portion of the total prayer and is expressed with heightened
rhetorical style. 97
Concerning the rationale and purpose: By means of this ritual-prayer one
sought to establish a reciprocal relationship with the deity addressed as was
typical of asymmetrical relationships in the ancient Near East; in such relation-
ships the one receiving the gifts, gestures, and prayers would be to some degree
obliged to respond favorably to the petitioner. 98 While the convention of reci-
procity certainly influenced perceptions of shuilla-rituals as effective for present-
ing petitions, the efficacy of Mesopotamian rituals derived primarily from their
perceived divine origin, and a favorable response to petitions included in them
could not be presumed. 99

potamien,” RlA 10 (2003–2005), 93–102, §7.2. Of the types of prayer included in the present
volume, this listing includes namburbis.
95
Zgoll’s discussion lists the burning of aromatics as an essential element separate from the
offering of libations and possibly foods (“Für Sinne,” 29–30). However, one well-attested, laconic
formula simply instructs either the setting up of a ritual arrangement (riksu) or a censer (nignak-
ku). Such an option is attested at least once in exemplars of fourteen different shuilla-prayers.
Since riksu here likely refers to an array of ritual paraphernalia including the censer, this formula
leaves open the possibility that in some cases only incense was offered. For discussion of this
instruction, see Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §5.
96
For a detailed discussion of the significance of the rubric and its implications for the ritual
activity accompanying these shuilla-prayers, see ibid., §§2, 3, 5. The gesture of lifted hand(s) is
mentioned in neither Zgoll’s discussion of the function of the procedures and words in these
rituals (“Für Sinne,” 27–43) nor in her sketch of the structure and elements of these rituals (“Au-
dienz,” 183–87). However, her comparison of the elements of shuilla-rituals with those of an
audience with a human ruler as portrayed in The Poor Man of Nippur asserts that such a gesture
was enacted and gave the ritual its name (“Audienz,” 189–97).

Claus Ambos offers the following summary of the operative worldview:
Mesopotamian techniques of ritual and divination were believed to have been trans-
mitted to man by the gods themselves, and they could never work against the will of
the gods nor force them to perform an action merely because it was desired by the
ritual’s human participants. The reason is that ritual was not effective in itself but de-I NTRODUCTION
35
The shuilla-rubric names the ritual by highlighting the hand-lifting gesture
as a central action, one likely presumed by the exorcists, and the rationale for
highlighting this gesture may be summarized as follows: 100 A gesture of lifted
hands expressed by terms corresponding to the shuilla-rubric is instructed for
various rituals, but for this one it was of central significance. That an element
occurring in various rituals could be the classifying rubric of a particular ritual
for which it held such significance is otherwise attested. 101 While offerings and
speech were essential to an audience, Akkadian shuillas emphasized the com-
municative gesture to which the shuilla-rubric refers, a salutation signaling
recognition of a reciprocal but asymmetrical relationship between client and
deity. 102 Given the lexical and visual evidence that such greetings were ex-
changed in a reciprocal manner, this gesture would have provided a particularly
apt ritual focus for expressing both the desire to (re-)establish such a relationship
with the deity and the anticipation of the deity’s acceptance of this relationship
and favorable response to the petitions presented. As already noted, the propor-
tion of text dedicated to formal address of the deity typically occupies up to half
of the text of the prayer. These shuilla-prayers did convey petitions and were
often recited in conjunction with other prayers expressing petitions, but their
ritual designation highlighted this formal gesture of greeting. In so doing, the
ritual focused on an action which in a condensed and apt way signaled to the
deity simultaneously the client’s willing submission and expectation of favorable
recognition and help. In this way, the petitions associated with these shuillas
were explicitly contextualized by this gesture which affirmed an asymmetrical
yet reciprocal relationship between petitioner and deity.
Additional specifications of purpose within either rubrics or ritual instruc-
tions, while rare, are attested among exemplars of Akkadian shuilla-prayers.
These may be seen as explicit statements of context within which the assistance
of the deity addressed was sought. 103
pended upon the gods’ collaboration. This concept could also account for occasional
ritual failure: the gods simply were refusing any communication with the human
sphere and were not inclined to accept a prayer or a ritual.
(“Ritual Healing and the Investiture of the Babylonian King,” in The Problem of Ritual Efficacy
[ed. W. Sax, J. Quack, J. Weinhold; New York: Oxford University Press, 2010], 17–44, here 17).
100
This explanation of this rationale follows Frechette, Mesopotamian Ritual-prayers, §§ 3, 7.
101
A particular ritual element, even one commonly attested among various rituals, was em-
ployed in some cases to name a particular ritual for which that element captured the central
significance. Claus Ambos discusses how this is the case for the sprinkling rite central to the Bīt
salāʾ mê, “house of sprinkling,” ritual as well as for the “mouthwashing” central to the Mīs pî
ritual, “mouth-washing” (Der König, §II.3.2). See also Dick, “Pīt Pī,” 581–82).
102
As noted above, these shuilla-rituals were addressed, like those of the other two recognized
classes mentioned above, almost exclusively to individual high-ranking deities.

Omens were important indicators of the will of the gods for the ancient
Mesopotamians and could manifest themselves in anything that was a) deemed
significant in their system of divination and b) observed by someone. Solicited
omens were obtained through human actions intent on finding signs as, for ex-
ample, in the case of liver divination (i.e., hepatoscopy, sacrificing an animal
and examining its liver to interpret the signs the gods had placed on it). Unsolic-
ited omens could take the form of a host of things one might observe in the
course of everyday life. Certain signs were deemed unfavorable and others were
favorable. The description of signs and their significance was expressed in an “if-
then” statement and recorded on tablets. The “if” clause is technically called the
protasis by scholars; the “then” clause is called the apodosis. In the course of
time, scribes compiled long lists of omens and arranged them thematically into
tablet series such as Shumma Alu, dealing with terrestrial omens, Shumma Izbu,
dealing with malformed births, and Enuma Anu Enlil, dealing with celestial
omens. It was believed that before a calamity happened, the gods might an-
nounce it with an evil omen. 105 The shape of a malformed animal fetus, the ap-
pearance of a lizard on the wall in one’s house, the movement of a planet, the
content of a dream—these and many, many other things could be understood as
104
Despite its size, Maul’s volume does not contain all known namburbi-rituals. He states that
his interpretations are based on both the published editions and on about two hundred other
namburbi-ritual fragments known to him (ZB, XII, n.11). Unfortunately, he does not list these
fragments systematically anywhere in the volume.
105
Not all omens were evil, however; some were interpreted as favorable. In the case of evil
omens counteracted by namburbi-rituals, Maul suggests that the Mesopotamians understood the
impending evil to have been the result of a human misdeed, committed by the one affected by
the omen, that had angered the gods (see “How the Babylonians Protected Themselves,” 124 and
ZB, 60).I NTRODUCTION
37
unsolicited evil signs. 106 According to Maul, these things are omen bearers; they
bore the evil of the omen to the person affected. 107
Despite the announcement of coming calamity, the one affected by the evil
omen did not have to resign themselves to its ravages. The execution of a nam-
burbi-ritual, performed by the exorcist for and with the person affected—often
the king but others as well, would avert the impending ill announced by an evil
omen before it happened and thereby return the affected person to normal
life. 108 Attested rituals counteract many different kinds of evil, as a perusal of
Maul’s table of contents will show (see ZB, VI–VII). For example, there are ritu-
als against evil omens associated with the behavior or specific observations of
birds, snakes, dogs, lizards, ants, and other animals, against the observation of
lightning, against the appearance of fungus in a house, against a specific time of
a child’s birth, against a lunar eclipse, and against chariot accidents while on
campaign, among others. The namburbi-ritual could be quite short or be carried
out over several days. If one is to judge from the ritual accoutrement involved
(e.g., precious metals, a host of food and drink offerings, and the fabrication of
figurines), some of the namburbi-rituals would have been very expensive and
taken days to prepare. 109 Whatever its cost, without a ritual response to release
or undo the evil portended by the omen, the evil that was announced, so it was
thought, would become a reality.
Namburbi-prayers comprise the class of incantation-prayer recited during
namburbi-rituals for the specific purpose, as the name suggests (the Sum. word
nam-búr-bi means “its releasing”), 110 of releasing the announced evil so it would
not actually harm the person affected by the appearance of the omen. 111 Not

There is much, much more to say about divination in ancient Mesopotamia. For a concise
overview, see A. K. Grayson, “Divination,” in Religions of the Ancient World: A Guide, 373–76 and
Jean Bottéro, Mesopotamia: Writing, Reasoning, and the Gods (trans. Zainab Bahrani and Marc van
de Mieroop; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), 125–37. A much fuller treatment is
presented in Stefan Maul, “Omina und Orakel. A. Mesopotamien,” RlA 10 (2003–2005), 45–88. It
should be noted that the omen collections were not merely observation-based collections. Ra-
ther, they underwent scholastic development and therefore often contain signs that would be
highly unlikely or impossible to ever observe (e.g., a seven-headed izbu or a lunar eclipse on,
say, the fifth day of a lunar month).
107
For a summary of Maul’s view of the “omen bearers,” see pages 357 and 407.
108
That namburbi-rituals fell within the professional and institutional domain of the exorcist is
clear from KAR 44, rev. 6 (and parallels), the so-called Vademecum of the Exorcist, where nam-
burbi-rituals are listed among the texts an exorcist must master. See M. J. Geller, “Incipits and
Rubrics” in Wisdom, Gods, and Literature: Studies in Assyriology in Honour of W. G. Lambert (ed. A.
R. George and I. L. Finkel; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 225–58 for the most recent edition.
109
See Maul, ZB, 29–36 for a presentation of what can be gleaned about ritual preparations from
the royal correspondence of Neo-assyrian scholars and 39–47 for his reconstruction of prepara-
tions from the ritual instructions.
110
The Sumerian suffix –bi, “its,” in the name originally referred to the omen apodosis, the
“then” part of the omen entry that asserted the significance of the observed sign (see Maul, ZB,
12).
111
Although releasing evil was the usual purpose of namburbi-rituals, a very small minority
were intended for a positive purpose. For example, we have namburbi-rituals to bring about an38every namburbi-ritual required a namburbi-prayer, however, 112 and other kinds
of prayers may also have been required during the course of the ritual (e.g.,
shuilla-prayers and cult-material incantation-prayers or Kultmittelbeschwörung-
en). 113 When a prayer was prescribed by the ritual instructions—namburbi or
otherwise, it might appear as a full text embedded in the broader ritual context.
Sometimes, however, the instructions only cited the incipit, that is, the prayer’s
initial line; the remainder of the prayer would have been provided by the exor-
cist performing the ritual, presumably from memory or from another tablet.
A namburbi-prayer was only one part in a rather complex ritual process,
which is briefly summarized here in an idealized form. 114 After the exorcist pre-
pared the items needed for the ritual (e.g., holy water and figurines) and erected
an altar, 115 the people and places 116 involved in the ritual would be purified
(e.g., the one affected by the omen may wash in water). An offering of various
foods and drinks, which in fact constituted a meal, would be presented to the
gods involved in the ritual, typically Shamash, Ea, and Asalluḫi. 117 Incense may
also be burned during the meal. 118 With the preparations made for approaching
the gods and the mood for a favorable hearing achieved, the heart of the ritual
began: the removal of the impending evil from the one affected by the evil sign.
It is at this point in the ritual that the prayer would have been recited.
increase in trade for a business owner or other professional (see Caplice, Akkadian Namburbi
Texts, 9 and 23–24) and to overcome the estrangement of a couple who had been separated for a
time (see ZB, 409–14).
112
This point is easily verified by perusing the examples translated in Caplice, Akkadian Nam-
burbi Texts. As with all ritual instructions, however, the possibility must be considered that not
everything that was to be done in a namburbi-ritual was actually written on the tablet. In some
cases, the ritual instructions may have presumed the exorcist knew what (else) there was to do.

eclipse, see page 386, n.7 and the references there. For cult-material prayer-incantations, as
stated earlier, we must presume they were recited during namburbi-rituals from memory by the
exorcist since they were not incorporated into the actual instructions (with one exception). See
Maul’s statements in ZB, 33 with n.67, 107 with n.8, and 375, 377, line 12ʹh for the exception).
114
This summary is idealized because not every element in it is attested in every namburbi-
ritual, and there is no attempt here at an exhaustive listing of the great variety in ritual details.
For the variety of ritual actions, see Maul’s thorough treatment in ibid., 39–113 and the much
briefer overview in Caplice, Akkadian Namburbi Texts, 9–12.

See ZB, 39–47.

The ritual could take place in a variety of settings such as the roof of a house, the bank of a
canal, or where the omen manifested itself. But it is not uncommon for the instructions to de-
scribe the location only vaguely: a secluded place in the steppe (ina ṣēri parsi) or some other
inaccessible locale (ašar šēpu parsat, lit. “a place where the foot is barred”; see ibid., 48).

Caplice, remarking on the burning of aromatics, writes, “it is clear that burning them on a
censer was part of the normal banquet situation among human beings in the Neo-Assyrian peri-
od, so that their use in rituals providing a divine banquet was natural” (Akkadian Namburbi
Texts, 11). Note also the similarity to the meal-related activities as described in the OB ikribu-
like prayer, line 11ff. (see page 90).I NTRODUCTION

Formally, namburbi-prayers follow the typical outline of other incantation-
prayers. 119 That is, they begin with an invocation and praise of the deity or dei-
ties involved. As noted above, Shamash, god of justice, is the god predominantly
invoked, often along with Ea and Asalluḫi, gods of wisdom and magic. 120 The
reason for this, according to Maul, is that
[e]ven if the great gods Ea, Šamaš, and Asalluhi, whom the conjuror had sum-
moned, were not the divinities who had sent the . . . omen, they had at the very
least allowed the person to be burdened with that fate. Only when the person
involved had convinced the gods, especially Šamaš, the god of law (kittu) and
justice (mīšaru), that the impending, evil fate would befall him unjustly, could
the sinister power of the harbinger . . . be broken. 121
After the introduction, the prayers turn to a description of the problem (lament)
and the request for its resolution (petition). The lament often includes a descrip-
tion of the sign (ina/aššu lumun X, “on account of the evil of X”) and how it af-
fected the supplicant, typically stated as palḫāku adrāka u šutādurāku, “I am
afraid, anxious, and constantly in fear.” 122 The petition part of the namburbi-
prayer is invariably concerned with requesting the deity to avert the impending
evil from the supplicant and to make the evil keep its distance. The prayers gen-
erally conclude with a brief promise of praise.
The ritual instructions typically complement the petitions of the prayer via
the actions prescribed against the omen bearer or, as is often the case, its substi-
tute in the form of a figurine. 123 The evil was transferred symbolically to the
omen bearer/substitute in some way (e.g., the water used to purify the suppli-
cant was poured over the omen bearer) 124 and then eliminated (e.g., the omen
bearer or its substitute was tossed into the river, placed on a boat going down-
stream, or carried off by a fish or bird). 125 After another rite of purification, 126
the supplicant might be told, for example, to return home, go to another place,
or to enter a tavern, being careful not to look back or to return on the same path
by which they had come. 127 Sometimes the supplicant would also be required to
wear an amulet necklace for a prescribed number of days. 128
119
In fact, Mayer (UFBG, 35) uses a namburbi-prayer, Shamash 25 (see page 421) as an example
of the typical structure of an incantation-prayer in the introduction to his study.
120
Other gods could be invoked in prayers, too (e.g., Naru, “the deified River,” and Ishtar).

“How the Babylonians Protected Themselves,” 125.
122
Although other incantation-prayers use these formulae, they are found very frequently in
namburbi-prayers. See Mayer, UFBG, 73–74.
123
As Maul mentions, a few namburbis require the use of a figurine of the one affected by the
omen—the supplicant themselves. This substitute then receives the evil and symbolically suffers
its effects instead of the real person. See ZB, 74–75.

128
See ibid., 107–13.40As one might surmise from the prominence of Shamash, god of justice, in
the ritual recitations, namburbi-rituals are permeated with legal language. De-
spite the legal imagery’s importance, it is probably overstepping the bounds of
evidence to suggest, as does Maul, that the namburbi-ritual is patterned exclu-
sively on a legal trial, 129 ending with a river ordeal for the evil bearer. 130 As
Veldhuis points out, the legal imagery is an important perspective to keep in
mind while interpreting the namburbis but not all examples fit this model as
well as others. 131 For example, not all namburbis end with the evil bearer being
cast into the river (see Maul, ZB, 89–90). Moreover, focus on the legal aspects
may lead to neglecting other useful perspectives.
Although there are a couple of Akkadian and Hittite tablets from Hattusha
that preserve rituals of releasing evil, suggesting OB forerunners for namburbi-
ritual texts, by far our most numerous sources for namburbi-rituals come from
first millennium sites in Babylonia and Assyria and are written in SB Akkadi-
an. 132 The textual witnesses to namburbi-rituals come down to us in various
forms: some rituals appear in the omen tablets themselves as a brief insertion
after the related omens that the namburbi-ritual counteracts; a couple of rituals
are part of a larger medical-ritual compendium that includes various other texts;
many namburbi-rituals are preserved individually on a tablet, one ritual per
tablet; others are transmitted on Sammeltafeln, that is, tablets that collect a num-
ber of namburbi-rituals, which may or may not be thematically organized; final-
ly, some namburbi-rituals are preserved on amulets, suggesting that even the
inscribed tablet itself had apotropaic effectiveness. 133 According to Maul, evi-
dence suggests that namburbi-rituals were arranged into a series of at least 136
tablets for Ashurbanipal’s library. Unfortunately, evidence is currently too sparse
to reconstruct the series. 134 Letters from Assyrian and Babylonian scholars to the
king, however, provide important evidence for the preparation and actual execu-
tion of namburbi-rituals in the Assyrian capital. 135

of this writing.} Karel van der Toorn. Sin and Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia: A
Comparative Study. Assen: Van Gorcum, 1985, 121–24. {A brief look at the ritual set-
ting and purpose of these prayers.} Margaret Jaques at the University of Zurich is
publishing a fuller edition and study of the dingirshadibbas, including the prayers and
their rituals. Her study will also address their reception history and reuse, too.
Dingirshadibba-prayers take their name from the Sum. rubric that some-
times occurs at their conclusion: ka-inim-ma dingir-šà-dib-ba gur-ru-da-kam, “it
is the wording for appeasing (lit. turning back) an angry god.” 136 Because the
wording of the prayer is often preceded by the én superscript modern scholars
refer to them as incantation-prayers. As the name dingirshadibba suggests, these
incantation-prayers were used for penitential purposes; that is, they were prayed
when one needed to turn back the wrath of a god. Like the other Akkadian in-
cantation-prayers discussed above, the dingirshadibba-prayers were part of the
professional sphere of the exorcist (see KAR 44, obv. 4 and parallels). 137 Themat-
ically, the dingirshadibbas are not distinctive since several other kinds of prayers
were also intended to appease the anger of various gods (e.g., ershaḫunga-
prayers 138 and the still rather poorly known shigu-prayers 139 ). What is distinctive
about the dingirshadibba-prayers is the deity to whom they were typically di-
rected: the personal deity. 140 (For more on personal deities, see page 431.)
Because the supplicant was quite familiar with the addressee, many of the
dingirshadibba-prayers have a more intimate and personal tone than the other
kinds of prayers in this volume. The opening may exemplify this tone best. 141
Rather than beginning the prayer with an invocation and a long string of epi-
thets that invoke, honor, and praise the deity being addressed, the dingirsha-
dibba-prayers typically begin with a very short invocation, sometimes as simple
136
The rubric does not occur in all of the examples that Lambert reconstructed. Some of the
prayers he treats in his edition were classified as dingirshadibba-prayers by content alone. His
edition, as he states, is tentative (“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 267). Jaques reads the third
sign of the prayer’s name as dab (see the lexical section of ṣabātu in CAD Ṣ, 6), thus, dingir-šà-
dab-ba. The meaning is, however, the same.
137
See footnote 108 above for the most recent edition of this text.
138
In fact, Lambert has shown that some texts he edits as dingirshadibbas were also known in
the form of bilingual and unilingual Sumerian ershaḫunga-prayers. See his lines 71–108 (“DING-
IR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 278–81, 288–93, and 297–304) and Maul, HB, 213–15. For more on
ershaḫunga-prayers, see page 43 below.
139
See Mayer, UFBG, 15 for the handful of prayers that falls into this small category and his
pages 111–13 for their characteristic features. The most recent treatment, with references to
literature since Mayer, is van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia, 117–21, with
a few texts treated in 125–36. See also the earlier work by M.-J. Seux, “Šiggayôn = šigû?” in
Mélanges bibliques et orientaux en l’honneur de M. Henri Cazelles (ed. A. Caquot and M. Delcor;
AOAT 212; Kevelaer: Butzon & Bercker / Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1981), 419–38.
140
As Lambert notes, the rubric is not applied in an entirely consistent manner to generic per-
sonal gods since occasionally a dingirshadibba-prayer addresses a high god such as Sin or Mar-
duk and Zarpanitu (“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” 268).
141
See Alan Lenzi, “Invoking the God: Interpreting Invocations in Mesopotamian Prayers and
Biblical Laments of the Individual,” JBL 129 (2010), 303–15.42as “my god” (ilī). When other epithets follow they often have some personal
connection to the supplicant. Lines 40–41 of Lambert’s provisional edition of the
dingirshadibbas provide a notable example in this respect, though the opening is
longer than is usual: ilī bēlī bānû šumīya nāṣir napištīya mušabšû zērīya, “my god,
my lord, ‘builder’ of my name, guardian of my life, creator of my progeny.” 142
Unlike the other classes of incantation-prayers, the dingirshadibba-prayers
do not show a common structure, although laments, petitions, and, in a few cas-
es, a promise of praise can be found variously in the prayers. Thematically, ding-
irshadibba-prayers are focused on the supplicant’s personal sin. Both confession
of sin and pleas of ignorance (in general and about sin specifically) dominate the
prayers, finding expression in direct statements (e.g., mādū arnūya ēma ēpušu ul
īde, “my iniquities are many! I do not know what I did!”), 143 questions (e.g., mīnu
annūya kīam epšēku, “what are my sins (that) I am treated thus?”), 144 and meta-
phors (e.g., alpu anākū-ma šammu ākulu ul īde, “I am an ox; I do not know the
plant that I eat.”). 145 One also finds various statements that assert the inherent
sinfulness of humanity and the remoteness of the divine realm, suggesting that
because sin is inevitable and the deity so remote human frailties should be ex-
cused. 146
We do not know whether the dingirshadibba-prayers were arranged into a
series as were the namburbis in Nineveh. There is at present no published colo-
phon evidence to go on. We do know, however, that the prayers were used with
various ritual actions 147 and in various ritual settings. As the evidence is still
rather thin, a fuller treatment of the ritual setting of these prayers must await
Margaret Jaques’ new edition in her Habilitation at the University of Zurich.
Lambert mentions the incorporation of dingirshadibba-prayers into Bīt rimki and
their apparent use in a ritual preserved on KAR 90 (which was followed by
Šurpu); but he was reticent to discuss the ritual setting of the dingirshadibbas
further because the evidence was “too incomplete and uncertain in every respect
for any overall view to be obtained.” 148 Karel van der Toorn offers a brief discus-
sion of some of the diverse occasions for the performance of these incantation-
prayers in the hopes that understanding “[t]he ritual Sitz im Leben of the indi-
vidual prayers may . . . furnish the key to a better comprehension of their place
in the more elaborate rituals” 149 (such as Bīt rimki). He believes the dingirsha-
dibbas were “designed for situations in which the general circumstances point to

the wrath of the personal gods,” 150 which is supported by the citation of a ding-
irshadibba in what he believes are diagnostic texts. After looking at some shared
terminology in the prayers and the diagnostic texts, he concludes that “the dingi-
ršadibbas with their rather vague rubrics represent the therapeutic counterpart of
the diagnostic texts.” 151 Sally Butler has noticed that prayers very similar to the
dingirshadibba-prayers (though the dingirshadibba-rubric is lacking) are pre-
scribed in what she calls the Ashur Dream Ritual Compendium, col. iv, lines 21–
30 and 31–41b. 152 These sections of the compendium are intended to induce a
pleasant dream (see lines 30 and 41b). Apparently, one impediment to a pleas-
ant dream was the anger of personal deities. Thus, it seems that the prayers were
used in this case to reconcile the gods to the supplicant prior to their going to
sleep.

An ershaḫunga-prayer (Sum. ér-šà-ḫun-gá), 155 as the name indicates, is a
“lament to appease the heart (of a god).” Although these prayers were originally
written in the Emesal dialect of Sumerian, most of the texts were provided with
an Akkadian interlinear translation. 156 The ershaḫunga-prayers show various
affinities with the Sumerian balags and ershemmas, 157 but they do not address

This brief introduction relies on Maul’s (HB, 1–72). The name of the prayer is always written
logographically in Akkadian contexts. Maul believes the loanword was probably more likely
written as eršaḫungakku than eršaḫungû (see ibid., 1, n.1 and compare CDA, 79).

15144political concerns or lament the destruction of a sanctuary. They, rather, are
spoken by an individual with personal concerns, ultimately, to appease an angry
god. Thematically, therefore, ershaḫunga-prayers are very similar to the ding-
irshadibbas. The ershaḫungas differ conspicuously, however, from the ding-
irshadibba-prayers in several respects: the ershaḫunga-prayers belong to the
corpus of the cult-singer (kalû), they do not begin with the én superscript, they
show a common structure, and they are not exclusively directed to the personal
god.
Maul’s edition of the ershaḫungas presents the text of over one hundred for-
ty different prayers, many of which are fragmentary. 158 Although the divine ad-
dressee of some of these prayers is impossible to determine due to damage on
the tablet, there are prayers attested for many well-known high deities such as
Anu, Aya, Ishtar, Enlil, Ninlil, Nusku, Damkina, Ea, Sin, Shamash, Marduk, Ni-
nurta, Zarpanitum, and Tashmetum, among others, as well as prayers to other
gods, such as the ones directed to a personal god 159 and to “any god” (included
in this volume, see page 447). Although the form goes back to OB times, 160 most
of the currently known prayers come from the first millennium and were discov-
ered in the remains of Ashurbanipal’s library in Nineveh, though other sites have
yielded some prayers, too. 161
The ershaḫunga-prayers exhibit a common structure. 162 Each prayer begins
with an introductory litany, which has four thematic variations: 163 praise (e.g.,
bēlum puluḫtaka galtat, qarrādu abu Adad puluḫtaka galtat “O lord, your terror is
frightening! O hero, father Adad, your terror is frightening!”); 164 wooing (e.g.,
anāku ana bēlīya taṣlītum luqbīšu, qarrādu abu Adad taṣlītum luqbīšu, “I will speak
a prayer to my lord, the hero, father Adad, I will speak a prayer!”); 165 petitioning
(e.g., ša bēlim nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra, “may the anger of the lord’s heart

158
Due to their partial preservation, some of these prayers may turn out to belong to another
genre.
159
Lambert treated the text as a dingirshadibba-prayer, but he also recognized that some MSS
labeled the text an ershaḫunga (see footnote 138 above).
160
See Maul, HB, 9–10 for a short list of OB prayers with close affinities to the first millennium’s
ershaḫunga-prayers. See also his edition of BM 29632 (with references to the secondary litera-
ture, 10–15), which bears the ershaḫunga rubric. (The tablet was originally recognized and pub-
lished by Piotr Michalowski, “On the Early History of the Ershahunga Prayer,” JCS 39 [1987],
37–48. On the basis of this tablet, Michalowski proposed to identify a number of OB prayers as
ershaḫungas [42–43]).

return to normal” [or “relent,” lit. “return to its place”], see page 449), 166 or
lamenting (e.g., anāku ana bēltīya mīnâ ēpuš, “what have I done to my lady?”). 167
The lament follows this opening litany and occupies a prominent place in
the text. The lament typically describes the effect of suffering upon the suppli-
cant’s body but details are usually lacking, making the prayers applicable to
many situations. According to Maul’s interpretation of the laments, “the de-
scribed symptoms such as tears, tremors, moans, sleeplessness, debilitation,
grief, and depression are not to be seen as the actual complaint, but rather as
secondary evils.” 168 These symptoms are the results of something deeper, name-
ly, the supplicant’s offense against the deity. Thus, one finds confessions of sin
(and ignorance) and requests for forgiveness in the lament section of the er-
shaḫungas, which often look similar to what one finds in the dingirshadibba-
prayers (see above, page 40). In the transition between the lament and the peti-
tion one may find the description of a ritual act of the supplicant similar to what
Mayer calls a Hinwendung, a “turning” 169 (e.g., kneeling, calling out, kissing the
feet of the deity, etc.). In conjunction with the supplicant’s confession of sin,
these acts often have a penitential character. 170
The petition follows upon the lament, as it does in the incantation-prayers.
In this section the supplicant calls upon the deity to remedy the breach in their
relationship and to bring the supplicant’s suffering to an end. It is common for
this section to begin with a mention of the word that the supplicant wishes the
deity to speak, the word that could put an end to the supplicant’s tribulation:
aḫulap, “(it is) enough!” Like the incantation-prayers, the supplicant may peti-
tion the deity for forgiveness of sins, renewed attention, and/or restoration of
health and well-being. 171 Between the petition and the next section, the interces-
sory litany, many ershaḫunga-prayers have a promise of praise.
In the intercessory litany the supplicant calls on their personal deities as
well as deities related to or associated with the primary deity invoked in the
prayer (e.g., if Enlil is invoked, one will find Ninlil, his wife, and Nusku, his vi-
zier, called upon in this section, among others). 172 The supplicant seeks the help
of these other gods in securing the divine appeasement of the primary deity ad-
dressed in the prayer, sometimes requesting that the intercessory deities speak a
prayer on the supplicant’s behalf.

16746The final section is aptly called the “concluding formula” (Die Eršaḫunga-
Schlußformel) and appears in all but one ershaḫunga-prayer treated by Maul (the
exception is his no. 47). It reads in Sumerian as follows:
šà-zu šà-ama-tu-ud-da-gim ki-bi-šè ḫa-am-gi 4 -gi 4
ama-tu-ud-da a-a-tu-ud-da-gim ki-bi-šè ḫa-am-gi 4 -gi 4

May your heart, like the heart of the mother who gave birth (to me) return to
normal,
Like the mother who gave birth (to me), the father who engendered (me), may
it return to normal.
The prayers currently attested are written on one-column tablets with one
prayer per tablet. There are no ritual instructions included on the tablets attest-
ing ershaḫunga-prayers. However, there are other tablets consisting of ritual
instructions that prescribe the use of ershaḫunga-prayers in various ritual com-
plexes. These ritual instructions often include the recitation of balags and
ershemmas before the recitation of the ershaḫunga-prayers. 174 The ritual texts
have both cultic and apotropaic purposes. The latter, according to NA letters
from scholars, are always connected to the king. It seems plausible to presume,
however, based on the individualistic content of the prayers, that the prayers
may have (also?) been used, originally, at least, by private citizens. But there is
currently no evidence to support this.

The Akk. term ikribu is often used as a generic term for prayer (see CAD I/J,
62, 65–66). Due to its distinctive employment in the rubrics of divinatory ritual
texts, however, the term has also come to designate a specific kind of prayer of
the diviner. As Ivan Starr describes it,

[t]he term ikribu must be understood within a ritual setting: it is bound
with the acts accompanying each step of the diviner’s ritual activities in the
course of performing an extispicy. The ikribu forms an integral part of such
a set of rituals. This suggests the following definition: an ikribu is a prayer
organically bound with each particular step in the ritual activities of the di-
viner, and recited by him in the course of performing an extispicy. 176
Note, however, that the term is not always employed in a consistent manner by
Assyriologists. It has been extended by some scholars to other prayers of the
diviner that contain content similar to the ikribu-prayers yet do not bear the
ikribu-rubric (see page 85). 177
As Starr’s comments have already shown, the ikribu-prayers are embedded
in a broader ritual text/performance—indicated sometimes explicitly by the sur-
rounding ritual instructions on the tablet or only implicitly by the content of the
prayer itself or the sequence in which several prayers are ordered. Throughout
the course of the ikribu-ritual the diviner prepares and performs in a series of
steps the ritual slaughter of the animal used for divination (i.e., extispicy). For
each step of the ritual process an ikribu-text may contain ritual instructions
about the diviner’s actions and/or an indication of the appropriate ritual word-
ing (prayer) that accompanies the actions. When the text of a prayer is given on
the tablet, the purpose of the prayer is identified with a rubric, ikrib X, in which
X stands for the ritual action of a particular step in the larger ritual process. For
example, Zimmern, BBR, no. 95, a fragmentary tablet, preserves five rubrics (see
lines 2, 12, 20, 25, and 31) to five different ikribu-prayers preserved (partially)
on the tablet. 178 There are no ritual instructions surrounding the prayers, but the
five rubrics clearly outline various ritual steps in the process of an extispicy:
2. [ikrib] ina surti [bīni nadê], “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the setting
down of a circle of tamarisk wood.”
12. [ikrib kalli upunta 179 mullî-ma] kunni, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the
filling and setting out of a bowl of flour.”
176
Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 45. Ikrib is W. G. Lambert’s preferred designation, as mentioned in
an oral communication to the Würzburg Rencontre Assryiologique Internationale in 2008 (per-
sonal communication, Christopher Frechette) and utilized in his work on the tamitu-prayers (see,
e.g., Babylonian Oracle Questions, 12). He argues that because the construct form is always used
in the rubric, that form of the word should be the name of this class of the diviners’ prayers.
177
See, e.g., Mayer, UFBG, 32, n.63, who lists some (OB) texts that do not have the rubric to-
gether with ones that do bear it. (The list is now out-dated.) See also L. de Meyer, “Deux prières
ikribu du Temps d’Assmī-ṣaduqa,” in Zikir Šumim: Assyriological Studies Presented to F. R. Kraus on
the Occasion of his Seventieth Birthday (ed. G. van Driel, Th. J. H. Krispijn, M. Stol, and K. R.
Veenhof; Leiden: Brill, 1982), 271–78, who uses the label ikribu for two OB prayers that do not
actually bear the rubric. (See likewise the mention of a third prayer at 271, n.7.)
178
Line 32 seems to begin a sixth prayer.
179
Zimmern, BBR, 210 reads upuntu (also written upumtu) here while CAD (e.g., K, 83) reads
maḫaṣtu. Both words denote some kind of flour.4820. [ikrib erēni ina upun]ti zuqqupi (or sukkupi), “an ikribu-prayer that accompa-
nies the setting up(?) 180 of cedar in flour.”
25. [ikrib nignakka] pēnta mullî-ma kunni, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the
filling of a censor with charcoal and setting (it) out.”
31. [ikrib p]uḫādi ḫuppi, “an ikribu-prayer that accompanies the purifying of the
lamb.”
The fact that these prayers are to be recited sequentially within a broader ritual
is demonstrated by another ikribu-text that preserves ritual instructions prescrib-
ing a series of recitations of ikribu-prayers and their associated ritual actions, all
of which precisely match the sequence above (see BBR, nos. 75–78: 22–29). 181
Ikribu-prayers typically begin with the invocation of Shamash and Adad, the
gods of extispicy, though other deities could be invoked, too (e.g., Ninurta as the
star Sirius, 182 Ishtar of Nineveh, and Sin). The wording of the invocation of Sha-
mash and Adad is almost always the same: Šamaš bēl dīnim u Adad bēl bīri, “O
Shamash, lord of judgment, Adad, lord of divination.” 183 The middle section of
the prayers contains statements and petitions appropriate to whatever ritual
actions are being prescribed. The most important theme in this section is ac-
ceptance of the diviner’s ritual actions. The prayers do not end with praise as
many of the prayers discussed so far. Rather, they tend to conclude with very
formulaic petitionary phrases that lay emphasis on the central concern of the
ritual as a whole. For example, YOS 11 23, a long OB text preserving a number
of ikribu-prayers, preserves the following concluding formula in several brief
prayers near the tablet’s end: ina imitti puḫādim annîm kittam u šumēl puḫādim
annîm kittam šuknān, “in the right of this lamb (place) truth, and the left of this
lamb place truth” (see lines 137, 140, 142). Similarly, the first millennium ikri-
bu-prayers conclude—when a conclusion is preserved—with the following for-
mula: Šamaš u Adad izizzānim-ma ina qibītīya nīš qātīya ina mimma mala eppušu
tamīt akarrabu kitta libši, “O Shamash and Adad, stand here that in my speaking,
the lifting of my hands, whatever I do, the query that I pray there may be truth!”
This final petition for the gods to place truth (kittu), an idea that arises quite

The meaning of zuqqupu or sukkupu is uncertain (see CAD Z, 54).
The same five prayers, referenced by rubric only (the text is not given), appear in the same
order in Zimmern, BBR, no. 96: 6–10.

Eingeweideschauers an Ninurta,” Or n.s. 74 (2005), 51–56 (reference courtesy of Christopher

183
There are exceptions to this invocation, however. See, e.g., YOS 11 23:1 (= HSM 7494),
edited by Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 25–106, specifically 30, and AO 7032: 1, given in copy by
Jean Nougayrol, “Textes hépatoscopiques d’époque ancienne conserves au Musée du Louvre,” RA
38 (1941), 67–88, specifically 87, transliterated by Starr, Rituals of the Diviner, 122. Both of these
read: Šamaš bēl dīnim u Adad bēl ikribī u bīri, “O Shamash, lord of judgment, Adad, lord of ex-
tispicy-rituals and divination.” See the same additional epithet throughout the ikribu-related OB
prayer of the diviner, beginning on page 85.

49
frequently in the ikribu-prayers and others associated with them, 184 is the central
purpose of both the ikribu-prayer as well as the entire ritual of extispicy. By
asking the deities to “place truth” the diviner intends to make an “appeal for the
manifestation of the oracular verdict,” 185 an accurate and trustworthy indication
of the will of the gods in the exta of the animal.
Unfortunately, the current state of publication of the ikribu-prayers does not
allow us to discuss issues of standardization or the arrangement of the prayers in
a series. It is hoped that W. G. Lambert’s promised edition will shed light on
such issues.

Although there is still some question about the precise meaning of the term,
Akk. tamītu is understood by Lambert to mean “oracle question.” 186 Despite this
name, there is no reason to exclude the tamitu-texts from the category of prayer
as it is defined in this introduction. 187 These texts invoke a god and express con-
cerns to that god (albeit in the form of a question) in order to gain divine assis-
tance (in the form of a yes-no response via an extispicy result). All of the texts
treated in Lambert’s edition are written in SB Akkadian and were found in first
millennium contexts, even if it is likely that some of them go back to OB
times. 188
The tamitu-prayers address Shamash and Adad as a pair, using the same ep-
ithets in their initial lines as do the ikribu-prayers: “lord of judgment” (bēl dīnim)
and “lord of divination” (bēl bīri), respectively. Like the ikribu-prayers, 189 the

The phrase also occurs in the OB prayers related to the diviner treated in this volume. See the
prayer at page 85 (its lines 13, 18, 33, 41, 49, 53, 57, 66) and the one at page 78 (line 24).

See Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5–7 for Lambert’s etymological discussion. He claims that
the two very similar words tāmītu (OB tāwītum) and tamītu were “confused or equated” in ancient
times (6). Starr translates the term similarly, “oracle query” (Queries to the Sungod, 357). CDA,
402, following AHw, 1340 (s.v. tāwītum), renders the former “response” (“Anfragebeantwor-
tung”) and the latter “oath” (“Beschworenes, Eid”) (CDA, 397 and AHw, 1314).
187
On the basis of his remarks in the introduction, it is likely that Lambert would agree (see
Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5). On the other hand, von Soden does not include tamitus in his
overview of Akkadian prayers (see his “Gebete II,” 165).
188
See Babylonian Oracle Questions, 7 and Starr, Queries to the Sungod, xxix.
189
In fact, some tamitu-prayer colophons preserve the phrase tamīt ikribi, rendered by Lambert
as “petitionary tamītus” (Babylonian Oracle Questions, 5), which shows the close relationship of
the two kinds of texts. For the ikribus and other texts related to tamitus, see ibid., 12–14.50tamitu-prayers petition the gods of extispicy for a judgment. The distinctive
characteristic of the petitions in the tamitus is that they communicate the actual
query the supplicant wishes the gods to answer. The queries are always couched
in question form; in fact, the texts are dominated typically by a (sometimes long)
string of questions that often cover the issue of concern from various perspec-
tives, “so that,” as Lambert writes, “the answer would not mislead due to defects
in the phraseology of the question.” 190 These questions are always asked in a
fashion that can be answered via an affirmative or negative reply. Sometimes the
questions concern things beyond the control of the supplicant (e.g., a lunar
eclipse or whether a pregnant woman will survive delivery), but more often than
not the questions concern a course of action to which the supplicant wants the
gods to give the stamp of approval (e.g., a military action). Because the diviners
were aware of the possibility that even the longest list of questions could leave
potential loopholes that might lead to an unclear reply, the diviners added what
is called ezib-clauses (ezib is an imperative meaning “leave aside, ignore”) that
asked the gods to overlook or dismiss anything that might impede a reliable
answer. The answer, that is, the decision of the gods, is provided via extispicy,
though there is one text in which an exceptional means of divination occurs (see
Lambert’s text no. 15). The answers are not recorded with the tamitus. We do,
however, have tablets on which diviners report the results of their extispicy ritu-
als for delivery to the person concerned, oftentimes the king. 191
The queries as they have come down to us were not asked for a particular
occasion; or rather, if they were, the particulars were not usually preserved
(there are a few exceptions). Several lines of evidence taken together suggest
this conclusion. First, some of the textual witnesses for tamitus preserve more
than one query-prayer per physical tablet, indicating an attempt to create a
compendium or series. Although there is no single standardized series of tami-
tus, Lambert presents evidence for several local serial collections from Nimrud,
Nineveh, and some other Babylonian city (possibly Sippar or Babylon). 192 Sec-
ond, some of the texts occur in multiple copies. If these were one-off texts creat-
ed for a particular situation, one would not expect to find multiple copies. Third,
annanna and annannītu occur as substitutes for proper names within the texts
with only a few exceptions (all of the exceptions are names that go back to the

OB period). 193 These generic placeholder words strongly suggest the texts were
intended to be adapted for a variety of clients. It seems therefore that the tami-
tu-prayers were part of the scribal tradition and were preserved as models, at
least potentially, for similar situations that might arise in the future. Lambert
finds this idea “certain because different surviving questions on related subjects
are in part identically worded.” 194
The tablets preserving the tamitus in Lambert’s edition typically include the
rubric tamīt X at the end of each query, where X represents a thematic distilla-
tion of the text’s query. For example, Lambert’s text no. 1, line 183 reads tamīt
ana šulum maṣṣarti, “a query for the safety of the guards (lit. watch)” (see page
470). His text no. 21, line 9 reads tamīt annannītu itti annanna mutīša kīnāti ītam-
mi, “a query concerning whether female so-and-so is speaking the truth (lit. true
things) to male so-and-so, her husband.” The tamitu-prayers range over a broad
array of topics including such things as lunar eclipses, the result of a river or-
deal, and whether a slave had been faithful to his master, but the success of mili-
tary actions and personal safety are the topics most frequently found.
The following is a description of the structure of a typical tamitu-prayer,
based on Lambert’s work. 195 After the invariable invocation (cited above), tami-
tu-prayers may include an identification of the person for whom the diviner is
performing the extispicy and the stipulated term, that is, the time period for
which the inquiry applies (usually within the month or the year the ritual is
being performed). The question that the supplicant wishes the gods to answer
may be presented at any point after the invocation. The persuasions take the
form of flattery, ilūtkunu rabītu īde, “your great divinity knows,” or what Lambert
interprets (cautiously) as an implied threat, āmiru immaru šēmû išemmû, “the seer
will see (and) the hearer will hear.” The latter is interpreted by Lambert as fol-
lows: “if no answer, or a wrong answer is given, news of this may spread to the
detriment of the gods’ reputation.” 196 The first form of persuasion may occur
anywhere after the invocation; the second form always comes after the diviner’s
question. Technical qualifications, that is, the clauses intended to cover possible
oversights or problems with the formulation of the question, if present, occur
after the question itself. These qualifications are usually expressed with the ezib-
clauses but a “why”-question format, whose meaning is still unclear, is also at-
tested. The tamitu-prayers end in a variety of ways, but the most common is the
rather abrupt (ilūtkunu) Šamaš u Adad kīam, “Your divinity, O Shamash and
Adad, thus.” It is likely that the kīam indicates an abbreviation and should be
taken to mean “etc.,” suggesting that the diviner would fill in the ending for

The OB names are all kings, Hammurabi, Abi-Eshuḫ, and Samsu-ditana, and they are only
mentioned in the Nimrud edition (see Lambert, Babylonian Oracle Questions, 15).

See ibid., 17 for a brief discussion of both stock phrases and contrast it with Starr’s interpre-
tation (Queries to the Sun God, xix–xx). See note 200 below.52themselves with some formulaic phrase(s). Sometimes kīam is followed by a de-
scription of the ritual acts involved in the extispicy. 197
The tamitu-prayers are very similar to the NA queries to Shamash, written
during the Sargonid-era (722–609 BCE ) in SB Akkadian and edited by Ivan Starr
in Queries to the Sun God (SAA 4). Unlike the tamitus in Lambert’s edition, these
prayer-queries are coarsely written one to a tablet without duplicates and seem
therefore to be intended for one and only one occasion. Also unlike the tamitus,
they are only addressed to Shamash; Adad is entirely absent. There are many
structural similarities between the two kinds of queries and they share many
phrases, but on the whole the NA queries are more rigid and formulaic.
These prayers invariably open with the phrase, Šamaš bēlu rabû ša ašallūka
anna kīna apalanni, “O Shamash, great lord, whom I am asking, answer me with
a firm yes.” 198 The stipulated term is designated and then follows the query
proper, formulated as a direct question, as in the tamitu-prayers. Unlike the
question in the tamitu-prayers, however, the query in the NA texts have a highly
formulaic structure and utilize stereotyped phrases throughout, some of which
are keyed to particular topics that arise in the queries somewhat frequently. 199
The first and last of three closing formulae in the query correspond to what
Lambert calls persuasions (see above). The middle closing formula in the query
reads, ina šalimti ina pî ilūtīka rabīti Šamaš bēlu rabû qabi kūn, “with a favorable
reply, according to the command of your great divinity, O Shamash, great lord,
speak (and) confirm (it).” 200
The ezib-clauses follow the query. Unlike the tamitu-prayers, these clauses
are quite extensive in the NA texts and may be divided into three sections. The
first section of ezibs derives from the particular situation of the query and there-
fore contains clauses of quite variable content. The second section contains ezibs
that are attested between three and eight times and seem to be somewhat stereo-
typed (e.g., “disregard that an angry man, or one in distress spoke angrily the
words of his report” 201 ). They are much less common than those found in the
third section, the standard ezibs. These seven clauses are concerned with the
ritual performance itself and the purity of everything involved in the extispicy
(the diviner, the lamb, and the location of the ritual). These ezibs are always
found in the queries, appear in the same order, and, apart from the last two,
show little variation in their construction and wording. 202

The following general outline of the NA query to Shamash is based on Starr’s work in Queries
to the Sun God, xvi–xxviii.

See ibid., xviii.
200
Starr translates all three closing formulae as questions (ibid., xx). The above translation fol-
lows Lambert’s notion that the phrases that conclude the query are intended to persuade the
deity to give a positive reply. Therefore, they are translated as statements.

See ibid., xxi.
202
See ibid., xxii–xxvii for details.

53
A standardized formula bridges between the ezibs and the repetition of the
query: lū nasḫā lū bērā, “though they (i.e., these formulations) be excerpted,
though they be selected.” 203 According to Lambert, this formula, which may also
conclude a tamitu-prayer, was one last attempt by the diviner to cover all poten-
tial problems in his prayer that might lead to misleading results. 204 The repeated
query, unlike the first occurrence, is stated as an indirect question, ašâlka Šamaš
bēlu rabû kî, “I ask you, O Shamash, great lord, whether. . . .”
Two closing formulae end the prayer. The first one has a longer and shorter
form: 205 ina libbi immeri annî izizzam-ma anna kīna {uṣurāti šalmāti šērē tamīt
damqāti šalmāti ša pî ilūtīka rabīti} šuknam-ma lūmur, which, following Starr, may
be translated as “be present (lit. stand) in this sheep, place an affirmative answer
(in it), {favorable designs, favorable, propitious omens of the oracular query by
the command of your great divinity} so that I may see (them).” The second clos-
ing formula reads: eli ilūtīka rabīti Šamaš bēlu rabû lillik-ma têrtu lītappal, “[m]ay
(this) query go to your great divinity, O Shamash, great lord, and may an oracle
be given as an answer” (again, following Starr). 206 These two closing formulae
were often written with a gap between them on the tablet, into which the divin-
er recorded the technical results of the extispicy.

As a preface to the discussion, some important distinctions should be noted
within the Akkadian material grouped by modern Assyriologists under the head-
ing “letter-prayers.” 209 Akkadian letter-prayers in the OB period were written by
private individuals and kings. Individuals presented personal petitions to a deity,
probably a personal deity. 210 Kings expressed concerns that may be characterized
as political and/or military in nature to a deity—issues more appropriate to a
king. 211 The literary form of all of these OB letter-prayers is quite comparable to
a mundane or secular letter. And there is no indication that the senders viewed
them as anything beyond just that (though see below). (The identification of
these texts as prayer, therefore, derives not from an ancient scribal classification
but from the modern definition of prayer that scholars have imposed on the
texts.) In distinction to the OB letter-prayers, the Akkadian letter-prayers in the
first millennium all derive from the Assyrian imperial court and were composed
by/for Assyrian kings to report their military actions to the gods. These texts
display a very polished literary style and include various feats of heroism and
military prowess in order to aggrandize the king. 212 Although they begin as do
letters, these texts show more similarities with the Assyrian royal inscriptions
than mundane letters. Without intending to prejudice the discussion or to dis-
qualify or limit the term’s use to only a segment of this material, the ensuing
discussion is based on the OB letter-prayers from individuals.
The OB letter-prayers often contain many of the same features as other clas-
ses of prayer discussed in this introduction: an invocation, perhaps a brief divine
epithet, laments, petitions, and a promise of praise. Three elements, however,
make the letter-prayers distinct from the other prayer classes discussed in this
209

gesprochen hast, . . .“,” 3–23. The work of William W. Hallo, a long-time student of Sumerian
letter-prayers, is now available in his collected essays volume The World’s Oldest Literature: Stud-
ies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres, 255–367.

Van der Toorn (Family Religion, 131) believes all of the private letter-prayers are addressed to
a deity in the capacity of a personal god. There are only about a half dozen or so OB letter-
prayers from individuals (see van der Toorn, Family Religion, 130, n.64). Those known to me
include the prayers listed in note 207 above along with F. R. Kraus, “Ein altbabylonischer
Privatbrief an eine Gottheit,” RA 65 (1971), 27–36.
211
All of the OB royal letter-prayers are from Mari. See ARM 26=AEM I/1, nos. 191 and 193
and ARM 1 3. On the latter, see Jack M. Sasson, “Yasmah-Addu’s Letter to God (ARM I : 3),”

See, e.g., Riekele Borger, Die Inschriften Asarhaddons Königs von Assyrien (AfO Beiheft 9; Osna-
brück: Biblio-Verlag, 1967 [1956]), 102–7 (§68) for Esarhaddon’s letter to the gods. An English
translation is available in Daniel D. Luckenbill, Ancient Records of Assyria and Babylonia, 2 vols.

introduction. First, the letter-prayers use the epistolary format to express the
supplicant’s concerns to the deity. The letter-prayers therefore begin as would
any standard letter, ana DN qibī-ma umma PN-ma, “To DN, thus says PN.” Sec-
ond, the letter-prayers were written for a particular situation. Therefore, one will
not find in these prayers the generic annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-
and-so,” formula often found in the other prayers because the OB letter-prayers
were not intended to be used over and over again. Finally, the OB letter-prayers
seem to have been used as ex voto objects. 213 That is, like a statue placed before
a deity on one’s behalf (see footnote 27 above), an OB letter-prayer was deposit-
ed before the deity’s image in the shrine. If the evidence of AbB 6, no. 135 may
be generalized, it seems a letter-prayer was read to the deity (by someone other
than the supplicant) before being deposited. 214 The tablet would then become a
physical reminder before the deity of the supplicant’s concerns and petitions.
Royal Prayers:
Essential Bibliography: Benjamin R. Foster. Akkadian Literature of the Late Period. Guides
to the Mesopotamian Textual Record 2. Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, 2007, 82–87. {A list
of several royal prayers and hymns.}
In many respects “royal prayers” is a non-category since nearly all of the
prayers in this volume were or could have been used by kings of ancient Meso-
potamia. The prayers that modern scholars typically place in this category,
therefore, are miscellaneous and occasional prayers that were composed explicit-
ly for royal purposes but do not fit easily elsewhere in the taxonomy of prayers
used by Assyriologists. Rather than list these in extenso, only the largest, most
coherent group of texts is discussed here: the various prayers found in building
inscriptions. The NB kings almost always ended their building inscriptions with
a prayer (also referred to as a blessing, Segenswunsch). 215 The deity addressed in
the prayer was determined by what was most appropriate for the structure being
commemorated in the inscription. 216 For example, the concluding prayer to an
inscription commemorating Nebuchadnezzar’s restoration of the Ebabbar temple
at Larsa was directed to Shamash, the resident deity of the temple. 217 Examples

ers a translation of what he identifies as “the last datable Akkadian prayer” (866; see also Seux,
525–26 and von Soden, 291). The prayer, directed at Nabu, occurs in a building inscription from
the reign of the Seleucid king Antiochus Soter (281–261 BCE ).

although the Assyrian kings occasionally had prayers literally inscribed on the
various parts of their royal structures. The particular god addressed by such a
prayer, as was the case in the NB prayers, was determined by the object being
inscribed. The parade example comes from Dur Shurrukin, where Sargon had a
short prayer inscribed on the thresholds (or stairs) leading to the temples of Sin,
Adad, Ninurta, Ea, Ningal, and Nabu. 219 In each case, the deity of the temple is
invoked and then petitioned to grant something to the king such as life, a long
reign, good weather, etc. Conspicuously and similar to the NB prayers, these
prayers do not end in praise.

Akkadian hymnic material, that is, passages in texts that contain praise to a
benevolent supra-human entity, exists in a variety of genres in Akkadian: myths
(e.g., Enūma eliš VI 121–VII 162 220 ), literary texts (e.g., Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 1–40,
see page 483), prayers (as already mentioned above), and royal inscriptions

also available in the more recent work of Andreas Fuchs, Die Inschriften Sargons II. aus Khorsabad
(Göttingen: Cuvillier, 1994), 280–83 (texts) and 369–71 (translations). There seems to have been
a prayer to Shamash also, but it is very poorly preserved (Fuchs, Inschriften, 281). See Foster,
784–87, Seux, 527–30, and von Soden, 279–81 for translations.
220
Von Soden considers this material hymnic, even if not a hymn strictly speaking (see his
“Hymne. B. Nach akkadischen Quellen,” 547). The text is available in Philippe Talon, The Stand-
ard Babylonian Creation Myth: Enūma Eliš (SAACT 4; Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus

cations in annalistic texts 221 ). Independent hymnic compositions that praise a
benevolent supra-human being (e.g., a god, but also a king, temple, or even
city 222 ) comprise a relatively small group in the preserved Akkadian textual cor-
pus. The number of complete or very well-preserved examples is even smaller.
Unfortunately, despite superscripts and subscripts on some hymnic texts as well
as the availability of ancient catalogs that organize various lyrical compositions
under specific labels, modern scholars have not been able to match formal fea-
tures of the hymns with indigenous scribal classificatory labels. 223 Introductory
treatments of hymns, therefore, tend to be compilations of attested texts, orga-
nized by time period, content (e.g., by entity praised or by the human doing the
praise), and/or various formal characteristics in the hymns that have caught the
eye of the modern scholar. 224
A complete taxonomy of the extant hymns with an exhaustive listing is not
possible here. 225 Rather, the present section provides a selection of notable, rep-
resentative, and relatively well-preserved examples of hymns 226 that are availa-
ble in modern editions and translations. Readers desiring to study more hymns
beyond the couple in this volume might turn to these examples next.
221
For dedicatory texts, see, e.g., two dedications to Adad and Ninurta in A. Kirk Grayson, Assyr-
ian Rulers of the Early First Millennium BC : II (858–745 BC ) (RIMA 3; Toronto: University of Toron-
to Press, 1996), 59 and 182, respectively. Many others could be cited. See also the hymnic invo-
cations used in, e.g., several versions of the annals of Shalmaneser (Grayson, Assyrian Rulers of
the Early First Millennium, 13, 26, 33, 51, etc.).
222
For a listing of hymns to the latter three groups, see Foster, Akkadian Literature of the Late
Period, 44–47. For the problems and artificiality of differentiating between these, see briefly
Edzard, “Sumerische und akkadische Hymnen,” 22.
223
The fragmentary state of many hymns has not helped matters. For a discussion of hymns,
scribal superscripts/subscripts, and catalogs, see Brigitte Groneberg, “Searching for Akkadian
Lyrics: From Old Babylonian to the ‘Liederkatalog’ KAR 158,” JCS 55 (2003), 55–74. Classifica-
tory scribal labels, as Groneberg shows, do not seem to correspond to textual form. Rather, they
may have reflected the text’s musical accompaniment, mode of performance, language, ritual
function, and/or content.
224
See, e.g., von Soden, “Hymne. B. Nach akkadischen Quellen,” 545–48 and Foster, Akkadian
Literature of the Late Period, 78–91.
225
For OB hymns, however, the catalog of literary texts in Nathan Wasserman, Style and Form in
Old-Babylonian Literary Texts (Cuneiform Monographs 27; Leiden/Boston: Styx/Brill, 2003), 187–
224 presents a convenient list of all of the (then) known hymns (many of which are fragmen-
tary). Add the hymn to Ningishzida in A. R. George, Babylonian Literary Texts in the Schøyen
Collection (Cornell University Studies in Assyriology and Sumerology 10; Bethesda: CDL Press,
2009), no. 7 and see also M. Krebernik, “Altbabylonische Hymnen an die Muttergöttin (HS
1884),” AfO 50 (2003–2004), 11–20. The anthologies of Akkadian hymns and prayers (see espe-
cially Foster, Seux, and von Soden) give a large and representative sample of hymns, but they do
not reflect an exhaustive catalog. Also, Foster, Akkadian Literature of the Late Period, 78–91 pro-
vides an annotated listing of many first millennium examples.
226
Though, the OB examples are not so well-preserved.58Among OB Texts:
A hymn to Nanaya (VAS 10 215) is composed in fourteen quatrains, as is
the hymn to Ishtar in this volume (see page 111). The Nanaya hymn is relatively
well-preserved, though still incomplete. 227
A hymn to Ishtar from the Louvre (AO 6035) was edited by Brigitte Grone-
berg for the first time relatively recently. Although the tablet is not complete
and an English translation is not available (to my knowledge), Groneberg’s edi-
tion is accompanied by an extensive commentary. 228
Another OB hymn that has regularly found its way into anthologies praises
the obscure god Papulegarra. 229 The tablet probably contains several hymns, but
breaks make precise demarcations between the hymns impossible. 230
Among SB Texts:
Although there are several examples that could be listed, two lengthy and
well-preserved hymns ought to be mentioned first: the Great Shamash Hymn and
the Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi.
The Great Shamash Hymn, edited by W. G. Lambert in his book Babylonian
Wisdom Literature, 231 is a two-hundred-line hymn that celebrates a wide array of
the sun-god’s attributes. 232 The hymn begins with Shamash’s role as the universal
illuminator of darkness, whose light reaches the innermost parts of everything,
and then continues on to mention various justice-related attributes of the deity:
investigation of cases, protection of travelers and other innocents, enforcement

mentary (with plates I–XXVI). The Agushaya Poem, also called Ishtar and Ṣaltu (ṣaltu means
“strife” in Akk.), recounts a chapter in Ishtar’s mythology, but it contains a significant hymnic
element. See Groneberg, Lob der Ištar, 55–93 for an edition, translation, and commentary. See

232
The content of the hymn (“practical advice on living”) led Lambert to include it among his
collection of “wisdom” texts (Babylonian Wisdom Literature, 5). See page 6 above for the potential
hortatory purpose of prayers and hymns among human listeners.I NTRODUCTION

of oaths, impartial judgment of cases, ensuring of fair business transactions,
helping those in need, granting wisdom to those who ask, etc.
The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi, also edited by Lambert, 233 is another two-
hundred-line hymn, which divides into twenty stanzas of varied length. After an
introductory line that mentions the goddess in the third person, Gula speaks in
the first person until line 188, at which point Bulluṭsa-rabi, the putative author
of the text, begins his concluding petition (in the third person). In the nineteen
stanzas before Bulluṭsa-rabi’s petition Gula alternates her speech between a stan-
za of self-praise (the topic of which varies from stanza to stanza) followed by a
stanza of praise for her spouse, Ninurta (the topic of which is always martial).
Each of these nineteen stanzas ends with the giving of a different name to the
goddess or god. 234
These two texts fall into a category called “Great Hymns and Prayers” by
Foster. 235 In this group, he lists seven hymns/prayers, distinguished mostly by
their extraordinary length (well over one hundred lines). Other examples of the
great hymns and prayers include the Great Prayer to Marduk, 236 the Great Hymn
to Marduk, 237 the Great Hymn to Nabu, 238 Ishtar Queen of Heaven, 239 and the
Great Prayer to Ishtar (for which, see page 257). 240 Given the sophistication of

Why Foster excludes from his list here the long prayer to Ishtar, edited by Lambert in “Three
Literary Prayers of the Babylonians,” 50–55 (with plates VIII–XI), is unclear since he includes it
in Before the Muses, 606–10 (see also Seux, 194–99).60these texts in terms of language, style, and content, they are probably the work
of ancient scholars.
Ashurbanipal’s hymn to Ashur (ABRT I 32–34) provides a good, if still in-
complete example of a hymn in SB Akkadian from the Neo-Assyrian court. 241 In
this hymn, written for the sake of Ashurbanipal (see rev. 8ʹ), Ashur’s name is
written as if it were Anshar ( AN . ŠÁR ), the father of Anu and the great-grandfather
of Marduk according to the Enūma eliš, thus equating Ashur with a god older
than Marduk and exalting Ashur to the head of the pantheon (see rev. 6ʹ).
The so-called syncretistic hymns laud a deity while equating various other
gods with aspects of the deity being praised. Several (incomplete) examples are
known, including a hymn containing a petition to Marduk (KAR 25 ii 3–24), 242
and hymns to Nabu (LKA 16), 243 Ninurta (KAR 102+328), 244 and Ishtar (BM
65454+). 245
Finally, some of the hymns preserved in Akkadian display acrostics, in
which the first syllable of each line combines to spell out a name, petition, or
statement of praise. A notable example is found in Ashurbanipal’s hymn to Mar-
duk (ABRT I 29–31+). 246 The syllables at the beginning of each line combine to
spell out anāku Aššur-bāni-apli ša ilsûka bulliṭannī-ma Maruduk (ma-ru-du-uk) da-
lilīka ludlul, “I (am) Ashurbanipal, who has called out to you, O Marduk. Pre-
serve me that I may sing your praises!” 247

T HE U SE OF A KKADIAN P RAYERS IN THE S TUDY OF THE H EBREW B IBLE :
Anna Elise Zernecke
Scholars of the Hebrew Bible have compared Akkadian prayers and hymns
to the biblical text since the late nineteenth century, when publications and
translations of the Akkadian texts first appeared. Unfortunately, the interest in
these texts was much greater at the beginning of the twentieth century than it is
today. The following pages outline the use of Akkadian prayers in the history of
biblical scholarship, assess the strengths and weaknesses of the various ap-
proaches employed, and conclude by offering some prospects for future compar-
ative work. 248
The first editions and translations of prayers of the lifting of the hand were
published in 1896 by King. The title of King’s book, Babylonian Magic and Sor-
cery. Being ‘The Prayers of the Lifting of the Hand’, already indicates that he was
not sure whether the texts were to be classified as religious or magical. 249 This
insecurity is also clear in the introduction where he characterizes these texts as
“a complete group of tablets inscribed with prayers and religious compositions
of a devotional and somewhat magical character.” 250 The qualification of their
character as magical or religious has also influenced the interest of biblical
scholars in these texts, so that decisions in favor of one of these categories or the
other often gave direction to the Akkadian texts’ reception and interpretation.
The transmission of the texts as part of a ritual was deemed very important in
this regard, though the ritual instructions were often not included in Assyriolog-
ical editions.
Shortly after the first editions appeared, anthologies of translated texts aim-
ing at a wider public made the Akkadian prayers more easily accessible. 251 Bibli-
cal scholars at this time began using the Akkadian prayers as parallels to biblical
prayers, especially the Psalms. The “religionsgeschichtliche Schule” had just
started to establish itself. Therefore, it is not surprising that the first monograph
that compares biblical Psalms with Akkadian prayers, the Habilitation of Stum-
mer, written in Würzburg in 1917, used its form-critical methodology. 252 Along
with his innovative method, Stummer also pursued another question that has
often been asked since the Akkadian prayers were discovered: Is there a genetic

24962relationship between the Akkadian and Hebrew prayers? Stummer answers this
by stating that the authors of the Psalms in fact knew Mesopotamian prayers.
Due to the Akkadian material’s state of publication at the time of his writing,
Stummer mixes texts of many genres and does not differentiate between Sumeri-
an and Akkadian material. But the more basic problem in his work is that the
comparison is done with a theological aim: he wants to establish the high reli-
gious level of Israel’s sacred poetry. 253 Following Gunkel’s form-critical method-
ology at that time, Stummer had taken Gunkel’s statement that there was no
more pressing task for Old Testament scholarship than the systematic compari-
son of the Babylonian and Hebrew religious poetry as an impetus for his work. 254
In response to Stummer’s work, however, Gunkel and Begrich wrote in their
Introduction to the Psalms (1933) 255 that the time had not yet come for a system-
atic comparison of both literatures, as neither of them had been independently
and thoroughly studied. 256
Nevertheless, it was Begrich, who analyzed one aspect of Biblical and Meso-
potamian prayers in a comparative perspective in an article entitled “Die Ver-
trauensäußerungen im israelitischen Klageliede des Einzelnen und in seinem
babylonischen Gegenstück” (1928). 257 Begrich’s approach is much more cautious
than Stummer’s. He first establishes the comparability of biblical and Mesopo-
tamian prayers, discussing the superscriptions and subscriptions, the person of
the supplicant, and their situation. After this, he analyzes the main differences
between the psalms of individual lament and prayers of the lifting of the hand.
Instead of a personal confession of trust as in the biblical texts, the Babylonian
prayers show descriptions of the magnificence of the deity. For Begrich, the un-
derlying relationship between god and man is different in both cultures: where
there is trusting confidence in the biblical material because of a personal rela-
tion, in Mesopotamia, the distance between the supplicant and the deity is such
that the striving for a relationship based on trust is squelched by the conscious-
ness of the grandeur of the deity. 258 Many more Mesopotamian texts are pub-
lished today and the editions are much more detailed, making Begrich’s results

out-of-date. Still, his cautious and precise methodology retains its value for con-
temporary scholarship.
Shortly after its publication, Begrich’s conclusions were contested in one of
the first Assyriological monographs dealing with the literary form of Mesopota-
mian prayers, Kunstmann’s dissertation Die babylonische Gebetsbeschwörung
(1932). 259 It was presumably this publication that coined the term “Gebets-
beschwörung” (incantation-prayer), following Kunstmann’s teacher Lands-
berger. Kunstmann’s methodology is form-critical. He distinguishes “allgemeine”
(general) and “spezielle” (special) “Gebetsbeschwörungen” (incantation-
prayers). In the special variety, the magical act is dominant. In the general in-
cantation-prayers, on the other hand, the prayer is the main and sometimes only
thing. 260 This distinction has not stood the test of time (see above, page 28).
In the years following, several biblical scholars used prayers from Mesopo-
tamia as parallels for biblical texts. Widengren’s monograph The Accadian and
Hebrew Psalms of Lamentation as Religious Documents (1937) is an early exam-
ple. 261 Widengren is not interested in the literary development of the prayers,
but in the comparison of religions. He presupposes an opposition of cult religion
and religious literature and sees a direct dependence of the biblical prayers on
Akkadian religious literature. Widengren’s book consists of long lists of phrases
from both types of texts and their interpretation. Though focusing on “cult reli-
gion,” the precise cultic setting of the texts is oddly not taken into account.
Widengren’s monograph is now of little more than historical interest; his main
thesis has not been followed.
Another comparative approach, again more form-critical in orientation, is
taken by Castellino in his Le Lamentazioni individuali e gli inni in Babilonia e in
Israele. Raffrontati riguardo alla forma e al contenuto (1940). 262 Castellino’s study
compares individual laments and hymns from Mesopotamia and Israel. He first
establishes the general compatibility of the texts by describing each corpus sepa-
rately and then compares the results. Despite this cautious methodology, the
results of the study are hampered by Castellino’s notion of magic, which is never
made explicit. He states that all Babylonian individual prayers are essentially
magical incantations aiming at coercing the gods. Therefore, his study ends up
being a comparison of the “Hebrew” and the “Babylonian-Assyrian religions,” in
which Israel certainly comes out as superior.

do alla forma e al contenuto (Torino: Società editrice internazionale, 1940).641953), 263 a new form-critical assessment of the relation between Mesopotamian
and Biblical prayers took shape in Westermann’s study Das Loben Gottes in den
Psalmen (first published in 1954). 264 Following Stummer and Kunstmann, his
main focus is on the hymnic introduction. Noting that Mesopotamian prayers of
lament have a hymnic introduction that has no equivalent in psalms of lament,
Westermann argued that this indicates that there are two different genres in the
Bible (the individual lament and what Westermann calls the hymn of descriptive
praise) whereas there is only one in Mesopotamia. The hymnic passages are seen
as praise of the deity within the pantheon in Mesopotamia, whereas in Israel
Yahweh has a history with his people which is praised. In other words, Mesopo-
tamians praised the gods in their cosmic function and their general actions and
the Israelites praised their god for what he had done for them in history. One
problem with this approach is that Westermann only looks at the abstract struc-
tures without taking into account their concretion in the individual texts. Also,
he does not see that in the hymnic passages of Akkadian prayers, the character-
istics of the deity, which are vital for the problems of the supplicant, are often
praised, therefore establishing a relationship between god and supplicant.
The general problem of many form-critical approaches is that the peculiari-
ties of the individual texts are overlooked in overall comparisons of genres. Dal-
glish’s monograph avoids this at least on one side: one single text, Psalm 51, 265 is
analyzed with parallels in structure and content from all over the ancient Near
East. The aim is to establish the relationship between biblical and ancient Near
Eastern prayer literature. The particularistic analysis of only one side of the
comparison, however, makes the study somewhat lopsided. Dalglish explains the
similarities in the ancient Near Eastern and biblical texts partly as a common
Proto-Semitic heritage and partly as influence of these other texts on Hebrew
literature. 266 But still, in his opinion, the differences outweigh the similarities.
After these studies, the form-critical approach lost its appeal to many bibli-
cal scholars. A symptom of this can be seen in Muilenburg’s presidential address
at the annual meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in 1968. 267 Yet among

„Gebetsbeschwörungen“ (1976), 268 was only published after the majority of Bibli-
cists had lost interest. Mayer closely follows Kunstmann’s study and meticulous-
ly collects the phrases and their combinations in every part of the prayers he
analyzes. This book was cited and studied among biblical scholars, but it could
not trigger a new initiative for comparing Akkadian and Hebrew prayers, even
though many of the former drawbacks in such work would now have been much
easier to overcome. Still, the Akkadian prayers continued to be read and studied
by some biblical scholars.
Gerstenberger’s monograph, Der bittende Mensch: Bittritual und Klagelied des
Einzelnen im Alten Testament (1980), 269 investigates the Sitz im Leben of the indi-
vidual laments in the book of Psalms. He reconstructs this partly by using shuil-
la-prayers and namburbi-rituals as analogies and postulates on the basis of this
analogy the existence of ritual specialists in Israel. These reconstructions are
quite plausible, though rather optimistic, as there is very little biblical evidence
with which to work.
A new approach is taken by Albertz in his Persönliche Frömmigkeit und offizi-
elle Religion: Religionsinterner Pluralismus in Israel und Babylon (1978). 270 In this
work Albertz first established the plurality within the religion of ancient Israel.
He distinguishes between different social strata of religion and tries to recon-
struct elements of private piety, which must be differentiated from the official
religion. Within this socially-differentiated framework, he classifies the biblical
psalms of individual lament as deriving from the domain of pre-exilic private
piety, whereas the Mesopotamian incantation-prayers originated in another so-
cial stratum of religion because of their complicated ritual contexts and their
developed hymnic introductions. Albertz also discusses the concept of a “person-
al god” for both Mesopotamia and Israel, which was first analyzed by Vorlän-
der. 271
In the last third of the twentieth century, Akkadian prayers were used in
Hebrew Bible scholarship in a variety of approaches. For example, the enemies
in the Biblical laments were explained as sorcerers in analogy to Mesopotamian
ritual texts. 272 The several biblical laments of the individual that lament Yah-

prayers were also used and cited when studying different literary and conceptual

sertation by Lee, Gattungsvergleich der akkadischen Šu-ila-Gebete mit den biblischen

Despite the occasional attention, only in the last ten years has a renewed in-
terest in Akkadian prayers and their relevance for the study of the Hebrew Bible
taken place. Following the methodological initiative of an article by Abusch, 277
Zgoll not only edited all extant shuilla-prayers addressed to Ishtar and fragments
thereof, but also interpreted them as pieces of literature (2003). 278 She also ana-
lyzed the function of the ritual setting of these prayers in several articles. 279 The
ritual dimensions and the problems of genre are also the main topic of Fre-
chette’s dissertation, “The Name of the Ritual: Investigating Ancient Mesopota-
mian ‘Hand-lifting’ Rituals with Implications for the Study of Genre in the
Psalms” (2005). 280 He inquires into the meaning of the characteristic subscrip-
tion of shuilla-prayers and discloses the problems of previous form-critical stud-
ies, which treated the ancient subscription as modern designations of genres
without inquiring into their original significance. He demonstrates the flexibility
of shuilla-prayers, which were recited in different ritual contexts. Finally, his

interpretation of the “lifted-hand” as a central and reciprocal gesture converges
with Zgoll’s analysis of the ritual as audience.
A very different approach is taken by Achenbach in two related articles
(2004), which look into the Sitz im Leben of both Mesopotamian and Biblical
prayers of different genres and investigate their transmission, collection, and
new contextualization within different rituals. 281
Lenzi (2010) 282 and Zernecke (2009) 283 take up anew the form-critical ques-
tion of Begrich’s “classical” paper. Via a different approach, both simultaneously
arrived at the conclusion that Begrich is right in his analysis that the relation
between deity and supplicant is different in Akkadian shuilla-prayers and bibli-
cal prayers of individual lament. But this does not indicate that the trust in
Yahweh was generally greater in Israel than the trust in the deities in Mesopo-
tamia. Shuilla-prayers are not the appropriate analogy to biblical laments of the
individual in terms of the relation between god and man. The Mesopotamian
dingirshadibba-prayers are structured like the biblical psalms of lament without
hymnic introduction, but they also comprise addresses demonstrating a close
and trustful relationship. Therefore, both authors conclude that the psalms of
individual lament are addressed to Yahweh as the personal god of the suppli-
cant, just as dingirshadibba-prayers are addressed to the personal god. On the
other hand, shuilla-prayers speak to a high deity of the pantheon and mention
the personal god and goddess only in passing. Zernecke arrives at this conclusion
via a detailed study of particular texts, as the definition of genre is different in
Assyriology and in Hebrew Bible studies. By comparing individual texts, the
conclusions are necessarily limited in scope, but this enables her to analyze the
different versions of single texts and their possible development over time.
During the last one hundred years, Akkadian prayers have proven an inter-
esting and important parallel to the prayers transmitted within the canon of the
Bible. The importance of the Mesopotamian texts cannot be overemphasized.
Since there are very few comparable texts from the Levant in Ugaritic or Arama-
ic with which to compare the biblical prayers, the Akkadian prayers are the
closest analogy to the biblical prayers and deserve much more attention than
they have received up to now. Most Akkadian prayers are known from tablets of
the first millennium BCE , spanning nearly the whole millennium; therefore, they
can be considered more or less contemporary to biblical literature.

psalmen Ps 38 und Ps 22 im Vergleich (AOAT 387; Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, forthcoming).68As scholars who study the form of these texts are now paying more atten-
tion to their ritual setting and function as well as to the difference between the
ancient subscriptions and modern form-critical designations, the discussion of
form-critical parallels should start afresh. Also, the question of ritual settings
and the different contextualizations of Akkadian prayers could be more inten-
sively discussed by biblical scholars. Most theories in the realm of literary criti-
cism, that is, reconstructing earlier stages of Biblical texts, are hypothetical. In
this point, the Akkadian material could serve as an important parallel, as the
texts are often transmitted on more than one tablet and with substantial differ-
ences. The poetic form of both Akkadian and biblical prayers is often similar,
but comparative studies in this field are rare so far. The wealth of motives and
concepts, of formulas and stock-phrases in both literatures also awaits a system-
atic analysis.
All of these prospective approaches are dependent on the future develop-
ment of Assyriology. But the analysis of these texts holds out the promise of so-
lutions for several old problems in biblical studies and the development of a
better understanding of what prayer and ritual meant in the ancient Near East,
in Mesopotamia and Israel, and how these cultures conceived the relation be-
tween deity and humanity.O LD B ABYLONIAN

An OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night
J EFFREY L. C OOLEY
T HE G ODS OF THE N IGHT :
The gods invoked in this prayer are not particularly distinguished in the OB
period. Indeed, other than Girra and Erra, those listed are not well-attested as
the focus of veneration, nor are they featured as principles in contemporary lit-
erature. 1 Nevertheless, the Gods of the Night (ilū mušītim) do appear in several
prayers in the magical ritual Maqlû, where they are petitioned for protection
against disease, black magic, and ritual impurity. 2 A more elaborate prayer to
night gods also for the purpose of preparing for an extispicy is known from the
NA period as well (see Oppenheim), though there does not seem to be any ge-
netic relationship between it and the OB prayer treated here. Although there is
modest overlap, the gods listed in our prayer, Maqlû, and the NA prayer are not
the same. Thus, the epithet “Gods of the Night” is by no means a formal title
associated with a fixed set of divinities. Rather, it is simply a descriptive rubric
to refer to any divine grouping that is visible at night in astral form and which a
particular text wishes to address en masse.
The primary manifestations of most of the Gods of the Night appear to be
specific stars and constellations, some of which we are able to identify with rea-
sonable certainty (see the notes below). On the other hand, Girra and Erra are
gods associated with fire and plague respectively and are mostly featured out-
side of a celestial context in cult and literature. Girra is the god of fire and the
hero in a fragmentary OB myth. In that myth, Girra slays a monster named
Elamatum, which is then transformed into a constellation. 3 He is often equated
with the god Gibil (one of Marduk’s fifty names in Enūma eliš VII 115), though
the two deities were originally separate. Girra/Gibil plays a significant role in
the magical defense against witchcraft, being one of the prime deities appealed

A possible exception to this is mušḫuššu, which might be featured in the fragmentary Labbu
Myth (see the comments to line 18).

7172to in the series Maqlû. Erra (who is often associated with Nergal) is the dark
protagonist of the first-millennium epic Erra and Ishum, 4 in which, not coinci-
dentally, celestial divination plays a major role. 5 Girra and Erra are associated
with celestial features in addition to their primary mundane hypostases. While
we do not know with what astral feature Girra is associated, Erra is later identi-
fied as a particular star, the Fox ( MUL . KA 5 . A , Akk. šēlebum) in the Wagon constel-
lation ( MUL . MAR . GÍD . DA , Akk. ereqqum, see line 19 below), 6 or even the planet
Mars (via his identification with the Fox star, which is also equated with Mars). 7
T HE P RAYER :
The prayer makes petition to these celestial deities for their participation in
an extispicy ritual, during which a lamb was sacrificed and its exta were exam-
ined. It would have been recited by a diviner (bārû) in the evening that the sacri-
fice took place. Such mantic acts were conceived in terms of a trial, with the
inquirer as the defendant and the gods as the judges. Thus, the terminology used
in the prayer is, to a certain degree, legal in nature (e.g., lines 6 and 8: Šamaš
Sîn Adad Ištar . . . ul idinnū dīnam ul iparrasū awātim “Shamash, Sin, Adad and
Ishtar . . . do not render judgment, they do not decide a case,” and line 24, kit-
tam šuknān, “place truth!”).
Though the patron gods of extispicy were Shamash and Adad (see pages 197
and 85), many of the major gods who dwelled in the sky were responsible for
the legal decision to be made. 8 According to the prayer (lines 6–7), however,
they are no longer present for the diviner to appeal to. The celestial deities here
invoked are stars and constellations which, like the sun during the day, have a
universal purview of the cosmos at night. They are not, however, the primary
judges of the extispicy, but rather function in a mediating role between the peti-
tioning bārû, together with his client, and the high gods. Specifically, Steinkeller

Adad, as a weather god, is located in the sky. Ishtar and Sin are, obviously, Venus and the
moon, respectively. The prayer seems to have been used, thus, on an evening when neither that
planet nor the moon was visible.𒁹 A N OB P RAYER TO THE G ODS OF THE N IGHT

argues, the stars act as personal advocates of the inquirer. While the high gods,
primarily Shamash and Adad, are ultimately responsible for the verdict ren-
dered, the night gods nonetheless play a vital role for the inquirer who, by the
very choice to engage in such a mantic act, has entered the courtroom of the
most powerful judges in the cosmos. The inquirer desires a truthful and propi-
tious outcome and for this they need all the help they can muster.
The prayer is logically divided into two sections. The first, lines 1–13, de-
scribe the situation: the city is buttoned up and the high gods are unavailable.
Lines 14–24 form the second: the actual invocation of the Gods of the Night in
which they are asked to stand at the ready so that they might assist in the ex-

The text of the prayer is quite well-preserved in two OB copies of unknown
provenance. Variations between these are relatively minor. This treatment fea-
tures the text discovered in 1924 but most recently published by Wayne Horo-
witz in 2000 (= MS A). The second copy (= MS B) was discovered and published
by G. Dossin in 1935, shortly after MS A came to light.

Line 1: Pullulum (D of palālum), “to guard closely.” This form, like several of the verbs
that follow, is a predicative. Predicative verbal constructions predominate in lines 1–4, and
this underscores the inert state of the land as described in the text. This first word of the
prayer has been the subject of significant debate, but it is now generally agreed that this is
the reading, though the form is admittedly unusual, in that the D stem of this root is oth-
erwise unattested (see A. Livingstone, NABU 1990, #86). Rubûm, “prince.”
pullulū rubû
Line 2: Wašārum, “to sink, to let down.” Sikkūrum, “a locking bolt.” Šīrtum (šērtum), “a
locking ring.” For this definition, see A. Livingstone, NABU 1990, #87. Šakānum, “to set,
to place.” Note also that šīrtum is a homophone of šīrtum, “morning.” Perhaps this is a
deliberate word play on the author’s part? For this line, MS B has šikkātum šērētum tabkā,
“the pegs, the locking rings are lying flat.”
wašrū sikkūrū šīrētum šaknā
Line 3: Ḫabrum, “noisy, busy.” Nišum, “people,” usually occurs in the (irregular fem.)
plural, nišū. Šaqummum, “silent,” an adj., is used here predicatively (3fp).
ḫabrātum nišū šaqummā
Line 4: Petûm, “open,” is a verbal adj. Uddulum (D of edēlum), “to shut, to lock.”
Bābum, “gate, door.”
petûtum uddulū bābū
Line 5: Ilum, “god.” We expect ilū (i.e., the expected nominative construct/bound
state) rather than ilī. For the genitive when we expect the nominative, see also mušītim in
line 9 and ilī mušītim in line 14. Mātum, “land.” Ištartum, “goddess.” The proper name of
the goddess, par excellence, is frequently used as a common noun to indicate female gods.

Line 7: Erēbum, “to enter.” This common verb takes on a technical meaning when
referring to a celestial body, such as the sun (i.e., Shamash), the moon, a planet, or star,
namely, “to set.” Utlum, “lap” (utul is the construct/bound form). Šamû, “sky, heaven.” The
word almost always occurs in the plural. Utul šamê refers to the sky’s interior that is not
visible to humanity but in which the gods reside. See Wayne Horowitz, Mesopotamian Cos-
mic Geography (Mesopotamia Civilizations 8; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1998), 250–52 for
discussion.

Line 8: Ul, a particle of negation. Diānum (dânu), “to judge.” Dīnum, “judgment, deci-
sion.” The idiom dīnam diānum indicates a variety of things, including “to (legally) sen-
tence, to render a judgment.” Within the context of this prayer and within divination in
general, this is the act of providing guidance through an oracle. As noted above, the gods’
guidance in mantic practice was considered the rendering of a binding legal decision.
Parāsum, “to cut.” Awātum, “word, matter.” The idiom awātam parāsum is essentially syn-
onymous with dīnam diānum.
ul idinnū dīnam ul iparrasū awātim
Line 9: Pussumum (D of pasāmum, with the same meaning as the G in the predicative),
“to cover, to veil.” Mušītum, “night.” Mušītim is clearly the subject of the D fs predicative
pussumat; however, it is in the genitive case and this might be a scribal error. MS B has mu-
ši-tum here. For the genitive when we expect the nominative, see also lines 5 and 14.
pussumat mušītim
Line 10: É . GAL = ēkallum, “palace.” Šaḫūrum, a kind of ritual building associated with
a larger complex of buildings, is often translated simply as “chapel.” See CAD Š/1, 108–9.
Kummum, “shrine, innermost sanctum, cella.” The term can refer both to a part of a struc-
ture and to a structure in its own right. See CAD K, 533–34. It is undoubtedly in the singu-
lar (no vowel length is indicated in the orthography, though the scribe does not consistent-
ly indicate this), but it lacks the expected mimation. Adārum “to be dark, obscured” (G
3mp predicative). The term is particularly common in celestial divination literature in
which it can refer to the eclipse of the sun or moon, or the obscuration of a star or planet.
See CAD A/1, 103–4 and note, in particular, the usage of adārum in the OB celestial omen
text from the Hermitage (republished in the edition by Horowitz, 204, line 12). The idea
might be that these religious structures, which are the seats of certain deities during the
day are, in a sense, “eclipsed” during the night, when the night gods take over and their
seats, i.e., the stars, etc., are visible.

Line 11: Alākum, “to walk, to go.” Urḫum, “path, road.” How would you translate the
phrase ālik urḫi idiomatically? DINGIR = ilum, “god.” Šasûm, “to call, to shout, to invoke.”
The scribe’s orthography here (i-ša-ši) is defective for the durative form. Instead of išassi,
MS B has uselle (from sullûm), “he appeals to, prays to.” Ša dīnim, though often understood
as the petitioner, clearly must refer to the petitioned god, i.e., dayyānum ša dīnim. See
Dossin’s translation of the same text in MS B: “le tribunal se rassasie de sommeil.” Šutebrûm
(Št of bitrûm [Gt]) “to do permanently, to continue.” The origin of this common but unu-
sual root is difficult; AHw derives it from berûm, “to starve.” See AHw, 123 and CAD B,
279–81. Šittum, “sleep.” Here the accusative case is adverbial.
ālik urḫim ilam išassi u ša dīnim ušteberre šittam
Line 12: Dayyānum, “judge” (dayyān = construct/bound form). Kittum (from kin-
tum*), “truth.” Abum, “father.” Ekūtum, “a destitute girl.” MS B repeats kittum at the end of
the line, replacing ekūtum. The masculine equivalent of the term ekūtum does not occur. As
such it often occurs in parallel with almattum, “widow.” See CAD E, 72–73. Here the epi-
thets dayyān kinātim and abi ekiātim are epithets of the sun god Shamash, mentioned by
name in the next line.
dayyān kinātim abi ekiātim
Line 13: Erēbum, see line 7. Shamash’s kummum here does not seem to be an area of
an earthly shrine, but rather his own private cella in the celestial residence of the gods.
Šamaš īterub ana kummīšu
Line 14: Line 14 begins a long sentence, whose main verb appears in line 21. Rabûm,
“great.” The mp adjective here seems to be acting in apposition to ilī mušītim rather than
serving as an attributive adjective. For ilī as a nominative, see comments to line 5 and 9.

Line 15: Nawrum, “shining, brilliant,” is a common adj. applied to celestial bodies.
= Girra. As mentioned in the introduction, the fire god Girra is the protagonist in
the poorly preserved OB myth called Girra and Elamatum, in which he slays a monster
called Elamatum and makes her into a constellation. In this context, it is important to note
that the constellation Elamatum appears in MS B after qaštum ( MS A line 17) and in the
place of nīrum. Ms B thus features both the protagonist and adversary of the OB myth.

qurādum Erra
Line 17: Qaštum, “bow.” Here qaštum refers to the Bow constellation, probably part of
Canis Major (Reiner and Pingree, 11; Gössmann, #47). This constellation features promi-
nently in Enūma eliš as Marduk’s prized weapon, which is installed in the sky and adopted
by Anu as his own daughter (VI 82–91). That passage is a rare example of catasterism in
Mesopotamian literature. (See also Astrolabe B B1:14–16 [KAV 218] and MUL . APIN I ii 7.)
Nīrum, “yoke.” Otherwise written logographically as ŠUDUN . Nīrum is possibly to be identi-
fied as the constellation Boötes (Reiner and Pingree, 15; Gössmann, #379).
qaštum nīrum
Line 18: MS B begins the line with zappum, literally, “a bristle of hair,” but here a
name for the Pleiades (normally written MUL . MUL ; Reiner and Pingree, 13; Gössmann,
#171 and #279) Šitadarrum, “Orion.” Note also the by-forms šitadallum and šidallum, as
well as the common Sumerian orthography SIPA . ZI . AN . NA (“the true shepherd of heaven”).
The origin and meaning of the Akkadian name is unclear, though Gössmann suggests it is
derived from the verb šadālum, “to be wide,” and means something like “the wide man,
the giant” (Reiner and Pingree, 14; Gössmann, #348). Mušḫuššum, “furious serpent.” This
constellation is only attested in the OB period. It might be the dragon whose origin is de-
scribed in the Labbu Myth (Frans Wiggermann, “Tišpak, his Seal, and the Dragon
Mušhuššu,” in To the Euphrates and Beyond: Archaeological Studies in Honor of Mauits N. van
Loon [ed. O. Haex et al; Rotterdam: A. A. Balkema, 1989], 117–33, esp. 126). Gössmann
equates it with the later constellation MUŠ , though this is by no means certain; if it is the
case, however, it is possibly to be identified with the constellation Hydra (Reiner and
Pingree, 13; Gössmann, #284).

Line 19: GIŠ . MAR . GÍD . DA = ereqqum, “wagon, cart,” is a constellation roughly corre-
sponding to our Ursa Major (Reiner and Pingree, 13; Gössmann, #258). Enzum, “goat,” is
often, though not here, written logographically ÙZ . It is perhaps the constellation Lyra
(Reiner and Pingree, 16; Gössmann #145).

Line 20: Kusarikkum, “bison.” The bison is depicted as a wild monster in Mesopotami-
an conflict mythology, such as Enūma eliš I 143 (see the discussion of monster lists in W. G.

12.7.1985 [ed. K. Hecker and W. Sommerfeld; Berlin: Dietrich Reimer, 1986], 55–59). In
these mythological contexts, however, there is no need to identify kusarrikkum with this
astral manifestation. Bašmum, “horned serpent.” This unidentified constellation is only
attested in the OB period. Though Gössmann (#51) suggested that this be identified as the
constellation Hydra, his proposal is merely a stab in the dark. A bašmum is also featured as
one of the monsters created by Tiamat in Enūma eliš (I 141). In addition to their literary
attestations, these two monsters appear together in Šurpu VIII 6–7 (see Erica Reiner, Šurpu:
A Collection of Sumerian and Akkadian Incantations [AfO Beiheft 11; Graz, 1958], 39). MS B
omits bašmum but adds ilū mušītim rabītim, “gods of the great night.”
kusarikkum bašmum
Line 21: Izuzzum/uzuzzum, “to stand, to make an appearance.” The form is a G 3mp
precative. This root in the precative is quite common in prayers which request a god’s
presence. The scribe mistakenly omitted a ZU sign. MS B has the cp impv. izizzānim here,
thus keeping the person by which the supplicant addresses the deities consistent. See
comment on line 24 below. The enclitic –ma is attached to a volitive/injunctive form and
is followed by another volitive/injunctive form, i.e., šuknān in line 23. Thus, a simple
“and” will not suffice in a translation. It needs to be rendered as indicating a purpose
clause (“so that, in order that”).
lizzizū-ma
Line 22: Têrtum, “extispicy.” The term refers broadly to a report or instruction. But
within this context it is a technical term referring to this particular act of divination.
Epēšum, “to do, to make.” The verb has the subordinating/subjunctive marker –u. The
relative clause is, in this case, not marked by ša. In such unmarked clauses the antecedent
is in the bound/construct state, as is têrti here (see also line 23). Têrtam epēšum is an idiom
meaning, “to perform an extispicy.”
ina têrti eppušu
Line 23: Puḫādum, “lamb.” The word is in the bound/construct state, since it precedes
an unmarked relative clause. MS B has ikribi, “offering.” Karābum, “to offer.” Note again the
subordinating/subjunctive marker –u.
ina puḫād akarrabu
Line 24: Kittum, “truth, justice.” Šakānum, “to place” (cp impv. plus what seems to be
a shortened form of the 1cs dative object [= ventive suffix –nim]). Note that between the
first verb in the sequence, lizzizū-ma (in line 21), and this verb, the author has changed the
person in which the gods are addressed from third person to second. Just as “the locking𒁹 A N OB P RAYER TO THE G ODS OF THE N IGHT

Line 25: MU = šumum, “line, item.” The term most simply means “name,” but in
scribal terminology it indicates an entry or line of text. BI = –šu, 3ms possessive suffix.
MU . BI = šumūšu. MS B omits MU . BI . This term is often found in colophons giving a summary
of the number of lines in the text. Ikribu, “prayer.” The scribe has mistakenly omitted a RI

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Extispicy is quite well-attested in the Late Bronze Levant, both in the north
(i.e., Ugarit) and the south (Hazor) in the form of Babylonian-style liver models. 1
Despite the ample Late Bronze evidence, however, there is no clear evidence for
the practice in Iron Age Israel or Judah. This is not particularly surprising since
the Akkadian Late Bronze hepatoscopic texts outside of Mesopotamia, and the
non-Akkadian ones they inspired at Ugarit, are the result of the international
exportation of Babylonian scholarship that went hand-in-hand with the Babylo-
nian cultural koiné of the Late Bronze Age. When that international use and ap-
preciation of Babylonian knowledge ended in the tumult of the thirteenth to
twelfth centuries, the mantic exports, in many ways the pinnacle of what would
become ummânūtu (expertise in the scribal craft), ceased as well. Thus, Ezek
21:26 is the only mention of the practice in indisputable terms in the Hebrew
Bible. In this case, the prophet is referring to the decision-making of the Babylo-
nian monarch Nebuchadnezzar II, as he plots his military strategy during his
conquest of Canaan. The king “looked at the liver” ( ‫ד‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ‫כּ‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ָ ) in addition to per-
forming an act of belomancy (divination using arrowheads) and consulting tera-
phim. In the prophet’s presentation, Yahweh has guided the results of the mantic
acts so as to lead the king to conquer Jerusalem. Though Yahweh directs these
undertakings, his presence in them is described as something exceptional—the
1
Twenty-two models of exta, including the inscribed liver models (KTU 1.141, 1.142, 1.143,
1.144, 1.155, and an inscribed lung model, 1.127) have been uncovered at Ugarit (see M. Die-
trich and O. Loretz et al., Mantik in Ugarit: Keilalphabetische Texte der Opferschau, Omensammlun-
gen, Nekromantie [ALASP 3; Münster: Ugarit Verlag, 1990], 5–38) while three inscribed and three
uninscribed fragmentary liver models dating to roughly the Old Babylonian/Middle Babylonian
periods have been discovered at Hazor (W. Horowitz et al., Cuneiform in Canaan: Cuneiform
Sources from the Land of Israel in Ancient Times [Jerusalem: Israel Exploration Society/Hebrew
University, 2006], 66–68 and Wayne Horowitz, et al, “Hazor 17: Another Clay Liver Model,” IEJ
60 (2010), 133–45).80Judahites, the prophet tells us, believe the results of Nebuchadnezzar’s divina-
tions are false by their very nature (Ezek 21:28).
Despite the lack of Iron Age archaeological evidence and textual witness,
several scholars have argued that extispicy was practiced in ancient Israel and
Judah. Sigmund Mowinckel claims that certain Psalms were, in fact, oracle ques-
tions posed to Yahweh before the ritual slaughter of an animal whose exta were
to be examined. 2 Specifically, based on its usage in 2 Kgs 16:15 and Ps 5:4,
Mowinckel makes the case that the verb ‫בקר‬ (normally translated “to inquire”) is
a technical term referring to performing an extispicy. 3 Otto Loretz, building on
Mowinckel’s study and citing the liver models from Ugarit as precedent, posits
that the “signs,” ‫אֹתוֹת‬ , mentioned in Ps 74:4, 9 are, in fact, liver omina. 4 Freder-
ick Cryer, looking at the time, location, equipment, procedure, language, and
personnel described in the various descriptions of (condoned) divination in the
Hebrew Bible, maintains that these accounts are modeled on NA extispicy re-
ports and queries and implies that, under the heavily edited biblical narratives
which report them, lies buried the remains of an Israelite hepatoscopic tradi-
tion. 5 Anne Jeffers considers whether the participle ‫ד‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ , “sheep-tender” (used
only twice in the Hebrew Bible, 2 Kgs 3:4 and Amos 1:1), might refer to one
who not only raises sheep, but was actually involved in sacrifice and mantic
liver examination. 6
All of these proposals share certain elementary problems. Why are there no
models of exta known from Iron Age sites in Israel and Judah, though they are
attested in the Late Bronze Age? Why, if the biblical authors use specific tech-
nical terminology to refer to hepatoscopy (i.e., ‫בקר‬ and ‫ד‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ , as per Mowinckel,
Loretz and Jeffers) do they not employ that terminology when referring to the
practice in Ezek 21:26? Even if it is because they reject the foreign, but not do-
mestic, practice of extispicy, the biblical authors are perfectly willing to call
other illegitimate diviners by native technical terms (e.g., prophets of other dei-
ties: 1 Kgs 18:19; 2 Kgs 10:19; Jer 2:8; 23:13; false prophets of Yahweh: 1 Kgs

Frederick Cryer, Divination in Ancient Israel and its Near Eastern Environment: A Socio-Historical
Investigation (JSOTSup 142; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1994), 298–305. Notably, while Cryer astutely
rejects the methods of Mowinckel (296) and Loretz (296–98), he accepts their conclusion that
extispicy was known and practiced in ancient Israel. The fundamental problem with Cryer’s
argument is that all mantic acts include the elements named above to a high degree since all
divinatory acts are rituals conducted by special personnel, which respond in time and place to
specific situations! Celestial divination, for example, for which we also have extensive reports
dating to the NA period, mention all, some, or many of these elements. This does not mean that
the biblical narrative, and ultimately the real practice which lies behind it, is based on Babyloni-
an or native Israelite celestial divination.

22:6). Why the unwillingness in this case? Why, if hepatoscopy was practiced in
Israel and Judah, only later to be condemned and its overt mention eradicated
from the biblical text, is it not mentioned in the list of prohibited diviners in
Deut 18:10–11? Ultimately, all arguments in favor of Israelite and Judahite ex-
tispicy are highly speculative.
Functionally speaking, we are also at a loss to find biblical parallels for this
prayer. While there are several acceptable means of divination in the biblical
tradition, i.e., prophecy, cleromancy, oneiromancy (see 1 Sam 28:6), and quite a
few forbidden ones (Deut 18:10–11), we have no Israelite or Judahite preparato-
ry prayers made for these acts, other than the specific questions posited (e.g., 1
Sam 30:8; 1 Kgs 22:6; and perhaps Psalms 4, 60, 108, 119 and 143). The He-
brew Bible contains narrative descriptions of divination and often its results—
but it is not a diviner’s manual and contains no traces of one. One wonders if
any mantic technical literature (e.g., lists of dream omens or rules for lots), other
than the results of prophecy, was ever committed to writing in Israel and Judah
or if the divinatory traditions were ultimately and exclusively oral.
The thrust of the prayer is a plea for an accurate, truthful extispicy, guided
by the gods. And, though we have no divinatory manuals from ancient Israel,
within the Hebrew Bible we can observe a certain amount of anxiety regarding
the truthfulness of an oracle. According to Deut 18:21–22, a prophet of Yahweh
can only be judged legitimate if the oracles he delivers come to fruition. When
making a decision, of course, it is not much good to know after the fact whether
the oracle relays the truth. Thus, in 1 Kgs 22, the king of Judah, Jehoshaphat,
asks for a second prophetic opinion regarding the joint Judahite-Israelite mili-
tary expedition against Ramoth-Gilead. When the prophet Micaiah ben Imlah is
summoned, his initial oracle confirms the previous one offered unanimously by
four-hundred prophets. But the king of Israel is incredulous and demands that
the prophet offer him the truth in Yahweh’s name (1 Kgs 22:16, ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫ת‬ ‫מ‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ֱ ).
The truthful oracle is decidedly negative and the vision of Yahweh’s court that
the lone prophet recounts indicates that the deity was, in fact, guiding the oracle
of the four-hundred prophets—but not with the truth! Instead, Yahweh deliber-
ately misled the kings by dispatching a “false spirit” ( ‫ר‬ ‫ק‬ ֶ ‫שׁ‬ ֶ ‫רוּח‬
, 1 Kgs 22:22–23).
Though theologically upsetting to many ancient and modern readers, 1 Kgs 22
sheds light on our prayer by revealing that the plea for a truthful extispicy might
not merely be a plea for divine mediation and accuracy in the extispicy proce-
dure, but also a plea for the gods to be honest in guiding their servants!
While there are no real functional parallels in the Hebrew Bible, the concept
that an oracle was a legal decision does have some analogies. It has been noted
since at least the days of Gunkel and Begrich that certain oracles are framed as
lawsuits, i.e., the so-called Gerichtsrede (“Judgment Speech/Oracle”). 7 As stated
above, in the Prayer to the Gods of the Night the night gods serve as an advocate
7
Hermann Gunkel and Joachim Begrich, Introduction to the Psalms: The Genres of the Religious
Lyric of Israel (trans. J. Nogalski; Macon: Mercer University Press, 1998), 279–80.82of the inquirer. In the biblical Judgment Oracle, it is the prophet himself who
acts as a mediator, but in these cases he is representing the plaintiff, i.e., Yah-
weh (e.g., Isa 1:2–20; Mic 6:1–8), and the cosmos acts as witness. 8 Such oracles,
like our prayer, employ legal terminology and concepts, such as “lawsuit” (Mic
6:1, ‫יב‬ ‫)ר‬ ִ and the calling of witnesses, “Listen, O Sky, and pay attention, O Earth,
for Yahweh hereby speaks!” (Isa 1:2a, ‫ר‬ ‫בּ‬ ֵ ‫דּ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫ינוּ‬ ִ‫ז‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫ה‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫עוּ‬ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ). While
this is hardly a profound correlation, it demonstrates that, unsurprisingly, in
both our prayer and certain biblical pericopes the writers conceived of the invis-
ible administration of divine-human relationships in mundane legal terms with
which they were quite familiar.

An OB Ikribu-Like Prayer to Shamash and Adad
A LAN L ENZI
S HAMASH :
See page 197.
A DAD :
Adad (also, Ḫaddu, Ḫadda, Addu, Adda) is the Semitic name of the ancient
Near Eastern storm god par excellence who was responsible for storms, thunder,
lightning, wind, and rain. Worship of this god extended across the entire ancient
Near East under various other names, such as Ishkur (Sum.), Teshub (Hurrian),
Baʿlu (Ugaritic), and Taru/Tarḫun(t) (Hattic/Hittite-Luwian). In Mesopotamian
traditions, he was the son of Anu or sometimes Enlil, his consort was Shala
(identified with Sum. Medimsha), and his ministers were Shullat and Ḫanish.
Iconographically, Adad was represented by a lion-dragon in third millennium
sources and a bull by OB times. In anthropomorphic depictions, he is frequently
found holding a weapon or a lightning bolt, as if ready to strike an opponent in
battle. Although his name is usually written with the logogram IŠKUR , a sign that
can be read as the Sumerian word im, “wind,” one also finds it written syllabi-
cally in Akkadian and sometimes logographically as d 10 .
Adad was syncretized to the Sumerian storm god Ishkur during the Sargonic
and Ur III periods (i.e., the late third millennium) and became a major power in
the Mesopotamian pantheon by OB times. His shrines and temples were quite
numerous throughout Mesopotamia, Syria (e.g., at Ebla, Mari, Emar, Ḫalab, and
Ugarit), and beyond, extending chronologically from Early Dynastic to Hellenis-
tic times. Prominent examples of sanctuaries include the double Anu-Adad tem-
ple in Ashur, dating back to the reign of Shamshi-Adad I, and Adad’s most im-
portant Babylonian shrine—according to first millennium sources—located at
Zabban (90km east of the Tigris and 175km southeast of Ashur).
Given Adad’s sphere of power, it can be no surprise that he was both pro-
ductive and destructive to humans, bringing abundance, on the one hand, via
8586rain that watered crops and animals (see, e.g., Atram-ḫasīs II i 11–16, 30–33), 1
and wreaking devastation, on the other, with powerful storms and floods (see,
e.g., Atram-ḫasīs III ii 48–55). 2 Due to the latter association, Adad was an im-
portant war god, especially evident among Middle and Neo-Assyrian sources.
Along with his role as a storm god, Adad was also a guardian of oaths. In
Sippar, for example, he was closely associated with Shamash, who together with
Adad was invoked to bear witness to legal cases and contracts. This must be
significant for their association in divinatory texts, attested as early as OB
times. 3
To explain Adad’s rather unexpected role in oracular divination, Daniel
Schwemer offers two suggestions. First, Adad “was a celestial god who . . . had
power over numerous ominous phenomena and dwelled in immediate proximity
to the celestial sun-god.” And second, he “was lord of the winds, which were
seen in Mesopotamia as the divine carriers,” 4 perhaps thereby providing the
means to communicate the extispicy verdict to the human diviner. 5
T HE P RAYER :
This OB prayer was used in the diviner’s extispicy ritual to petition the high
gods in charge of the oracular decision: Shamash and Adad. (It is closely associ-
ated with the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night, see page 71). After the diviner
had gathered the gods via this prayer and made them amenable to hear inquir-
ies, the diviner may have made his inquiry in the form of a tamitu-prayer (see
page 465). In order to learn the answer to his inquiry, the diviner would exam-
ine the animal sacrificed in the extispicy and read the signs that the gods had
placed in its exta. In this way, the diviner could learn the will of the gods in the
matter about which he had inquired.
The prayer falls into two main parts. In the first ten lines the diviner under-
takes his ritual purification. 6 In the remainder of the text (lines 11–66), the di-
viner performs six more ritual actions, directed at Shamash alone, and asks
Shamash, 7 sometimes including Adad, eight times in the course of the prayer to

Shamash is mentioned seventeen times in the text: 1, 11, 14, 19, 21, 24, 25, 26, 34, 36, 42, 44,
50, 51, 54, 55, and 58. Adad is mentioned only six times: lines 11, 27, 36, 44, 51, 55, always in
tandem with an invocation of Shamash. Only Shamash is invoked at the beginning of each of
seven ritual actions described in the text (see lines 1, 14, 19, 25, 34, 42, 50; and Starr, 46).𒁹𒁹 A N OB I KRIBU -L IKE P RAYER TO S HAMASH AND A DAD
87
“place the truth” (kittam šuknam) in the extispicy offering (see lines 13, 18, 33,
41, 49, 53, 57, 66; see also the OB prayer to the Gods of the Night, line 24 [see
page 78]). In other words, the diviner asks the deity to answer his oracular ques-
tion with a firm reply via the placing of a sign in the exta of the animal being
sacrificed (see YOS 11 23:16). 8
The preparations mentioned in lines 1–10 apparently form a rite of purifica-
tion (see line 9), making the diviner worthy to approach the place of extispicy,
the place to which the gods are summoned. 9 Cedar plays a major role in this
process of purification but the precise significance of its various uses is not at all
clear. One assumes the aromatic qualities of cedar or cedar resin figure into the
process somehow.
The remainder of the prayer is highly repetitive, but its presentation shows
a very clear logic. Lines 11–66 describe the ritual preparations of a meal for the
gods (see Starr, 57): incense makes the air pleasant to smell, 10 water is offered
for washing the hands, food is laid out, and the guests are announced. 11 After the
initial preparation (incense and water, lines 11–24), the gods are to come to the
table, eat, sit on thrones, and render a judgment (see lines 29–30, 38–39, and
45b–48a). In or during their meal the gods, now present and happily sated by
their repast, were requested to leave a sign in the sacrificed animal in response
to the diviner’s oracular inquiry, perhaps asked after this prayer in the form of a
tamitu-prayer. The diviner would then find and interpret the sign in the animal’s
exta to learn the gods’ decision.
The present prayer is similar to the ikribu-prayers discussed in the general
introduction (see page 46), even being included among a list of such prayers by
Mayer (UFBG, 32, n.63). Yet it is not an ikribu-prayer, properly speaking. As
Starr writes:
The OB Prayer . . . deviates in form from the standard ikribu. It does not begin
with the opening formula . . . , but with a vivid description of how the diviner
uses cedar (resin, most likely) for purposes of cultic purification, and the whole
ritual (lines 1–10) is addressed to Šamaš alone. Only the second unit (line 11ff.)

tion.

the Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia,” in Ritual and Sacrifice in the Ancient Near East (ed. J.

tion “The Care and Feeding of the Gods” in his Ancient Mesopotamia: Portraits of a Dead Civiliza-
tion (rev. Erica Reiner; Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977), 183–98.88opens with the introductory formula of the ikribus. Here too, the text deviates
from the latter by placing the closing formula (ina ikrib akarrabu, etc.) imme-
diately after the opening formula (line 12). In short, while the OB Prayer is con-
structed along the lines of an ikribu, employing identical formulas and describing
a set of activities of the diviner, it bears neither the title ikribu, nor does it em-
ploy the (opening and closing) formulas in the orthodox manner. . . . From this
we should draw the conclusion that not all prayers of the diviner are ikribus, alt-
hough they may appear to be so. 12

Line 1: UTU = Šamaš, the sun god. Notice the brief invocation. The diviner regularly
came before Shamash and Adad during extispicies. Perhaps this familiarity explains the
lack of an elaborate hymnic introduction (salutation). Alternatively, one could suggest that
ritual acts (and their description in the prayer) serve as the introductory motif. The diviner
shows himself to be ritually prepared to meet with the gods of divination. Šakānum, “to

whether the diviner put the actual cedar wood or only cedar resin in his mouth (see CAD
E, 279 for this general ambiguity). Ellum, “pure, clear.”
Šamaš ašakkan ana pīya erēnam ellam
Line 2: Goetze read the first word as a-ṣa-ni-ip-ku, but there is no known root
*ṣanāpum in Akkadian. As others have since recognized, the verb is sanābum (or sanāpum),
“to tie” (see CAD S, 132–33). The pronominal suffix on the verb is a 2ms dative without
mimation, as also in lines 8 and 54 (compare line 3). Ina, “in, on, by, from, with.” Itqum,
“fleece, tuft, lock (of hair).” Pērtum (pirtum), “hair (of head).” According to CAD P, 415,
itiq pērtim means “forelock,” which refers to the hair that covers one’s forehead. The object
of the verb must be implied from context (see lines 1 and 7). It is not clear what exactly
the diviner is doing with his hair. Is he tying a piece of cedar into his hair or is he using a
piece of his hair as a binding?
asannibku ina itiq pērtīya
Line 3: The verb from line 1 is repeated here, but this time it has the 2ms pronominal
suffix (with mimation). The text’s a-ša-ka-an-ku-um is a morphographemic writing since
the final radical of the root, n, would have assimilated to the following consonant in
speech (–nk– becomes –kk–). Sūnum, “lap, loin.”
ašakkakkum ina sūnīya
Line 4: The meaning of šabium (šabû) is unknown. Goetze translates it as “compact”
(with a note on 27–28) while Foster renders it “bushy,” but the lexica do not even attempt
a gloss. It seems to describe cedar somehow, either as a substantive in construct, a preced-
ing adjective, or an appositive. See CAD Š/1, 17 for a brief discussion. In any case, this line
provides the object of the verb in line 3.
šabiam erēnam
Line 5: Mesûm, “to wash, to purify.” U, “and.” Qātum, “hand.” Notice the verbs in this
line and the next two have changed to preterites (from the previous duratives). These may
indicate that the diviner purified himself before the prayer in preparation to meet with the
gods. Washing the hands and mouth as a ritual preparation is found relatively frequently
in the Mesopotamian ritual materials. One did not want to offend the gods with filthy
hands and bad breath (see van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction, 33–34).

Line 7: See lines 1 and 2. How the action here relates to the action of line 2 is un-
clear. Does the diviner repeat in line 2 during the prayer the action that he had already
done prior to speaking it (recounted here)?
asnib erēnam ellam ina itiq pērtīya
Line 8: Goetze read the first word as al-ta-ba-ak-ku but this did not supply adequate
sense. As Seux notes (467), Erica Reiner suggested the present reading, deriving the verb
from šapākum, “to heap up, to pile, to pour on.” The form is a 1cs perfect. Again, we see
the 2ms dative pronominal suffix without mimation.
altappakku šabiam erēnam
Line 9: The form of ellum is a 1cs predicative. Puḫrum, “assembly.” Ilum, “god.”
Ṭeḫûm, “to approach, to be(come) near to.” It is unclear whether the prepositional phrase
in this line should be read with the first or the second verb, but the meaning, on either
reading, is very similar. Having completed his preparations, the diviner is in a state of
purity. He may now approach the divine assembly for their decision (see line 10). The
prayer is performative in that his speaking it initiates his approach.
ellēku ana puḫur ilī eṭeḫḫi
Line 10: Dīnum, “decision, judgment.” The diviner purifies himself and ritually enters
the divine assembly to obtain their decision with regard to his inquiry. The answer, of
course, is delivered via extispicy.
ana dīnim
Line 11: The diviner renews the invocation but now includes Adad (= d IŠKUR ) with
Shamash. Bēlum, “lord.” Ikribum generally means “prayer, blessing,” but see the next line.
The word is best taken here as a plural. Bīrum, “divination” (both the act of extispicy and
the answer received). Goetze (25) suggests the missing mimation on this final word of the
line is due to the lack of space on the tablet. This is the only instance where it is missing
(see otherwise lines 27, 37, 45, 52, and 56). The epithets bēl dīnim and bēl bīrim are ap-
plied to Shamash and Adad a millennium later in the SB tamitu-prayers (see Lambert,
Babylonian Oracle Questions and page 465 in this book) and ikribu-prayers (see Zimmern,
BBR, nos. 75–101 [pp. 190–219]).

Line 12: Karābum, “to pray, to bless, to greet,” generally, but with its cognate,
ikribum, the idiom means “to utter a prayer, a blessing,” and probably refers here to “the
ritual-cum-prayer part, i.e., the various cultic activities and prayers associated with the
ritual of the diviner, which are usually described in the subscript to each ikribu” (Starr,
50). Têrtum, “message, instruction, omen, extispicy.” The gods make their will known via
the têrtum that they place on the exta of the sheep. With the verb epēšum, “to do, to make,”
the idiom means “to perform an extispicy” (Starr, 50). In both phrases that comprise our
line, we do not simply have a verb and its object. Rather, we have a prepositional phrase
whose substantive is the object of the verb to which it is bound (thereby forming brief
relative clauses): “in the X, which I do.” This explains the subjunctive –u on both verbs.
ina ikrib akarrabu ina têrti ēpušu
Line 13: Kittum, “truth.” Šuknam is the ms imperative of šakānum with a ventive. This
statement, which appears numerous times throughout the prayer, is “an appeal for the
manifestation of the oracular verdict” (Starr, 58).
kittam šuknam
Line 14: Qutrēnum (qutrīnum, qutrinnum), “incense.” Pî qutrēnim is obscure, though it
may refer to the opening of the flask containing incense (see Seux, 468, n.10). Foster takes
qutrēnim as the object of the verb. But this understanding must assume a mistaken case
vowel on qutrēnim. In any case, the diviner again invokes Shamash and places pure cedar
(see line 15) “to the mouth” of something, as in line 1.
Šamaš ašakkan ana pî qutrēnim
Line 15: The restoration in this line follows CAD Q, 324. Ša, “which,” introduces a
brief relative clause that further describes the pî qutrēnim in line 14. Maḫrīka, “before you,
in front of you.” Erēnam ellam is the direct object of the verb in line 14. (W)ašābum, “to sit,
to dwell, to reside.” When used with smoke-like things, “linger” seems an appropriate
translation of the verb (see Goetze, 26 and Foster, 209). Goetze suggests the missing mi-
mation on the final noun is simply due to the lack of space on the tablet (see 25).
ša maḫrīka erēnam ellam lišib qutrēnu
Line 16: Qerûm, “to call, to invite.” The ventive on the precative indicates the diviner
wishes to summon the gods to his present location. The subject of the verb should be un-
derstood as the incense mentioned in the previous line. As Goetze has written, “[t]he fra-
grance of the burned cedar is supposed to stay for a while and to bring the gods to the9217. i-na ik-ri-ib a-ka-ra-bu i-na te-er-ti e-pu-šu

Line 19: The invocation is renewed yet again, though only to Shamash. Našûm, “to lift
up, to raise.” Goetze reads the text as if the verb were a durative with a 2ms dative pro-
nominal suffix, anaššīkum. But the copy (YOS 11 22:19) does not show an initial A. Before
positing a scribal omission, one should note that the same orthography appears in lines 25,
34, 42, and 50 (thus the understanding of the same verb in line 25 by CAD L, 206, <a>-
na-ši-ku-um, is atomistic and unlikely; see a different solution in CAD P, 408 on line 42). As
Goetze has suggested for line 25, na-ši-ku-um stands here for našiākkum, an apocopated 1cs
predicative with 2ms dative suffix. In support of this, he writes, “[t]he corresponding form
with plural suffix na-ši-a-ku-nu-ši-im is actually found in AO 7032 (RA 38 87 [see now
Starr, 122:2]) and from there to be restored in YBT XI 2 obv.2” [=YOS 11 2:2, for which
see Starr, 30:2] (29). Even if Goetze is correct, we do not know why the scribe used this
odd orthography in all four instances of the verb in this text. Mû (always pl.), “water.”

Line 20: The relative ša refers back to mê in line 19. Ištu, “from, out of.” Šadûm,
“mountain(s).” GIŠ . ŠU . ÚR . MÌN = šurmēnum, “cypress.” Goetze’s GIŠ . SU - ÚR - MÌN in the text (26)
is corrected in the notes (29). Cedar and cypress occur together frequently in rituals of the
diviner (see Goetze, 29).
ša ištu šadîm erēnam u šurmēnam
Line 21: Kâšim is the 2ms independent dative pronoun, “to, for you.” Babālum, “to
carry, to bring.” The verb is a transitive parsāku form—identical in appearance to the pre-
dicative; cedar and cypress (from line 20) are its direct objects. It ends the subordinate
clause begun with the ša in line 20. Mutassûm (Dt of mesûm), “to wash oneself.” Mutissi is a
ms imperative. Qurādum, “hero, warrior.” The washing here and in the next couple of lines
is in preparation for eating the sacrificial meal that the diviner lays out before the gods.

Bunene is the chief minister (and sometimes son) of Shamash (see Goetze, 29, citing Zim-
mern, BBR 1–20, line 105 [p. 102]: Bunene sukkal Šamaš u Aya, “Bunene, vizier of Sha-
mash and Aya”). Našparum, “messenger, envoy.” The form of the noun is due to the fact
that the word is bound to kittim in the following line.
u attā mutessi Bunene našpar
Line 24: Although kittum means “truth,” its being bound to a preceding noun (našpar
in line 23) as it is here might be better rendered in English with an adj. preceding the
translation of našpar. Thus, instead of the literalistic “messenger of truth,” one might trans-
late the construction as “reliable messenger.” Maḫar is the bound form of maḫrum used in
line 15. Bunene is to wash himself in front of Shamash. Dayyānum, “judge.” Shamash’s role
as judge is quite typical. He decides the case put before the gods in the form of an ex-
tispicy.

Line 25: For the verb na-ši-ku-um, see line 19. Liqtum, “gathered material, selection, a
quality item, gift.” Luqut is an imperative, probably derived from laqātum, “to pick up, to
gather, to collect.” This is the understanding of our line in CAD L, 206 (under liqtu). Odd-
ly, the entry for laqātu in the CAD does not cite our line. The direct object of the impera-
tive follows in line 26.
Šamaš našîkkum ? liqtam luqut
Line 26: Mû, see line 19. Saskûm (sasqûm) is a fine flour, often used in rituals. Mê
saskîm can be drunk (see CAD S, 193). It is probably, therefore, some kind of liquid con-
coction comprised of saskû-flour and water that one can drink or pour out as a libation
offering. Ellūtim is plural and therefore must modify mê not saskîm.

(notice that the participle is singular), whose divine dining furniture is made from precious
materials. But given Adad’s secondary position in this prayer, perhaps the participles are
best understood as describing Shamash (see also the series of 2ms verbs that follow this
line).
wāšib kussî ḫurāṣim ākil paššur uqnîm
Line 29: All three verbs in this line are G 2ms duratives, derived from (w)arādum, “to
go down, to descend,” akālum, “to eat,” and (w)ašābum, respectively. Although the verbs
sound descriptive here, simply telling us what the god is going to do, these words are in
fact directed at the god. They are probably best understood as telling the god what he is
supposed to do (see Foster’s translation, 210). Likewise for the verb in line 30.
turradam takkal tuššab
Line 30: The opening prepositional phrase describes where Shamash (Adad?) is to sit
(see line 29). Diānum (dânu), “to judge, to render a verdict.” Note the cognate accusative
in the second half of the line.

ter translates the word as “courtyard” (210), citing Andrew George as his source (211), but
it is unclear what actually stands behind that suggestion. One would presume kisallu,
“courtyard,” but its logogram does not fit the sign we have in the copy unless we suppose
KISAL ! . In the gap at the end of the line, we expect a verb in the subjunctive, as in lines 21
and 43. But it is unclear what this verb should be.

Line 42: This line begins as lines 19 and 25 did. Mutqûm, “sweet bread.” 7 = sebettum
(the free form of the number; sebet[ti] is its absolute form) with masculine nouns. Since
there are still unsolved issues with the pronunciation and syntax of numbers, the normali-
zation given here is an approximation. By “seven and seven,” the text means seven pairs.

Line 43: The reading and syntax of this line follows N. Ghanem, “OB Divination Pray-
er YOS XI 22:42–43,” NABU 2012, #18. Ša refers back to mutqû. The meaning of perkum
(pirkum) is unclear. In other contexts, the word may refer to a transverse line or the chord
of a circle (in mathematical texts), a part of a gate, or a region/territory. Foster (210) sug-
gests “row” for its meaning here (likewise Seux, 469, n.16), which seems contextually
appropriate. As the word is in the accusative, Ghanem proposes to read it adverbially,96

modifying the verb parākum, “to lie across transversely” (here a 3mp predicative). The
next word, šina, “two,” is likewise to be understood adverbially (“by twos”). Thus, perkī
šina may indicate a dual row-like arrangement of the bread. Until perku is clarified, how-
ever, the precise arrangement will remain unclear.

tified as grain.

Line 54: Ušnālku is a 1cs Š durative with a 2ms dative pronominal suffix (without

in the Š stem means “to make someone lie down, sleep, to lay something down.” For the
remainder of the line, see the notes on lines 50–51.

Line 58: The copy shows that the scribe has mistakenly added an UM to the end of
the line. Goetze believes this UM should have been placed at the end of qurādu, which is
lacking mimation (see 25, n.1 and 27, n.9). Šib is the ms imperative of (w)ašābum. Lišbū is
the 3mp precative of the same verb (compare the 3cs in line 15). The subject is announced
in line 59. Qurādum, see line 21.

Line 61: Nergal is a chthonic deity, who rules over pestilence and war (see page 339).
Bēl X is a common construction in Akkadian. When referring to humans bēl may designate
a person responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows, whether an office, object, or
something more abstract (see CAD B, 198; e.g., bēl šutummi, “steward of the storehouse,”
bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” or bēl dabābi, “adversary” [lit. “owner of a lawsuit”]). Similarly
with deities (see CAD B, 193). For example, Ea is called bēl pirištim, “lord of the secret
council,” in an OB text from Malgium. The phrase bēl kakkī, “lord of weapons,” identifies
Nergal quite appropriately as an expert wielder of weapons.
Nergal bēl kakkī
Line 62: d INANA = Ištar. Ishtar was the goddess of war and sex (see page 169). Bēltum,
“lady,” is the feminine form of bēlum and implies the same idea of power and authority as
that of its masculine form. Tāḫāzum, “battle, combat.” Bēlet tāḫāzim is a common epithet
for Ishtar (see CAD T, 47).
Ištar bēlet tāḫāzim
Line 63: For the verb, see line 58. Lines 60–63 compare to lines 58b–59. In the latter,
the verb comes first, followed by the prepositional phrase and subject. In lines 60–63 we
have the exact opposite order: the compound subject is in lines 60–62 with the verb and
prepositional phrase following in line 63.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The suggestions offered in the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night (see page
79) supply a broad comparative view on the issue of extispicy and divination.
The following will focus on two particular issues only briefly: the use of cedar in
Mesopotamian and biblical rituals and the idea of humans feeding the gods.
Given the concerns for ritual purity among religious leaders the world over,
it is not at all surprising that both ancient Mesopotamian and biblical texts spec-𒁹𒁹 A N OB I KRIBU -L IKE P RAYER TO S HAMASH AND A DAD
99
ify the need for ritual officials to purify themselves before engaging in ritual
activities. The means to do so in both cultures were very often similar. For ex-
ample, washing with water, shaving, and laundering one’s clothing were means
of purification in both Mesopotamian and biblical texts. 1 What is distinctive
when comparing Mesopotamian and biblical materials with regard to cedar (and
its products) is just how different the two cultures treated this kind of wood. In
Mesopotamia, cedar and its resin were used fairly frequently in ritual and medi-
cal texts as a material for figurines and a ritual substance, whether burned as
incense or rubbed on/held in one’s body as a purifying agent (see CAD E, 276–
79). It is striking that the biblical ritual corpora preserve only a few references
to the role of cedar (BH ‫ז‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫)א‬.
Only in the rituals for the purification of “leprosy”
(i.e., scale disease, Lev 14) and corpse contamination (the red heifer ritual, Num
19) does cedar play a role (see Lev 14:4, 6, 49, 51, 52 and Num 19:6). And even
in these two cases cedar is quite secondary, a mere additive to the blood that
acts as the real ritual detergent. In fact, Milgrom goes so far as to say that cedar
was chosen for these particular rituals because of its reddish color and thus its
association with blood (note also the use of a crimson yarn). 2 There is no indica-
tion that such a symbolic association between blood and cedar existed in Meso-
potamia. 3 Rather, one gets the impression that it was the aromatic nature of the
wood that commended its ritual use.
Our prayer very clearly sets up a meal for the gods, around which they
gather, eat, and then pronounce judgment. This explicitly anthropomorphic rep-
resentation of the gods eating a meal has a close counterpart in the sacrificial
practices depicted throughout the Hebrew Bible. Although a full presentation is
not possible here, a few key pieces of evidence will make the case rather clear.
Yahweh was offered a combination of meat, grain, and wine—things that look
very much like the elements of a meal—every morning and evening (see Exod
29:38–42). The sacrifices and offerings prescribed by ritual texts are often called
“food” (‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֶ ‫ל‬,
e.g., Lev 3:11, 16, 21:6, 8, 21, 22, and 28:2, 24). Yahweh’s altar is
sometimes called a table (see Mal 1:7, where there is the mention of food [‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֶ ‫]ל‬
and a parallel between ‫י‬ ‫ח‬ ִ ‫בּ‬ ְ ְ‫ז‬ ‫מ‬ ִ and ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ן‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫;שׁ‬
see also v. 12). Finally, Yahweh’s
offerings are very frequently described as a “pleasing aroma” to him ( ‫יחוֹח‬
ִ‫נ‬ ‫יח‬ ַ ‫;ר‬ ֵ
see Gen 8:21; Exod 29:18, 25, 41; Lev 1:9, 13, 17, 2:2, 9, 12, 3:5, 16, 4:31, 6:15,
21, 8:21, 28, 17:6, 23:13, 18; Num 15:3, 7, 10, 13, 14, 24, 18:17, Num 28:2, 6,
8, 13, 24, 27, and 29:2, 6, 8, 13, 36). Although there are very vocal statements
(that get a lot of attention from modern scholars) in opposition to the view (see,
e.g., the strong statement in Ps 50:12–14 and prophetic critiques in, e.g., Isa

For a general and comparative discussion of purity in Mesopotamian and biblical sources, see
van der Toorn, Sin and Sanction, 27–36. For a thorough discussion of ritual purity in the legisla-
tion of the Hebrew Bible, especially the pentateuchal Priestly Source, see David P. Wright, “Un-
clean and Clean (OT),” ABD 4.729–41.

Jacob Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (AB 3; New
York: Doubleday, 1991), 835.

But as blood did not factor significantly into Mesopotamian rituals, this is not unexpected.1001:11–14, 4 Jer 7:21–13, Amos 5:21–25, and Mic 6:6–8), it seems unavoidable to
conclude that at least for some biblical authors sacrifices provided Yahweh with
food. 5
4
Note, however, the use of the word ‫שׂבע‬, “to be sated,” in Isa 1:11, a word generally used of
being sated with food and drink.
See the discussion in Gary A. Anderson, “Sacrifice and Sacrificial Offerings (OT),” ABD 5:870–
86, especially 872 and 881–82.

An OB Letter-Prayer to Ninmug
A LAN L ENZI
N INMUG :
We know very little about Ninmug, if that is the correct reading of her
name. 1 She was a minor goddess in Mesopotamia, often associated with crafts-
manship and birth. In some traditions, including our text, Ninmug is the wife of
Ishum/Ḫendursaga. In Enki and the World Order, line 406, she is mentioned
among several other goddesses as a sister of Enki (Akk. Ea). A handful of early
texts bears witness to Ninmug’s cult at Mesopotamian sites such as Fara, perhaps
Kisiga, Adab, Lagash, and Umma. Several Old Babylonian cylinder seal legends
and the present letter-prayer indicate that her veneration continued into the
second millennium. 2
T HE P RAYER :
As the opening few lines make clear, this short prayer was written in episto-
lary form. The language in the opening displays the same kind of social hierar-
chy as one might find in a letter addressed to royalty by a loyal subject: “your
servant” (waradki) writes to “my lady” (bēltīya). Unlike many other prayers in
this volume that contain long preliminary praise or extensive lamentation and
petition, this letter-prayer gets to the point rather quickly (lines 5–7). Ninmug is
simply asked to intercede on behalf of Ninurta-qarrad, the (male) supplicant,
with her husband, Ishum. Apparently the supplicant believes Ishum is the one
who has the authority to change his situation. It is not at all atypical for a god-
1
See Cavigneaux and Krebernik, 471.
According to Cavigneaux and Krebernik this early goddess may be related to a later male deity,
d
Nin-MUG (473). This later deity, whose name is probably to be read d Nin-zadim, played a role in
the Mīs pî ritual complexes. See Christopher Walker and Michael Dick, The Induction of the Cult
Image in Ancient Mesopotamia: The Mesopotamian Mīs Pî Ritual (SAALT 1; Helsinki: The Neo-
Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2001), 23, n.69 and throughout; see also Angelika Berlejung, Die
Theologie der Bilder: Herstellung und Einweihung von Kultbildern in Mesopotamien und die alttesta-
mentliche Bilderpolemik (OBO 162; Freiburg: Universitätsverlag / Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &
Ruprecht, 1998), 126.

105106dess to intercede with a god she can influence (line 4) on behalf of a supplicant
(see, e.g., the prayer to Gula on page 243).
Interestingly, more than half of the prayer (lines 8–19) consists of the sup-
plicant’s promise to give thanks to the goddess after she has interceded for him
(notice the inūma, “when, at that time,” in lines 8 and 15). Giving thanks is both
material and verbal: the supplicant will bring a sacrifice for Ishum and a sheep
for Ninmug, but he will also “proclaim the praises” (dalīlī dalālu) of both deities.
The latter phrase is something one sees quite often in various Akkadian prayers.

Lines 1–3: The first three lines of the text show a typical epistolary opening formula.
Ana, “to.” Bēltum, “lady,” which in this case is a goddess. d NIN . MUG = Ninmug, the goddess
to whom the letter is directed. Qabûm, “to say, to speak.” Umma is a particle that introduc-
es direct speech. One may translate it “thus says” or “PN says as follows.” The one speak-
ing is identified after the particle. Ninurta-qarrad is the proper name of the supplicant.
Wardum, “servant.”

Lines 4–7: Qabâki is an infinitive with a 2fs pronominal suffix; it is the object of the
verb at the end of line 4. Ishum is the husband of Ninmug and the god with whom she is
requested to intercede. Šemûm, “to hear, to listen to.” Line 4 provides the pre-existing basis
for the petition in lines 5–7. Annītum, “this.” Ḫiṭītum, “shortfall, loss, sin.” Ša introduces a
subordinate clause that modifies ḫiṭītim. Wabālum often means “to carry, to bring” (see line𒁹𒁹𒁹 A N OB L ETTER -P RAYER TO N INMUG

12); but in this context it means “to commit” a sin (see CAD A/1, 18). Qātum, “hand.” Itti,
“with.” Leqûm, “to take.” Qatam leqûm is an idiom meaning “to stand surety for someone,”
which in this context suggests intercession. The beneficiary of the action is indicated by
the pronominal suffix on the noun. The ubiquitous presentation scene on cylinder seals
provides visual confirmation of this description of intercession. In these scenes, a lamassu
leads a human by the hand into the presence of a seated deity or king.
qabâki Išum išemmi ana annītim ḫiṭītim ša ublam qatātīya itti Išum liqea
Lines 8–14: Inūma, “when,” introduces a temporal clause that extends to the end of
line 9. This clause sets up the prior condition for the main clause in lines 10–14. Telteqe is
the G perf. of leqûm. The preposition ina can be translated many ways; here it means
“with.” Pānīn, “face,” is in the oblique dual case. Namrum, “bright, radiant.” “A bright
face” is usually understood to refer to a person’s emotional disposition. Without detracting
from this interpretation, one may also consider the possibility that this imagery derived
from the fact that a person would normally anoint themselves with oil as part of their
daily hygienic practices. A person in mourning or doing penance would not carry out this
daily routine; rather, they would display their sorrow or contrition via their unkempt ap-
pearance. Notice the adj. is not nawrum as one might expect in an OB context. Nīqium,
“sacrifice, offering.” U, “and.” Kâšim, “to, for you.” UDU . NÍTA = immerum, “sheep.”
inūma qatātīya talteqe ina pānīn namrūtim ana Išum nīqiam ubbalam u ana kâšim
immeram ubbalam
Lines 15–19: Lines 15–17 contain a temporal clause that introduces the time frame
(rather than prior condition) of the main clause in lines 18–19. Dalīlū, “praises.” Ana
maḫar, “in front of, in the presence of.” Dalālum, “to praise.” Adallalu bears the subjunctive
–u because the verb ends the subordinate clause that began with line 15. Dalīlī dalālum is a
cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same
root. One should translate this idiomatically, “to proclaim praises” or the like. The final
verb is a 1cs precative and is ubiquitous in Akkadian prayers of all periods.
inūma dalīlī ana maḫar Išum adallalu u dalīlīki ludlul
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The idea of presenting a petitionary letter to a deity follows logically from
the dominant social model upon which ancient Near Eastern concepts of deity
were generally based, the royal elites of society. Letters addressed to the king108from subjects for the purpose of obtaining something (sometimes of only person-
al importance) are commonplace in the ancient record. It therefore seems quite
reasonable to apply the same idea to deities. If one wants something, one writes
to the deity and sends it to their house (a temple) for their perusal.
Although we do not find letter-prayers in the Hebrew Bible, 1 we do have a
case in 2 Kgs 19:14–19, where a king, Hezekiah, takes a letter that he himself
received from a foreign king, Sennacherib, to the temple of the Israelite god,
Yahweh, in order to petition the god to assistant him against the threats of the
foreign king. It is significant that this text mentions the fact that Hezekiah
spread the letter out in front of Yahweh (v. 14; ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫הוּ‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫ק‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ח‬ ִ ‫הוּ‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫פ‬ ְ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫)ו‬. 2 Whatev-
er “before Yahweh” may have meant precisely to the biblical author (or in his-
torical Judah at the end of the eighth century BCE ), Hezekiah intends for Yahweh
to see and hear the letter along with his own prayer, as his petitions in v. 16
make clear, so that Yahweh will act accordingly. Although the presentation of
this human letter to the Israelite god is not a precise parallel to our Mesopota-
mian letter-prayer, the idea of placing a letter in front of the Israelite god bears
a striking resemblance to the mentality that gave rise to the letter-prayer in an-
cient Mesopotamia

Building on the suggestions of earlier scholars, William Hallo has cautiously connected Hezeki-
ah’s ‫ב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫מ‬,
“letter,” mentioned in Isa 38:9 to the Sumerian letter-prayer tradition. See William W.
Hallo, “The Royal Correspondence of Larsa: I. A Sumerian Prototype for the Prayer of Hezeki-
ah?” in Kramer Anniversary Volume: Cuneiform Studies in Honor of Samuel Noah Kramer (ed. B. L.
Eichler; AOAT 25; Kevelaer: Butzon & Bercker / Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1976), 209–
24; repr. in William W. Hallo, The World’s Oldest Literature: Studies in Sumerian Belles-Lettres (Cul-
ture and History of the Ancient Near East 35; Boston/Leiden: Brill, 2010), 333–51. But Hallo
recognizes that ‫ב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ should probably be read here as ‫ם‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫מ‬,
“inscription,” a word found among
the superscriptions in the Psalter (see Pss 16 and 57–60), and that the content of its text, given
in vv. 10–20, is not a letter at all.
2
Is it significant that the BH verb used here to describe Hezekiah’s placement of the letter is
used elsewhere to describe a ritual gesture of the hands in prayer? See, e.g., 2 Kgs 8:22, HALOT,
976, and page 239 in this volume.

An OB Royal Hymn to Ishtar
A LAN L ENZI
I SHTAR :
See page 169.
T HE H YMN :
This OB hymn to Ishtar comprises fourteen quatrains, each separated from
the next by an inscribed line on the tablet. 1 The first ten praise Ishtar (lines 1–
40). The remaining four (lines 41–56) turn attention to the king the hymn was
to benefit: Ammiditana (1683–1647 BCE ), the great-grandson of Hammurabi. A
three line refrain (lines 57–59) and a rubric (line 60) complete the text.
The first ten stanzas fall into two equal parts, marked formally by a recur-
ring pattern: the first two stanzas of each half (i, ii, vi, and vii) utilize the so-
called Sumerian hymnic style; the other three do not (iii–v and viii–x). As one
will see, the Sumerian hymnic style in a quatrain consists of two nearly identical
couplets. The first couplet describes the deity, identifying her with only a gener-
ic term (e.g., iltam); the second couplet repeats the first verbatim but replaces
the generic term with the deity’s proper name (see also the hymn to Marduk in
Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 1–4, page 485 in this volume). Thematically-speaking, each
half of the first ten stanzas focuses on different aspects of the goddess. Stanzas i–
v center on the description of her person, lauding her greatness, her sexuality,
her loveliness, her intelligence, and her personality. Stanzas vi–x center on the
description of her position among the gods, celebrating her greatness (compare
stanza i), her word/authority, her title and rank, her equality to Anu, and her
court. Considered as a whole, the ten stanzas present a full picture of the god-
dess, personally and professionally.
The final four stanzas of the text deal with Ishtar’s beneficence to Am-
miditana. The first stanza depicts the king’s piety, showing him worthy of the
heavenly queen’s favor. 2 The second and third stanzas describe Ishtar’s interces-
1
Eight stanzas appear on the obverse and six on the reverse of the only tablet attesting the text.
Note how stanza xi introduces Ammiditana: first generically in line 41 and then by name in
line 43—a partial imitation of the Sumerian hymnic style used for Ishtar. It is also worthy of
2
111112sion on his behalf with Anu and her gift of long life to him as well as universal
dominion—both common desires of Mesopotamian kings (see, e.g., Nebuchad-
nezzar’s royal prayer on page 475). The last stanza reflexively describes the
hymn itself and how the king’s recitation of it will elicit a blessing from Ea, god
of wisdom (see page 227).
The final three lines of the text form what line 60 calls “its antiphonal,”
perhaps the refrain that would be used in antiphonal recitations of the hymn.
These three lines, like the preceding stanzas, are separated by an inscribed line
on the tablet.
note that Ishtar is called the queen in line 29 while Ammiditana is introduced as the king (line
41).

Line 1: Iltum (pl. ilātum), “goddess.” Zamārum, “to sing of.” The form is a cp impv.
Rašbum (m), rašubtum, rašbatum (f), “awe-inspiring, terrifying.” The last two words are
bound and imply a superlative statement.

Line 2: Littaʾʾid is a 3cs precative from the Dt stem of nâdum, “to be praised.” Bēltum,
“lady.” Nišū (pl), “people.” Rabītum (f), rabûm (m), “great.” Igigû is a general name for the
gods of heaven, in contrast to Anunnakkū, who are the gods of the netherworld (see Black
and Green, 106; Enūma eliš VI 69 gives the Igigû as three hundred in number and the
Anunnakkū six hundred; contradicting this, VI 39–44 number both groups as three hun-
dred).

Line 3: Adopting the typical Sumerian hymnic style, the opening couplet is repeated
nearly verbatim in lines 3–4. The second stanza (lines 5–8) shows the same literary arti-
fice. The major difference between this line and line 1, of course, is that the deity’s name
( IŠ 8 . DAR = Ištar) replaces the more general word for goddess (iltam).
Ištar zumrā rašubti ilātim
Line 4: Iššum, “woman.” The second line of the couplet is repeated nearly verbatim
but replaces nišī, “people,” with the similar sounding word iššī, “women.”
littaʾʾid bēlit iššī rabīt Igigî
Line 5: Šāt (fs), “she of, that of, which.” Mēleṣum, “excitement, exhilaration, joy.”
Ruʾāmum, “love, sexual charm.” The accusative is adverbial, describing how the goddess
clothes herself. Labāšum, “to clothe oneself, to put on.” Labšat is a 3fs predicative.
šāt mēleṣim ruʾāmam labšat
Line 6: Zaʾānum, “to be adorned.” The G predicative is only used of gods and means
“to be decorated with” (see CDA, 442). Inbum, “fruit, sexual allure.” Mikûm, “seductive
charm.” (The CAD normalizes the word as mēqû and renders it “cosmetics,” see I/J, 20.
Such a rendering is unlikely.) U, “and.” Kuzbum, “attractiveness, sexual appeal.”
zaʾnat inbī mikiam u kuzbam
Line 7: The previous couplet’s first line is repeated, substituting the goddess’s name.
Ištar mēleṣim ruʾāmam labšat
Line 8: Kuzbum is also used to describe both Shamḫat and Gilgamesh in the Epic of
Gilgamesh (see, e.g., I 181, 189 and I 237).
zaʾnat inbī mikiam u kuzbam
Line 9: Šaptān, “lips” (d). Šaptīn is in the oblique case (gen.–acc.) and functions as an
adverbial accusative. Duššupum, “sweetened, very sweet,” is a denominative (D stem) from
dišpum, “honey.” One may wish to use some form of honey in the translation: “honeyed” or
“dripping with honey.” The adj. is used as a 3fs predicative here. Balāṭum, “life, health,
vigor.” Pûm, “mouth.” The line suggests both the allure of the goddess (in that kissing her
would be sweet) as well as her powers to sustain life (in that carbohydrate-loaded honey11410. si-im-ti-iš-ša i-ḫa-an-ni-i-ma ṣi-ḫa-tum

would revive one’s strength). In light of lines 6 and 8, “lips” and “mouth” in this line are
likely to be understood as double entendres.
šaptīn duššupat balāṭum pīša
Line 10: Simtum has a wide semantic range, including “person or thing that is fitting,
suitable, seemly, appropriate, necessary,” “person or thing that befits, does honor to, is the
pride of,” “appurtenances, ornament, characteristic, insigne, proper appearance or behav-
ior or ways, figural representation,” and “face, features” (see CAD S, 278). The latter
meaning is most appropriate here (see CAD S, 283). The form simtišša includes the termi-
native-adverbial ending –iš before the 3fs pronominal suffix, –ša (note also that the result-
ing –šš– does not change to –ss–). The adverbial ending in this construction has a locative
meaning (“in” or “on”). Ṣīḫtum, “smile” (pl. ṣīḫātum). Ḫanāmum, “to thrive, to be luxuriant,
to flourish” (see CDA, 105; AHw, 320). The older CAD Ḫ volume suggests “to bloom” (76),
but this meaning cannot account for the verb’s use with sheep, noted in CDA and AHw.
simtišša iḫannimā ṣīḫātum
Line 11: Šarḫum, “proud, magnificent, splendid” (used as a 3fs predicative). On the
basis of the context, it is likely that the adjective describes Ishtar’s appearance rather than
her internal attitude. I-ri-mu is difficult. The text may be read as irimmu (so CAD I/J, 177
and CDA, 131) and translated “beaded necklace” or the like. Joan and Aage Westenholz
(“Help for Rejected Suitors: The Old Akkadian Love Incantation MAD V 8,” Or n.s. 46
[1977], 198–219, specifically, 205–7) argue that the word “īrimum (or irīmum ?) denotes a
quality, apparently mostly of females, which makes its possessor irresistibly attractive to
the opposite sex” (206). They suggest the word has an abstract meaning in its plural form:
“loveliness, love.” (The singular, they suggest, may be used to designate a personification
of the attribute in the form of a mythological being like the Greek Eros or Roman Cupid
[see 205 and 207]. For further support for the Babylonian Cupid from a new OB love po-
em, see A. R. George, Babylonian Literary Texts in the Schøyen Collection [Cornell University
Studies in Assyriology and Sumerology 10; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2009], 53.) Following the
Westenholzes, Foster translates the word as “love-charms,” but he also recognizes the pos-
sibility that these may take the form of “a necklace or headband” (85, n.1). Ramûm, “to set
in place, to be endowed with.” The form is a 3mp predicative. Rēšum, “head.” The loca-
tive-adverbial ending –um and a 3fs pronominal suffix are attached to the noun, describing
where the beads have been placed. The m of the locative-adverbial ending assimilates to
the š of the pronominal suffix (–mš– becomes –šš–). Notice the consonance in the final
three words of the line.
šarḫat īrimū ramû rēšušša
Line 12: Banûm, “good, beautiful.” Šimtum, “mark, token,” may refer to skin tone; as
it is dual, perhaps it refers to rosy cheeks (CDA, 373). Bitrāmum, “multi-colored.” Īnū,
“eyes.” Šitʾārum, “variegated, iridescent.” The adjectives in this line are 3fp predicatives.

16. ba-aš-tum ma-aš-ra-ḫu la-ma-as-su-um še-e-du-um
Line 13: Eltum is probably a by-form of iltum, “goddess,” but has also been understood
to mean “pure one” (see Hecker, 722, n.13a). This opening word is an anacoluthon that
establishes the topic of the line, the goddess. Išti, “with.” We expect the suffixed form to be
ištīša but ištaša is attested elsewhere in OB Akkadian (see CAD I/J, 283). The preposition
almost always occurs with a suffix; the one known exception is in our line 45. One could
argue that the preposition is to be understood as ištu, “from, out of,” but the context sug-
gests the line should be about characterizing the goddess herself—what she possesses—
rather than what comes from her. Bašûm, “to be, to exist.” Milkum, “counsel, advice, intel-
ligence,” is the grammatical subject of the sentence.
eltum ištaša ibašši milkum
Line 14: Šīmtum, “what is fixed, fate, destiny.” Šīmāt is a fp construct form.
Mimmāmu/a/i, “everything, all.” Qātum, “hand.” Here again we see the terminative-
adverbial ending followed by a pronominal suffix indicating location. Tamāḫum, “to
grasp.” The form looks like a 3fs predicative, but it is a transitive parsāku (thus the object).
šīmāt mimmāmi qātišša tamḫat
Line 15: Naplāsum, “glance, look” (a noun), bears the locative-adverbial ending (–um)
and a 3fs pronominal suffix. The m of the locative assimilates to the š of the suffix. Bani
may derive from banûm, “to be good” (see CAD B, 91, though translating it with “is creat-
ed (?),” AHw, 102, 135, and Seux, 40; see also the cognate in line 12). But von Soden’s
earlier translation in this line, “ist . . . geschaffen,” “is . . . created,” suggests a derivation
from banûm, “to build, to engender, to create” (likewise Foster’s “is born” [86]). Buʾārum,
“health, prosperity, happiness.” Notice the lack of mimation on the final substantive.
naplāsušša bani buʾāru
Line 16: The list of things engendered by Ishtar’s glance continues. Bāštum (baštum),
“dignity, good looks, pride,” sometimes occurs in contexts with lamassum and šēdum (see
CAD B, 142). Mašraḫū, “good health (?)” (always pl.); CAD M, 385 suggests “splendor,
attractiveness.” The word only occurs twice in extant texts, both times in OB hymns. La-
massum and šēdum were protective spirits that guarded individuals, temples, and cities. See
further Daniel Foxvog, Anne Draffkorn Kilmer, and Wolfgang Heimpel, “Lamma/Lamassu.
A.I. Mesopotamien. Philogisch,” RlA 6 (1980–1983), 446–53. For individuals, they are
closely associated with the personal god and goddess (see, e.g., Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, I 43–46).

21. a-ia-um na-ar-bi-à-aš i-ša-an-na-an ma-an-nu-um
Line 17: Several obscure words make this line difficult. The first word may be tartāmū
(pl), “mutual love” (CAD T, 245), “love-making” (CDA, 400), “whispers” (see Foster, 86,
citing W. von Soden, review of Marie-Joseph Seux, Hymnes et prières aux dieux de Babylonie
et d’Assyrie. Introduction, traduction et notes, ZA 67 [1977], 279 but see also AHw, 1332).
But it may also be a 3fs form of ramû, tartāmi (see CAD T, 245 and 374, Seux, 40, and von
Soden, 235). There are several verbal forms with a ta– affix in the next several lines that
must be understood as 3fs. Tešmûm, “attention, listening, compliance.” Ritūmum, “in-
tense(?) love, passion” (CAD R, 391), “love-making” (CDA, 306). Ṭūbum, “goodness, hap-
piness, prosperity, good will, peace, contentedness, satisfaction.”
tartāmi tešmê ritūmī ṭūbī
Line 18: Mitgurum is a Gt infinitive used as a substantive, meaning “agreement, gra-
ciousness.” Bêlum, “to rule over, to control, to dispose of.” Given the context of describing
the goddess’s attributes, the verb should be understood as a durative. Šī, “she.” The pres-
ence of the independent pronoun indicates emphasis.
u mitguram tebêl šī-ma
Line 19: Ardatum, “young woman.” The noun is bound to the following verb, which
comprises a short subordinate clause that describes the young woman. Ta-at-ta-ab is prob-
lematic since we expect a subjunctive on the verb. Thureau-Dangin takes ta-at-ta-ab for the
verb tattabû, a 3fs (see also the final verb in the line) perfect from nabûm, “to call, to
name” (see 175, n.9). Others (e.g., von Soden, 236 [implied by translation]) have opted to
read the signs as ta-at-ta-du ! , presumably understanding the form as an N 3fs perfect
(tattaddû) from nadûm, “to throw down,” here “to abandon.” See Seux, 40, n.9 for a brief
discussion and his preference for the former verb. Neither option is without problems.
Ummum, “mother.” Notice the loss of mimation. Rašûm, “to acquire, to obtain.” Tarašši is a
3fs durative.
ardat tattabû/tattaddû umma tarašši
Line 20: Zakārum, “to say, to speak, to invoke.” I-ni-ši may be a sandhi writing for ina
iššī, “among the women” (iniššī) or “ina nišī, “among the people” (innišī). See lines 2 and 4,
Seux, 40, n.10, and Foster, 88 at the note for line 20. For nabûm, see the note on line 19.
Šumum, “name.” Invoking or calling on the name of a deity was a means of honoring them.
izakkarši iniššī/innišī inabbi šumša
Line 21: Ayyum (see CAD ajû), “who?, which?” Narbium, “greatness.” The š on the
noun is an apocopated 3fs pronominal suffix (narbiam + ša > narbiašša > narbiaš). The
initial sound of the following verb may have contributed to the loss of the suffix’s a.𒐼 A N OB R OYAL H YMN TO I SHTAR

Šanānum, “to rival, to equal.” Mannum, “who?” The line contains two question words, thus
two questions.

Line 22: Gašrum, “powerful, mighty.” Ṣīrum, “exalted, supreme, splendid.” Šūpûm,
“manifest, resplendent, brillliant.” All of the adjs. are mp predicatives. Parṣū, “cultic ordi-
nances, rites.”
gašrū ṣīrū šūpû parṣūša
Line 23: The poem returns to the Sumerian hymnic style used in the opening two
stanzas of the hymn. Ishtar’s name here, however, does not replace a pronoun in line 21
that refers to her. Rather, the initial interrogative pronoun there (ayyum) is removed and
the inserted divine name here in line 23 functions as an anacoluthon, similar to the use of
eltum at the opening of line 13.
Ištar narbiaš išannan mannum
Line 24: This line repeats line 22 verbatim.
gašrū ṣīrū šūpû parṣūša
Line 25: The initial signs on the tablet are bi-a-at; the present reading comes from von
Soden (see Foster, 86 at the note on line 25 and Seux, 40, n.11). Šāt, see line 5. Again, the
presence of the independent pronoun here is emphatic (and redundant with the pronomi-
nal suffix on nazzāzuš). Atārum, “to exceed in number or size, to surpass in importance,
quality.” The form atar is 3ms predicative. I-ni-li is probably a sandhi writing for ina ilī,
“among the gods” (see similarly line 20). Nanzāzum (nanzazum, nazzāzum), “attendant,
courtier; position, station.” The latter meaning is most appropriate here.
šāt inilī atar nazzāzuš
Line 26: Kabātum, “to be(come) heavy, important, respected.” Amātum, “word, mat-
ter.” Notice we have the later form of the word rather than awātum; the former does occa-
sionally occur in OB Akkadian contexts. The addition of the 3fs pronominal suffix, –ša,
directly to the base of the noun, amāt–, results in the sound change: –tš– becomes –ss–. El,
“on, above, beyond,” is a by-form of the more common preposition eli. It is unclear wheth-
er the pronominal suffix attached to the preposition refers to the gods’ words (“over
them,” i.e., their words) or to the gods themselves (“over them,” i.e., the gods). Regarding
ḫa-AB-ta-at-ma, the middle radical of the root from which the final verb derives is disput-
ed; thus, the AB sign is in Roman capital letters. CAD Ḫ derives the verb from ḫabātum118

(11); CDA (106) and AHw (321) take it from ḫapātum. Whatever one’s decision on this, all
three lexica agree that the verb means “to prevail, to triumph.”
kabtat amāssa elšunu ḫabtat-ma
Line 27: Once again the previous couplet is repeated with the predictable substitution
of the deity’s name in the first line.
Ištar inilī atar nazzāzuš
Line 28: The goddess’s position and the effectiveness of her word are inextricably
linked.
kabtat amāssa elšunu ḫabtat-ma
Line 29: Šarratum, “queen.” The form šarrassun is a 3fs predicative with a shortened
3mp pronominal suffix, –šun(u), attached to it. Šutadunnum (Št lex. of nadānum), “to delib-
erate, to discuss something (with others).” The form is a 3mp durative. Siqrum is a by-form
of zikrum, “utterance, speech, command.” See GAG §30c for the occurrence of s for an
expected z.
šarrassun uštanaddanū siqrīša
Line 30: Kullatum, “all of, totality.” Šâš is an OB poetic form of the dative pronoun
šâšim, “to her.” Kamāsum, “to kneel, to crouch.” The 3fs dative suffix (without the final m)
on the predicative is redundant with šâš earlier in the line.
kullassun šâš kamsūši
Line 31: Nannārum (nannarum), “luminary, light of the sky, moon.” This is a common
epithet of the moon god Sin and occasionally for Ishtar. Thureau-Dangin reads the final
verb as i-la-qú-ši-im, deriving it from leqûm, “to receive.” Others have suggested the present
reading, which derives the verb from alākum, “to go.” See Foster, 88 at the note for line 31
for references.
nannārīša illakūšim
Line 32: Iššū, “women.” Awīlum, “man, human being.” In light of the first plural noun,
the singular one that follows is probably either a mistake or functioning as a collective.
Palāḫum, “to fear.” Given the fact that there is an object on the verb, we should under-
stand the form as a transitive parsāku construction.

Line 33: Puḫrum, “assembly.” The noun also bears the terminative-adverbial ending
(–iš) and a shortened 3mp pronominal suffix. This assembly is the divine council. The sub-
stantive etellum can have a nominal sense, “lord, prince,” as well as an adjectival one, “pre-
eminent,” as here. Šūturum, “supreme, surpassing.” Both adjectives in the line are predica-
tives. Ishtar’s word is authoritative, which is partly due to her position (line 34) but also a
product of her insight (see line 35).
puḫriššun etel qabûša šūtur
Line 34: Ana, “to, for.” An-nim is for Anim, the genitive of Anum. Anu(m) is the Meso-
potamian sky god (see page 217). Šarrum, “king.” Malâm, “as an equal,” only occurs here
and in the Agushaya Poem. (W)ašābum, “to sit, to dwell.” The form of the verb is a 3fs
predicative. The accusative pronominal suffix is not a direct object; rather, it is an adver-
bial accusative describing the goddess’s sitting. She sits “with them” or “among them,” i.e.,
with/among the other gods.
ana Anim šarrīšunu malâm ašbassunu
Line 35: Uznum, literally “ear” but also “understanding.” Nēmequm, “knowledge, wis-
dom, experience.” We expect an accusative rather than a genitive case ending. Ḫasīsum,
“ear, hearing, wisdom, comprehension.” All three words modify eršet adverbially. Eršu,
“wise,” is used as a 3fs predicative. Line 33 asserted the authority of Ishtar’s word. Here
we see a reason for that authority: she speaks with wisdom.
uznam nēmeqim ḫasīsam eršet
Line 36: Mitlukum (Gt of malākum), “to confer (about something), to discuss (with
others).” Ḫammum, “master, head of household, head of family.” Ishtar’s ḫammum is cer-
tainly Anu. The line states the conclusion for which the previous lines of the stanza have
prepared.
imtallikū šī u ḫammuš
Line 37: Ramûm is the same word as in line 11, but here it means “to take up resi-
dence, to occupy.” For other occurrences with parakkum, see CAD R, 134. Ištīniš (ištēniš),
“together.” Parakkum, “cult, dais, sanctuary.” Again we see Ishtar described as equal in
rank to Anu.

Line 38: Iggegunnîm is the result of ina plus gegu(n)nûm (gigunû), “raised temple.”
Gegunnûm is some kind of “sacred building erected on terraces” (CAD G, 67). The word
sometimes occurs in apposition to ziqqurratum, “ziggurrat, temple step-tower,” and may
refer “to the sanctuary on top of the temple tower” (CAD G, 70). Šubtum, “dwelling, seat.”
Rīštum, “joy, exultation, jubilation.” Rīšātim is a plural.
iggegunnîm šubat rīšātim
Line 39: Muttiš, “in front of, before.” Ilu, “god, deity.” Nazuzzū is a 3mp predicative
from nazzazum (N of i/uzuzzu; see GAG §107e), “to appear, to become present.” The i in
the third sign of the verb’s orthography is superfluous. This line provides another aspect of
Ishtar’s authority: the gods appear before her (and Anu) as servants.
muttiššun ilū nazuzzū
Line 40: Ipšum means “deed, action.” But bound to pûm, “mouth,” ipiš pî means
“speech, command” (see CAD I/J, 170). The form of the word here, ipšiš, is to be explained
as ipšu plus the terminative-adverbial ending, which has replaced the preposition ana.
Bašûm means “to be, to be available” but with ears and eyes, “to be fixed on, to be atten-
tive.” Uznāšun is the nom. dual of uznum with an apocopated 3mp pronominal suffix. The
servile status of the other gods, intimated in the previous line, is confirmed and described
here.
ipšiš pīšunu bašiā uznāšun
Line 41: This line subtly introduces Ammiditana (see line 43), the OB king who is
lauded here as the beneficiary of Ishtar’s largess. Migrum can mean “consent, approval,
agreement” but also “favored one, favorite” (see CAD M/2, 48), as is appropriate here.
Narāmum, “beloved.” Libbum, “heart.” This line only introduces the subject of the sentence,
which is completed in the next line.
šarrum migrašun narām libbīšun
Line 42: Šarḫiš, “proudly, splendidly, in a lavish manner.” Itaqqû, (Gtn of naqû), “to
offer a libation, sacrifice repeatedly.” The form of the verb is durative, though one might
expect ittanaqqi. The present form may be explained by the fact that the Gtn stem of I-n
and I-w verbs sometimes elide the –ta– (see GAG §91d and §102k). The pronominal suffix
is a 3mp accusative, though a dative, –šunūšim, is expected. As is often the case in this text,
the final short vowel has dropped off. Nīqum, “offering, sacrifice.” Ellum, “pure, holy.”

Line 43: Ammiditana (1683–1647 BCE ) is the name of Hammurabi’s great-grandson.
Nīqi is bound to the following noun, qātum, “hand,” and functions as an accusative, modi-
fied by ellam. Ellam nīqi qātīšu is parallel with and grammatically in apposition to lî u yalī
namrāʾī in line 44. Note Foster’s conflated translation: “His personal, pure libation of cattle
and fatted stags” (87). Both phrases are the direct object of the verb in line 44.
Ammiditana ellam nīqi qātīšu
Line 44: Maḫrum as a preposition means “before, in front of, in the presence of.”
Šubbûm (D of šebûm), “to fill with, to satisfy with (= acc.).” Lûm (līʾum), “bull.” Yalum
(ayyalum, ajalu), “stag, deer.” Namrāʾū, “fattened” (pl).
maḫrīšun ušebbi lî u yalī namrāʾī
Line 45: Išti here means “from.” Ḫāmirum (ḫāwirum), “husband.” Erēšum, “to request,
to demand” from (= išti). The form of the verb is perfect (tētereš), as is the case through-
out this stanza, with both a ventive (–am) and a 3ms dative (–šum) suffix on the end. The
object of the verb is contained in the following line. Other traditions make Ishtar the
daughter rather than the spouse of Anu.
išti Anim ḫāmerīša tēteršaššum
Line 46: Dārium, “lasting, perpetual, eternal.” Arkum, “long.”
dāriam balāṭam arkam
Line 47: Mādum, “many, numerous.” Šattum, “year.” Ana Ammiditana makes explicit
the referent of the dative pronominal suffix on the verb in the previous couplet (see line
45).
mādātim šanāt balāṭim ana Ammiditana
Line 48: Šutlumum, “to grant, to bestow generously,” only occurs in the Š stem. Tušat-
lim is a 3fs preterite. Nadānum, “to give.” Tattadin is a 3fs perfect.
tušatlim Ištar tattadin
Line 49: Siqrum, see line 29, bears the locative-adverbial ending, –um, substituting
here for ina, plus a 3fs pronominal suffix. Šuknušum (Š of kanāšum), “to make someone12250. ki-ib-ra-at er-bé-e-em a-na še-pí-i-šu

bow down, submit.” The 3fs verb ends with both a ventive and a 3ms dative pronominal
suffix. The verb’s object occurs in the following line.
siqrušša tušaknišaššum
Line 50: Kibrum, “edge, bank, shore, rim.” The plural form of the word bound to the
word erbûm, “four,” means “the whole world, all the lands” (kibrāt erbêm). Šēpum, “foot.”
kibrāt erbêm ana šēpīšu
Line 51: Napḫarum, “total, all, the whole.” Kalûm, “all, totality. Dadmū, “inhabited
world, villages, settlements.”
u napḫar kalīšunu dadmī
Line 52: Ṣamādum, “to yoke, to tie up.” The form is a 3fs perfect with a 3mp accusa-
tive pronominal suffix, which is redundant with the object expressed already in the previ-
ous line. The t of the perfect infix assimilates to the sibilant first root letter (–ṣt– become
–ṣṣ–). Also, the –dš– cluster at the boundary of the verb and suffix becomes –ss–. Nīru,
“yoke.” Ana + nīru + 3ms pronominal suffix –šu results in anīrīšu. With regard to the last
two signs in the line, see lines 39 and 54 for a similar orthography.
taṣṣamissunūti anīrīšu
Line 53: Biblum means “the (action of) bringing, things brought.” But the phrase bibil
(bibel) libbim means “heart’s desire.” Zamārum, “song.” Lalûm, “exuberance, desire, (sexual)
charms.” CAD L, 50 translates zamār lalêša as “her favorite song.”
bibel libbīša zamār lalêša
Line 54: Naṭûm, “suitable, fitting.” The word describes the phrases in the previous
line. The “his” of ana pīšu is probably king Ammiditana. Ea is the god of wisdom, magic,
and water (see page 227). Epēšum, “to do, to make,” but with an object in the semantic
domain of speech or speaking (here, siqrum), “to speak.” Īpussi is the 3cs preterite plus a
3fs dative pronominal suffix (–šim). The subject is the king.
naṭûm-ma ana pīšu siqri Ea īpussi
Line 55: Šemûm, “to hear.” The verb is 3cs; Ea is the subject. Tanittum, “praise.”
Riāšum, “to rejoice, to exult in, to exult over.” Irīš is a 3cs preterite with a 3ms pronominal
suffix. The verbal action is sequential.

Line 56: This line seems to provide the content of Ea’s exultation. Balāṭum, “to live, to
be healthy.” The form is a 3cs precative (as is the other verb in the line). The king is the
beneficiary of the well-wishing, that is, he is the grammatical subject. Šarrašu, “his king,”
the subject of the second precative, refers to the king’s king, perhaps the city god. But it is
unclear. See Thureau-Dangin, 177, n.3 (also Foster, 87, n.2). Râmum, “to love.” Addāriš is
ana plus dāriš, “forever.”
libluṭ-ma šarrašu lirāmšu addāriš
Line 57: Lines 57–59 are the antiphonal refrain. Rāʾimīki is a G ms participle from
râmum (see line 56) with a 2fs pronominal suffix. The participle modifies šarri. Note, also,
the loss of mimation in šarri. Just as Ea requested that his king love Ammiditana (line 56),
he characterizes Ammiditana as one who loves the goddess.
Ištar ana Ammiditana šarri rāʾimīki
Line 58: For arkam dāriam balāṭam, the object of the (fs) imperative, see line 46.
Šarākum, “to grant, to bestow.” The line repeats sentiments expressed already in lines 46
and 47.
arkam dāriam balāṭam šurkī
Line 59: See line 56 for the verb. Wishing the king long life was not only a means to
show loyalty to the king, it might also be in the best interest of the wisher. The transition
from one king to another could be marred by civil unrest and/or military action.

Line 60: This line is composed in Sumerian, which translates into Akkadian as
miḫiršu. It means “its antiphonal.” The term is found in several OB hymnic compositions.
See CAD M/2, 57 (miḫru).
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Although there are several hymns in the Hebrew Bible to Yahweh (e.g., Pss
8, 29, Nah 1:2–8, etc.), 1 there are no hymns to goddesses. Perhaps the closest
candidate of such is the self-description of the female personified Wisdom in
1
See Hermann Gunkel and Joachim Begrich, Introduction to the Psalms: The Genres of the Reli-
gious Lyrics of Israel (trans. James D. Nogalski; Macon: Mercer University Press, 1998), 22–23 for
a rather full listing of hymns and “hymn-like elements” in the Hebrew Bible.124Prov 8:4–36. 2 But only a small minority of scholars believes Wisdom has the
attributes here of a full-fledged, independent goddess. 3 The so very obvious ab-
sence of licit (or sanctioned) goddess worship in the Hebrew Bible is one of the
Bible’s most distinctive features as compared to other ancient Near Eastern reli-
gious texts. 4
On a smaller scale, several phrases in our hymn merit comparative atten-
tion. In line 9 Ishtar is enticingly described as having lips dripping with honey.
The same sensual idea is found in Song 4:11, where the female lover is described
as follows: ‫ְך‬ ֵ‫שׁוֹנ‬ ְ‫ל‬ ‫ת‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ‫שׁ‬ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫דּ‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ‫לּ‬ ָ ‫כּ‬ ַ ‫ך‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫תוֹת‬
‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׂ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ְ ‫טּ‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֶ ‫נ‬ , “your lips drip pure honey,
honey and milk (lie) under your tongue.” 5 It seems rather clear that in both cas-
es honey functions as a sensual metaphor for the desirability of kissing feminine
lips. 6 Yet the juxtaposition of the phrase in line 9a of our hymn with the state-
ment in line 9b, namely, “her mouth (is) vivacity” (balāṭum, lit. “life”), suggests
that honey is more than an ancient flavored lip gloss in the hymn. Honey is also
life-sustaining; its sweetness invigorates. The same idea is expressed literally in 1
Sam 14:24–30, the account of Jonathan disobeying his father’s oath by eating
some honey found in the field, and used metaphorically in Prov 24:13–14,
where the desirability of eating honey is used to impress upon young boys (note
‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫בּ‬,
“my son” in v. 13) the desirability of obtaining wisdom. For with wisdom, so
the proverb goes, ‫ת‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫לֹא‬ ‫ָך‬ ‫ת‬ ְ ָ‫ו‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ‫ת‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ית‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ח‬ ֲ ‫א‬ ַ ‫יֵשׁ‬ , “there is a future, and your hope will
not be cut off” (v. 14).
The incomparability of the goddess trope that we see in lines 21 and 23
compares to similar hymnic expressions used of Yahweh. 7 For example, in the
celebrated Song of the Sea Miriam exclaims ‫שׁ‬ ‫ֹד‬ ֶ ‫קּ‬ ‫בּ‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫דּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ְ ֶ‫נ‬ ‫ה‬ ‫ֹכ‬ ָ ‫מ‬ ‫כּ‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ‫ֹכ‬ ָ ‫מ‬ ‫כ‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ִ
‫א‬ ֶ‫ל‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ‫ה‬ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ‫ֹּלת‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ‫נוֹר‬,
“Who is like you, O Yahweh, among the gods? Who is like
you, glorious in holiness? 8 Awesome in splendor, working wonders!” David and
Solomon, both kings like Ammiditana, laud Yahweh similarly with statements in
2 Sam 7:22 ( 1 Chron 17:20): ‫ָך‬ ‫ת‬ ֶ ‫זוּל‬
‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ין‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ְ‫ו‬ ‫מוָֹך‬ ‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ין‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ָ‫ֹנ‬ ‫ד‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫גּ‬, ָ “you are

Compare the first person self-praise here with the same in the Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi (see
W. G. Lambert, “The Gula Hymn of Bulluṭsa-rabi,” Or n.s. 36 [1967], 105–32, with plates VII–
XXIII for the most recent edition of the text). See also n.234 on page 59 of the general introduc-
tion for other references to the self-praise of deities.

It should be noted that the most common word for honey in BH, ‫שׁ‬ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫דּ‬, ְ is cognate to Akk. dišpu,
despite the metathesis of the final two consonants. See Tawil, ALCBH, 72.
6
Honey, of course, is not limited to sensual metaphors. The sweetness of honey is used in Ezek
3:3 to describe the literal taste of the divine scroll Ezekiel ate and in Ps 119:103 as the basis of
comparison to convey the surpassing sweetness of Yahweh’s word.

great, O lord Yahweh, for there in no one like you, and there is no god except

‫ע‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬, “O Yahweh, god of Israel, there is no one like you among the
gods in the heavens above and upon the earth below. . . .” (It is notable that
both royal hymnic statements occur in the context of petitionary prayer.) See
also, for example, Pss 35:10, 71:19, 86:8, Jer 10:6–7, and Mic 7:18. Interesting-
ly, the incomparability of Yahweh—especially as compared to Mesopotamian
gods—is a major theme in Second Isaiah, where, although humans do laud this
divine attribute (see, e.g., 40:18), it is the deity himself who proclaims it most
ardently (see, e.g., 40:25, 44:7, 45:21, and 46:5).
Lines 25–40 of our hymn describe Ishtar’s position in the divine assembly.
Since I present a brief comparative discussion of the divine assembly elsewhere
in this volume (see Sin 1 on page 398), I focus here on one particular aspect that
indicates a common representation in Israel and Mesopotamia of the hierarchy
within it. In line 39 the hymn states that the gods appear before Ishtar and Anu,
indicating thereby (and throughout the context) the pre-eminent position of the
divine couple in relation to all of the other deities under their command (see
lines 26, 28, and 40). The Akk. word translated as “appear” in line 39 is an N
stem verb with an ingressive sense, derived from i/uzuzzu, “to stand.” This
standing posture of the gods is in direct opposition to Ishtar’s being seated, de-
scribed in line 34. The very same notion of divine beings making an appearance
or presenting themselves to a divine king occurs in the Hebrew Bible at Job 1:6
and 2:1, where we read: ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ל־י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫צּ‬ ֵ ַ‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫אוּ‬ ‫בוֹ‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ , “the gods entered (the
divine court) to present themselves to Yahweh.” Notice the use of the hitpael
stem of ‫יצב‬, a by-form of ‫נצב‬, “to stand.” In fact, verbs of standing (especially
‫)עמד‬ are commonly used in BH to describe the posture of subordinates serving a
superior, sometimes depicted as seated. A number of examples of servants stand-
ing before their human master could be cited, 9 but the most relevant text for
understanding the divine assembly is 1 Kgs 22:19 ( 2 Chron 18:18), where Mi-
caiah describes Yahweh’s throne room: ‫ד‬ ‫ֹמ‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫ל־צ‬
‫כ‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ‫אוֹ‬ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ל־כּ‬
‫ע‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫ית‬ ִ ‫א‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ
‫מֹאלוֹ‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ְ ‫וּמ‬
‫ינוֹ‬ ‫ימ‬
‫מ‬ ִ ‫יו‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫ע‬,
“I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne and the entire host of
heaven was standing before him, on his right and on his left.” The court discuss-
es for a moment how to entrap Ahab in battle. And then in v. 21 ( 2 Chron
18:20) a particular servant steps out from the throng to proffer the winning idea:
‫נּוּ‬ ‫תּ‬ ֶ ‫פ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫ר‬ ‫אמ‬
‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫מֹד‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ַ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫רוּח‬
‫ה‬ ָ ‫א‬ ‫צ‬ ֵ ֵ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬, “the spirit came forward, stood before
Yahweh, and said, ‘I will deceive him.’” Isa 6:1–2 presents the very same image
of a seated Yahweh with divine servants standing in attendance. As many others
have demonstrated, 10 the divine assembly is a common mythological idea
throughout the ancient Near East based on the royal court. It is this common
human model that explains the mythological commonalities in the texts.

An Incantation-Prayer: Ghosts of My Family 1
A LAN L ENZI
G HOSTS :
Ancient Mesopotamians believed ghosts were the animating force in human
bodies that (usually) continued to exist in the grave/netherworld or elsewhere
after physical death. A proper burial, i.e., interment, was necessary for a per-
son’s ghost to take up its new and proper residence in the grave/netherworld.
Without this social dignity, they might be condemned to roam as a restless
ghost—though there were other reasons a person became a restless ghost after
death. 1 Once the deceased was laid to rest, a cyclical ritual called kispu(m) had
to be performed by a surviving relative (usually). This person was known as the
pāqidu, “the one who attends to (it).” This rite included making funerary offer-
ings of various kinds of food (kispa kasāpu), pouring out libations of water (mê
naqû), and invoking the deceased’s name as a memorial (šuma zakāru). The per-
formance of this rite was necessary to maintain the deceased’s ghost in the neth-
erworld. Without it, the ghost would have a miserable existence and could turn
malevolent against humans. This rite did not, however, have to continue indefi-
nitely. Rather, after a generation or two—after those who had known the de-
ceased were themselves dead—a ghost would become part of the collective dead
and no longer receive offerings as an individual.
Ghosts were believed to have supra-human powers, somewhat like demons.
They could act benevolently toward humans—thus the appeal in our prayer, but
we have relatively few texts that seek their assistance. 2 In some of these, the
ghosts are asked to assist the supplicant with the removal of a certain evil by
handing it over to specific denizens of the netherworld (as in our prayer). In
others, we see the practice of necromancy, divination via the dead (see Finkel).
Usually, however, ghosts were considered malevolent, bringing illness and other

See Scurlock, “Ghosts and the Afterlife,” 1890 for a list of reasons people became ghosts. Anni-
hilation seems to have been the fate of those who were burned to death (see the final lines of
Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Netherworld).

133134misfortunes upon those they afflicted. Many rituals were developed and per-
formed by exorcists (āšipus) to treat these ghost-induced maladies. 3
T HE P RAYER :
This incantation-prayer is embedded in a larger anti-witchcraft ritual that
contains several other incantation-prayers. 4 The incantation-prayers that precede
ours address various netherworld-related beings, such as the Divine River
(Nāru), the Anunnakki, Shamash, and Gilgamesh, the latter two of which func-
tion as netherworld judges (see our line 7). The incantation-prayer that follows
ours is addressed to the ghost of nobody (eṭem lā mammanama), represented by a
skull (gulgullu). 5 A very close parallel to our incantation-prayer appears in an
incantation-prayer to Ishtar and Dumuzi. 6 This illustrates how incantation-
prayers were adopted into and adapted to different ritual contexts (see Farber,
118).
The text of the prayer may be divided thematically into the three typical
parts of an incantation-prayer: the invocation (lines 1–4a), the petition (lines
4b–15, 17a), and the promise of praise (lines 16, 17b); but these parts are
grammatically integrated into one another. That is, the first element in the peti-
tion section of the prayer (line 4b) completes the sentence begun in the invoca-
tion, and the two elements comprising the promise of praise are each dependent
upon one of the last two petitions in the prayer: line 16 depends on line 15 and
line 17b upon line 17a. Given this, the prayer’s brevity, and the fact that it lacks
the various transitional phrases one often sees in, for example, the shuilla-
prayers—transitions such as the self-presentation formula or the reiterated invo-
cation, the prayer reads very quickly and smoothly. Perhaps the one feature in
the text of the prayer that creates a sense of disjunction between or transition
from one conceptual part to another is the use of first person verbal forms in
lines 4b–6, which moves the prayer from invocation to petition, 7 and the return
of these first person verbs starting in line 14, which moves the prayer from a
predominance of petition to the lines containing its promise of praise.
The invocation differs from many of the other prayers in this volume in that
it does not extensively laud the beings invoked. The ghosts are not reminded of
their attributes or cosmic position via a string of epithets at the beginning of this
prayer. Rather, the invocation simply identifies—in multiple ways—to whom the
prayer is directed: any and all family ghosts. I have suggested elsewhere that the

This incantation was treated in Scurlock’s dissertation as Prescription 87 (pp. 357–61).

For a critical edition of the text, see Farber, 150–53. Scurlock also treats the incantation as
Prescription 86 (pp. 354–57) in her dissertation.

The disjunction created by the first person verbs in lines 4b–6 is heightened by the initial 2mp
independent pronoun (attunu) and the anacoluthon that follows in the invocation.

dingirshadibba-prayers have very brief invocations because the personal god
addressed in those prayers, unlike the high gods entreated in the shuilla-prayers,
is familiar with the supplicant and already has a close personal relationship with
him. One need not heap honorifics upon a deity one already knows well; but a
god near the top of the divine hierarchy would have to be addressed with all due
respect. 8 The same reasoning for the brief invocation of the present prayer
would seem to apply here as well.
The invocation moves seamlessly into the petition section of the prayer. The
first part of this section describes the supplicant’s preparatory actions (lines 4b–
6) via a series of first person preterite verbs. Three petitions to establish the
ghosts’ presence begin the petitions proper (lines 7–8). These are followed by a
series of petitions in lines 9–15 and 17a that concern the supplicant’s affliction
and recovery.
Interlaced with the final two petitions of the prayer is the promise of praise
(lines 16, 17b). The first promise, to libate cool water down the grave pipe, is
specific to the ghostly audience of the prayer. The second is a stock phrase, ap-
parently added to our prayer mechanically (with a 2ms pronominal suffix rather
than the expected 2mp).

Line 1: One of the witnesses to the prayer, LKA 89, preserves traces of the word ÉN =
šiptu, “ritual wording, incantation,” which indicates to the user of the tablet that a prayer
or incantation follows. GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost of a dead person.” Given the 2mp pronoun
attunu, “you,” at the head of the line in apposition to the vocative eṭemmu, the latter is
certainly to be rendered as a collective, thus “ghosts.” Notice also the consonance between
attunu and eṭem (the bound form of eṭemmu). Kimtu, “family.” One might consider render-
ing eṭem kimtīya as “my ancestral family” (see Abusch, “Etemmu,” 309). Bānû, literally
“builder,” but in the context of kinship is better rendered “begetter, progenitor” (also col-
lective). Qabru, “grave.” If the restoration at the end of the line is correct, the case ending
should be understood as an adverbial accusative of place. Line 1 begins a long anacolu-
thon, recognized as such only after the appearance of the words kispa aksipkunūši in line 4.
attunu eṭem kimtīya bānû qabra
Line 2: AD = abu, “father.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix, “my.” AMA = ummu, “moth-
er.” ŠEŠ = aḫu, “brother.” NIN = aḫātu, “sister.” Specific relatives are listed, thereby fur-
ther defining the ghosts addressed by the prayer. We should probably assume that the
bound form of the word for ghost, eṭem, has been elided from the head of the line but in
fact governs all of the nouns. The nouns should therefore be taken as genitives (see the
next line, where the oblique case form of the 1cs pronominal suffix is explicitly indicated).
The repetition of abi and ummi, the similar sounding aḫi and aḫāti, and the six instances of
the oblique 1cs pronominal suffix give the line a sing-song sound.
(eṭem) abīya abi abīya ummīya ummi ummīya aḫīya aḫātīya
Line 3: Nišūtu, “kin, relatives.” Salātu, “family, clan.” Again, eṭem has been elided
from the head of the line but governs the nouns in the genitive. The prayer reverts back to
collective kinship terms to designate the ghosts addressed. Notice how the 1cs pronominal
suffixes on each feminine noun affect the phonological rhythm of the line.

Line 4: Mala, “as much as, as many as.” Mala is an all-inclusive term, used to make
sure no dead relative is left out (and thereby, in this case, offended). KI = erṣetu, “earth.”
In a context that deals with the dead, however, erṣetu must mean “netherworld.” Although
Akkadian lost mimation (final m) in the late OB period, some scholars prefer to read the
phonetic complement that follows KI in our text as –tim, seeing in it a kind of frozen tradi-
tional orthography. Others prefer to indicate the loss of mimation explicitly by reading the
same sign as –tì. This is generalizable so that some will read a final TUM, e.g., as tu 4 while
others will read it as tum. Regardless of the convention one adopts, the meaning of the
word is not affected. Ṣalālu, “to sleep.” Sleeping is, of course, a very common way of
speaking about the state of the dead. In keeping with the plurality of address in the invo-
cation, the predicative ṣallū is 3mp. Kispa kasāpu, “to offer a funerary offering” (cognate
accusative). The preceding kinship nouns, which constitute a long anacoluthon, are the
referents of the dative pronominal suffix, –kunūši, “to you” (mp), on the verb here and on
the next four verbs in lines 5 and 6. This suffix brings the text back conceptually to attunu
in line 1. The 1cs verbs here and in lines 5 and 6 introduce the supplicant and describe the
supplicant’s ritual actions. These actions, in tandem with the verbal invocation, attempt to
get the ghosts’ attention.
mala ina erṣeti ṣallū kispa aksipkunūši
Line 5: A . MEŠ = mû, “water.” Naqû, “to pour out (a libation), sacrifice.” An actual
libation would probably have accompanied this prayer. Liquids that were libated in ritual
contexts included water, beer, wine, oil, honey, and milk among others. Only ghosts are
offered water (see Mayer, UFBG, 152). Kunnû, “to treat kindly, to honor,” and the two
verbs in the following line are speech-acts (or performatives), the speaking of which exe-
cute their ritual action (i.e., “I hereby honor you”). All three verbs, which do not seem to
refer to distinct physical acts, probably further define the intention of the libation: the
supplicant is preparing the deity to pay attention to the supplicant’s petitions. Both naqû
and kunnû are commonly found in rituals honoring a superior, which includes deities and
other non-obvious beings like dead ancestors (see CAD N/1, 337–38 and K, 541–42). No-
tice how consonance and assonance abounds in this line and the next. Though the repeat-
ed 2mp pronominal suffix adds to these phonological features, they are not limited to
such. For example, both verbs are from weak roots containing an unvoiced velar consonant
and an i theme-vowel. Also, the supplied object for the first verb, while balancing out the
longer form of the second verb and thereby creating a symmetrical line in terms of sylla-
bles, also provides a nasal consonant (m) that resonates well with the n in the second verb.
mê aqqīkunūši ukannīkunūši
Line 6: Šurruḫu (D of šarāḫu), “to glorify, to give praise, to make splendid.” Kubbutu
(D of kabātu), “to treat with honor, respect.” These two verbs are also frequently found in
ritual contexts honoring a superior. For other contexts that use both verbs together, see138UD -mi

Line 7: UD = ūmu, “day.” Ina ūmi annî, literally, “on this day,” should be translated
more idiomatically. IGI = maḫru, “front,” or pānu, “face”—both are possible. The term
should be taken here as the equivalent of ina maḫri or ina pāni, “before.” d UTU = Šamaš.
Shamash is the sun god and god of justice (see page 197). d GIŠ . GÍN . MAŠ = Gilgameš. Gilga-
mesh takes on the role of a netherworld judge in some ritual texts (see, e.g., Maqlû I 38
and the references in Parpola, LASEA 2, 204). Izuzzu, “to stand.” The ventive (–nim) on the
imperative can be translated as “here.” Line 7 contains the supplicant’s first petition: they
are invoking their ancestors in this prayer in order for the ancestors to stand on the suppli-
cant’s behalf before two important judicial deities of the netherworld, Shamash and Gil-
gamesh.
ina ūmi annî pān Šamaš Gilgameš izizzānim-ma
Line 8: Dânu, “to judge.” Dīnī, “my case.” EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision, verdict.” KUD
= parāsu, literally, “to cut, to divide,” but in this legal context “to decide.” These two
verbs frequently occur together (see CAD P, 530–32 for some examples). This line contin-
ues the supplicant’s petition.
dīnī dinā purussāya pursā
Line 9: NÍG ḪUL = mimma lemnu, “everything evil.” Rather than list all the suspected
problems, the supplicant uses the most general terms possible. Besides ensuring coverage
of the supplicant’s own problem, this manner of speaking would also make the prayer
suitable for any number of other people suffering from a wide variety of maladies. SU =
zumru, “body.” UZU . MEŠ = šīrū, “flesh.” The plural form does not change the meaning.
SA . MEŠ = šerʾānū, “sinews, veins, tendons, muscles.” GÁL = bašû, “to exist, to be.” The
form of the verb is probably a 3ms predicative (baši) plus subjunctive –u (but there are no
syllabic spellings in the MSS to confirm this). Line 9 forms the object of the verb in line 10.
mimma lemnu ša ina zumrīya šīrīya šerʾānīya bašû
Line 10: ŠU = qātu, “hand,” though a metaphorical rendering may be more appropri-
ate: “power,” “charge,” or “responsibility.” d NAM . TAR = Namtar, a netherworld deity,
whose name means “fate.” SUKKAL = šukkallu (sukkallu), “a court official, minister, counse-
lor,” is in apposition to Namtar. Šukkallu is an epithet for many gods, although the noun
that this term governs is typically a divine name (e.g., Ninshubur, šukallu of Anu; see CAD
S, 358–59 for other examples). Here the word specifies Namtar’s position in the nether-
world (erṣeti). Paqādu + ana, “to entrust, to hand over something to someone.” The sup-
plicant makes yet another petition of the ancestral ghosts, but this is the first one that
specifies their personal problem. They ask the ghosts to give the malady with which they𒐊 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G HOSTS OF M Y F AMILY 1

Line 11: d NIN . GIŠ . ZI . DA = Ningizzida, another netherworld deity. GU . ZA . LÁ = guzalû ,
literally, “throne-bearer.” Like šukkallu, this word is an epithet for deities and demons and
specifies Ningizzida’s position in the netherworld. DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “wide,”
a common modifier of erṣeti when used of the netherworld (see CAD R, 162). EN . NUN =
maṣṣartu, “watch, guard, observation, security.” Dunnunu (D of danānu), literally, “to make
strong, to reinforce,” but with maṣṣarta as the object, the verb means “to watch strictly,
carefully” (see CAD M/1, 335). The 3mp pronominal suffix on the noun becomes the direct
object of the verb in idiomatic English. The imperatives have given way to a precative in
this line. This change is simply due to the fact that the agent of the verb, Ningizzida, is not
being addressed by the speaker directly in this petition; an imperative would be inappro-
priate.
Ningizzida guzalê erṣeti rapašti maṣṣartašunu lidannin
Line 12: d BÍ . DU 8 = Bidu, a netherworld deity. There is some dispute about the proper
reading of this god’s name. Some read the name as Nedu. Ì . DU 8 . GAL = idugallu, “chief gate-
keeper.” The meaning of this word is generally agreed upon, but the proper reading of the
logogram and the precise Akkadian equivalent is unclear. (Compare Andrew George, “Sev-
en Words,” NABU 1991, #19 [followed here], CDA, 125, s.v. idugallu, the entries of the
related term atû in both CAD A/2, 516–18 [note the reference to atūgallu on p. 518] and
CDA, 31, and finally AEAD, 28, s.v. etūgallu. I thank Bob Whiting for providing a number
of references with regard to this word.) Given the mention of a third party, Bidu, at the
head of the line, we expect a precative main verb in this line, as in line 11, to continue the
supplicant’s petitions. Scurlock (352) suggests līdil, “let him shut,” from edēlu, “to shut, to
bolt.” An unpublished witness to this prayer replaces pānīšunu with EGIR -šú-[nu], arḫīšunu,
“behind them” (see Scurlock, 352). Locking a gate behind someone makes sense if the
guard is on the exterior side of the gate. (For example, after a person exits a restricted
room, the guard in the hallway makes sure the door is locked behind them.) In Bidu’s case,
he is on the interior of the netherworld, the place where the supplicant wants his affliction
to go. Bidu guards the gate so no one can get out. It makes sense, therefore, to wish Bidu to
lock the gate in front of a recent arrival to the netherworld. Upon passing through the
entrance to the netherworld, a person might wish to turn around and leave. But Bidu will
not allow it; he locks the gate in front of them.
Bidu idugal erṣeti pānīšunu līdil
Line 13: DAB . MEŠ = Ṣubbutu (D of ṣabātu), “to seize.” The verb should be understood
as an imperative to match the following one. Šūrudu (Š of [w]arādu), “to cause to go
down.” (The sign that comprises the first syllable of the verb is unclear on the tablet, but a
ŠU sign fits the traces.) The prayer reverts to imperatives in its continuation of the petition140

section. Oddly, the pronominal suffixes on the verbs are both 3ms despite the fact that all
the previous suffixes are 3mp (but note line 9’s mimma lemnu). Although corruption in the
transmission of the prayer is not out of the question (i.e., the NU sign dropped off the 3mp
suffix –šunu, twice!), this explanation seems unlikely. Perhaps the supplicant assumes the
problem (singular) has been identified at this point in the prayer (?). KUR . NU . GI 4 . A =
Kurnugi, literally, “the land of no return” (māt lā târi), “netherworld.” Notice the preposi-
tional phrase occurs at the end of the line. This is not typical syntax (compare lines 7 and
10). This position may be explained in light of the double imperative: the text intends to
align the actions of the two verbs closely, and since the location given in the prepositional
phrase only makes sense in terms of the second verb, the prepositional phrase follows it.
ṣubbitāšū-ma šūridāšu ana Kurnugi
Line 14: Anāku, “I.” ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant, slave.” Line 14 contains a stock
phrase that usually occurs toward the end of prayers (see page 413 for an example in this
volume and Mayer, UFBG, 282–83 for the generalization and exceptions). The word “serv-
ant” is a common way for a person addressing a social superior to demonstrate their lower
social status. The same hierarchical logic operates with regard to a deity. Balāṭu, “to live,
to be healthy.” Šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, to be(come) well, to be(come) whole.” The
text turns emphatically—notice the independent pronoun at the head of the line—to the
supplicant’s positive wishes for themselves. As in the previous lines of the petition, appro-
priate volitional forms, here precatives, are used to convey that which is desired. First
person forms, absent in the prayer since line 6, now dominate its remainder.

= upšaššû, “sorcery.” MU = šumu, “name,” though here something more metaphorical may
be better: “reputation, authority.” Zakû, “to be pure, to be clear.” Prepositions like aššu
and ina can be difficult to translate. Taking their range of meaning into consideration
along with the other components in the line, provide an idiomatic rendering. What does it
mean to be pure aššu sorcery ina the name of someone?
aššu upšaššê ina šumūkunu luzqi
Line 16: Arūtu, “clay pipe.” A pipe was inserted into a subterranean grave so the liv-
ing on the surface could pour libations through it to the deceased down below (as stated in
line 5). Kaṣû, “cold.” Šaqû, “to give to drink, to water, to libate.” Lines 15 and 16 are bal-
anced in terms of length and show several grammatical and phonological parallelisms.
Notice, for example, that both lines open with a prepositional phrase and end with a prec-
ative from a root comprised of a sibilant and velar consonant. Despite the grammatical
parallelism, there is conceptual movement between the lines. What is unwanted, “sorcery,”
occupies the same position in line 15 as that which will benefit from removing what is
unwanted in line 16 (“pipe,” which stands for the dead ancestors). The transfer of the
pronominal suffix –kunu from the instrumental prepositional phrase in line 15 (ina𒐊 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G HOSTS OF M Y F AMILY 1

šumūkunu) to the phrase containing the object of the supplicant’s appreciation (ana
arūtīkunu) demonstrates the nature of the “deal” the supplicant is brokering in these final
lines: “you do something for me, and I will do something for you.” The precative in this
line, therefore, is not so much a wish as it is a promise to thank the deity for acting on the
supplicant’s behalf (so also in line 17). Given the general trend of the Mesopotamian cli-
mate, cold drinking water would be particularly desirable.
ana arūtīkunu mê kaṣûti lušqi
Line 17: Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to heal, to revive, to spare, to provide support for.”
Bulliṭṭānnī-ma stands here for bulliṭānnī-ma. A direct imperative here, a kind of final plea,
accentuates this line among those otherwise dominated by precatives (lines 14–17). Dalīlū,
“praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” The two form a cognate accusative. Dalīlīka (2ms) is not
expected here; rather, dalīlīkunu, “your (2mp) praises.” Given the ubiquity of the final two
words of our prayer in Mesopotamian prayers generally, we may assume the scribe rather
mechanically appended the well-known phrase in a grammatically incorrect manner. Line
17b and its parallel in line 16b form the prayer’s concluding “promise of praise.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Two issues stand out prominently in our prayer for comparative considera-
tion: the issue of benevolent ghosts in the Hebrew Bible and “honoring” one’s
deceased relatives. 1
Before looking at these two issues briefly, it is important to consider the
idea of the collective dead in the Hebrew Bible. According to some strands of
tradition, when a person died, they were “gathered to his people” (see, e.g., Gen
25:8, 17, 35:29, 49:29, 33; Num 20:24, 27:13; etc.) or “to his ancestors” (lit.
“fathers”; Judg 2:10) and believed to “lie with his ancestors” (lit. “fathers”; see,
e.g., 1 Kgs 1:21, 2:10, 11:21, 43, 14:20, 31, etc.). This manner of speaking about
the dead shows a clear conceptual connection to the situation in our prayer, in
1
Ancestor worship and necromancy in the Hebrew Bible, the two most important issues that
arise with regard to benevolent ghosts, have received considerable attention in the last several
decades. A consensus seems to have crystallized around the idea that the ancient Israelites did
practice some form of ancestor worship and did utilize necromancy, despite the biblical prohibi-
tions. For brief overviews with literature, see Theodore J. Lewis, “Ancestor Worship,” ABD
1.240–42; Idem, “Dead,” DDD, 230–31; Idem, “Teraphim,” DDD, 844–50; J. Tropper, “Spirit of
the Dead,” DDD, 806–09; and H. Rouillard, “Rephaim,” DDD, 692–00. See also the chapter enti-
tled “A Hidden Heritage: The Israelite Cult of the Dead” in Karel van der Toorn’s Family Religion
in Babylonia, Syria, and Israel, 206–35 for an important treatment; for an archaeologically-
informed presentation, see Elizabeth Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs about the
Dead (JSOTSup 123; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992). For a dissenting view, see Brian Schmidt,
Israel’s Beneficent Dead: Ancestor Cult and Necromancy in Ancient Israelite Religion and Tradition
(Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 11; Tübingen: J.C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1994; repr.
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1996).142which the dead family members sleep together in the Netherworld, a mythologi-
cal notion that reflects the use of familial tombs/graves. Archaeological evidence
from ancient Israel supports similar familial burial practices. 2
The clearest instance of a ghost in the Hebrew Bible is found in 1 Sam 28. In
this passage Saul enlists the witch of Endor to conjure Samuel’s ghost in order to
seek his guidance—an attempted necromancy (divination via the dead). Samu-
el’s apparition is called an ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ in v. 13, which probably indicates the ghost’s
preternatural powers. Despite Samuel’s apparition and true prediction about
Saul’s fate, the Deuteronomistic Historian, in line with the Deuteronomic con-
demnations of all forms of necromancy (Deut 18:9–11) and ancestor worship
(Deut 26:14), presents Saul’s actions in a negative light. This condemnation
along with many other negative evaluations of such practices elsewhere (e.g.,
Lev 19:26–28, 20:6, 27; 2 Kgs 21:6, 23:24; Isa 8:19–22 [it seems ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ and ‫ים‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫מ‬ ֵ
are used interchangeably here], 19:3 [making mention of ‫ים‬ ‫טּ‬ ִ ‫א‬,
“ghosts,” which
is probably cognate to Akk. eṭemmu], 45:18–19, 57:6, 65:4; and Ezek 43:7–9)
strongly suggest that there were people in ancient Israel who believed in the
powers of the beneficent dead and engaged in various death-related rituals.
(Why would one prohibit something if it were not occasionally practiced?) We
do not, however, have any condoned instances in the Hebrew Bible of consulting
the dead or seeking their aid, as in our Akkadian prayer. 3 This absence has led
some interpreters to the conclusion that the biblical author’s purged these popu-
lar-level practices from the official, normative form of Yahwism as presented in
the Hebrew Bible. 4
In the context of our prayer’s description of a post-mortem provisioning
(lines 4b–6), the supplicant mentions that they “honor” their deceased family
members. The verb used here is the D stem of kabātu. This verb is cognate to BH
‫כבד‬, which occurs in the D stem in the Decalogue’s command to honor one’s
father and mother (‫ָך‬ ‫מּ‬ ֶ ‫ת־א‬
‫א‬ ֶ ְ‫ו‬ ‫יָך‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ‫ת־א‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ד‬ ‫בּ‬ ֵ ‫;כּ‬
Exod 20:12, Deut 5:16; see similarly Mal
1:6). In light of what we know about ancestor veneration in ancient Israelite
popular religion, the importance of a proper burial, and the on-going importance
of familial land and gravesites, it seems plausible to suggest that part of honor-
ing one’s parents, at least at some point in the commandment’s history, included
observing the appropriate post-mortem funerary rituals, whatever they may
have been. 5 But such rituals are not, of course, the same thing as petitioning a
dead family member, as is done in our Akkadian prayer.

See Bloch-Smith, Judahite Burial Practices and Beliefs about the Dead, passim.
In fact, Job 14:21 and Qoh 9:4–6, 10 both present the dead as utterly impotent, ignorant, and
unable to help the living.

An Incantation-Prayer: Girra 2
C HARLES H ALTON
G IRRA :
Girra was the Mesopotamian god of fire. Starting in the Ur III period and
continuing through the Old Babylonian period, the gods Girra and Gibil, another
fire god, were distinguished. However, by the Neo-Assyrian period the gods
merged and the names Girra and Gibil were used interchangeably to refer to the
same singular deity. Girra was written logographically in Akkadian as d GIŠ . BAR
and d BIL . GI .
Girra was typically regarded as the son of Anu and his consort Shala(sh).
However, he was occasionally identified as the son of Anu and Ki, Ishkur and
Shala(sh), or as a son of Nusku. His lineage made him a middling deity with
respect to rank in the pantheon; however, since he was the god of fire this ele-
vated his importance within literature and the lives of Mesopotamians. As the
agent of Nusku, Girra is mentioned as one of the occupants of Nusku’s temple in
Nippur, É-me-lám-ḫuš, “House of Awesome Radiance.” 1
Fire is both an indispensible gift and a terrifyingly destructive force. Accord-
ingly, Mesopotamian literature reflects both of these aspects. For example, Gibil
is mentioned in Enūma eliš as one of the fifty names of Marduk in which his crea-
tive ability and wisdom is celebrated:
Gibil, the one who maintains the edge of the weapon,
Who in combat with Tiamat created wonders,
Who is vast of understanding, wise, and intelligent,
Having a mind so wide that the gods in their assembly are not able
to comprehend. (VII 115–118; my translation)
On the other hand, Girra also had a fearsome nature which is illustrated in a
poem praising Shalmaneser III’s campaign to Urartu that pairs Girra with Nergal,
the god of the underworld, in an invocation: “Go, lord of kings! [ . . . ] May Ner-
gal go before you, Girra [after you . . .]” (SAA 11 17:28–29). Girra is an appro-
priate complement to Nergal since the poem celebrates the Assyrian king’s de-
struction of the Urartian army and line 9 states that the city, Til Barsip, was
1

tions 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993), #767.
145146burned. The order of the invocation is as logical as it is chilling: Nergal goes
before Shalmaneser and kills all the people while Girra sweeps in and burns up
the carnage.
Finally, the so-called Verse Account of Nabonidus contains a stylistically
beautiful line composed of two synonymously parallel stichoi that reflect an
identification of Girra with fire:
Whatever he (Nabonidus) made, he (Cyrus) had Girra burn it up,
Whatever he made, he had fire (išātu) consume it (vi 23ʹ–24ʹ). 2
Since Girra was the god of fire he was regarded as the patron deity of met-
alworkers. Also, he was acknowledged for his role in the construction of build-
ings by providing the means to bake bricks. Appropriately, his symbol was the
torch.
T HE P RAYER :
This incantation-prayer is a part of Maqlû, “burning,” an Akkadian magical
series, consisting of eight incantation tablets (I–VIII) and one ritual tablet (IX),
that was performed at the end of the month Abu to combat illegitimate witches
and witchcraft. The first eight tablets contain almost one hundred incantations.
Tablet IX lists the incantations according to their opening words (incipit) and
describes the proper rituals to employ with each. An exorcist led the incanta-
tions and associated rituals which emphasize the innocence of the supplicant as
well as their inability to counteract their enemy. The ceremony was performed
at the supplicant’s home and began at night and was continued the following
morning. Although the ceremony was complex we may break it down into three
main parts: summoning the gods, cleansing the patient’s bedroom, and perform-
ing ceremonial washings the following morning. 3
The incantation-prayer to Girra occurs in the first part of the ritual in Tablet
II, lines 76–103. Our text begins with a brief hymnic introduction that praises
Girra’s ability to guide the divine council toward right verdicts (lines 1–9). After
the hymn is the petition section of the prayer (lines 10–24). It begins with a
standard self-presentation formula (line 10) and then follows a typical sequence.
In the first section the supplicant’s situation is described in the form of a lament
(lines 11–13). The second part contains ritual actions involving figurines (lines
15–17) followed by the recitation of several petitions (lines 18–21, 23), which
marks the end of the petition section. Finally, the prayer is concluded with
praise (lines 24–27).

The petition portion of the prayer repeats invocations in order to transition
between elements of the prayer as well as to give the composition a sense of
unity and coherence. Line 14 provides a bridge between the lament and ritual
segments by contrasting the “exalted” (šurbû) and “holy” (ellu) attributes of Girra
with the wretched description of the supplicant in the lament section. Similarly,
the last invocation (line 22) transitions between the precative petitions and the
direct, imperatival petitions in lines 23 and 24 by addressing Girra as “magnifi-
cent” (šarḫu) and “eminent among the gods” (ṣīru ša ilī).
This prayer contains many poetic features. For instance, lines 18–21 promi-
nently use repetition and consonance. Each line has the same format: šunu fol-
lowed by a precative, then anāku followed by a precative. Furthermore, some of
the lines show alliteration between the two verbs. For example, limūtū and lubluṭ
(line 18) both contain dental and labial consonants (t=ṭ and m~b). Lastly, the
pronouns in this section are emphatic and highlight the petitioner’s request that
Girra intervene and punish the supplicant’s enemies while causing the supplicant
to flourish.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer. It is not a part of the prayer itself. d GIŠ . BAR = Girra. Āriru, “burning one.” The
adj. āriru is used elsewhere to describe a blazing fire or a burning lamp (see CAD A/2,
268). Bukur is the construct state of bukru, “son.” It is common for invocations to include
genealogical information for summoned deities.
Šiptu: Girra āriru bukur Anim
Line 2: Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” Dīnu, “judgment, decision, legal case.” Dīna dânu
means “to render a verdict.” KA = atmû (atwûm), “speech, word” (see CAD P, 399). Pirištu,
“secret.” Attā, “you.” Shamash is the deity most commonly associated with judging /
judgment since he looked down on the world (and underworld during the night) and saw
all of humankind’s deeds. However, when petitioners prayed to a specific deity for help
their prayers usually included a request for the deity to render a judgement on their be-
half. For an extensive treatment of the topic of divine secrecy, see Alan Lenzi, Secrecy and
the Gods: Secret Knowledge in Ancient Mesopotamia and Biblical Israel (SAAS 19; Helsinki:
The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2008). Our line is treated briefly on p. 84, n.99.
dāʾin dīnīya atmê pirišti attā-ma
Line 3: Iklēti (ekletu), “darkness.” Šunammuru (ŠD of namāru [nawārum]), “to shine, to
illuminate.” The form is a 2ms durative. This is a very appropriate description given Gir-
ra’s connection with fire.
iklēti tušnammar
Line 4: Ešâti is a fp from ešû, “confused.” Likewise, dalḫāti from dalhu, “mixed up,
perplexed.” Tušteššir is a 2ms Št-lexical durative from ešēru. We could normalize this verb
in accordance with the expected i-vowel that is often colored by the following r so that it
becomes e (Huehnergard §36.1), which would yield tušteššer. The Št-lexical of ešēru means
“to put and keep in order, to straighten, to set aright.” This verb is commonly used in in-
vocations of and petitions to deities that they might “clear up confusion” and “provide
justice” (see CAD E, 361 and Tawil, ALCBH, 151–52). Superficially, this line is a descrip-
tion of the deity’s character; however, it could also be seen as an implicit plea that the
deity act in accordance with this confession. This prayer contains many lines that function
similarly (see, e.g., line 25).
ešâti dalḫāti tušteššir
Line 5: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” GAL = rabû, “great.” EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision.” The –a
after the logogram is a phonetic complement, indicating the accusative case. Nadānu, “to
give.” In the form, tanamdin, –dd– dissimilates to –md–. Here nadānu used with purussû𒐋 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G IRRA 2

means “to make a decision,” but in other contexts it can also mean “to give an oracle” (see
CAD N/1, 54). Lines 5–7 describe Girra’s pivotal role in divine decision making. Since the
petitioner is seeking divine adjudication of their situation, they hope Girra will take up
their cause and persuade the other gods to act on their behalf.
ana ilī rabûti purussâ tanamdin
Line 6: Kâta is the genitive/accusative form of the 2ms independent pronoun. Mam-
man, “somebody, anybody.” Parāsu, “to separate, to decide.” There is a variant reading of
this line which inserts the expected lā after the first sign to yield the idiom, ša lā X =
“without X.”
ša lā kâta ilu mamman purussâ ul iparras
Line 7: Ûrtu (wuʾʾurtu), “instruction, command.” Ṭēmu, “order, decree; reason; com-
munication.”
attā-ma nādin ûrti u ṭēme
Line 8: Epēšu, “to do.” Lumnu, “evil, misery.” Arḫiš, “quickly.” Kamû, “to capture,
bind.” Maqlû does not only allow the supplicant to pray for relief from the evil spell that is
afflicting them; the ritual also includes vengeance against the person who commissioned
the magic. Therefore, lines 8 and 9 highlight the aspects of Girra’s actions that include
quickly capturing and overtaking the enemy.
ēpiš lumni attā-ma arḫiš takammu
Line 9: Lemnu, “bad, wicked.” Ayyābu (see ajābu in CAD and ajjābu in AHw), “ene-
my.” Kašādu, “to reach, to overcome.”
lemnu ayyābu takaššad arḫiš
Line 10: Anāku, “I.” NENNI = annanna (fs, annannītu), “so-and-so.” DUMU = māru,
“son.” This pronoun is used as a placeholder; during the incantation the officiant would
insert the name of the supplicant here. This line transitions from the hymnic invocations,
which describe various attributes of Girra, to the petition section of the prayer (lines 11–
24), where the supplicant begins with a description of their predicament.
anāku annanna mār annanna ša ilšu annanna ištaršu annannītu
Line 11: The transliterations and normalizations for lines 11–13 are from Abusch
(Mesopotamian Magic, 86, n.9). Kišpu, “sorcery, evil spell.” Lupputāku is a 1cs predicative of
lupputu (D of lapātu), “to afflict, to touch.” Izuzzu (uzuzzu), “to stand, to serve.” Lines 11–15012. ina

13 are similar in form: the first cola uses a predicative verb to lament the supplicant’s
cursed condition, while the second uses a preterite to describe their presence before the
deity. Mayer (UFBG, 122–45) describes the action in the second half of these cola as Hin-
wendung, the “turning.”
ina kišpi lupputākū-ma maḫarka azziz
Line 12: Abusch (“Witchcraft and the Anger of the Personal God,” 86, n.9) notes a
variant to this line: ina pān ili u amēli šuzzurākū-ma elīka x / allaka ana maḫrīka, “detestable
before god and man to you . . . I come in front of you.” IGI = pānu, “face,” though it could
also stand for maḫru, “front.” Ina pān(i)/maḫar means, “in the presence of.” LÚ = amīlu
(awīlum), “a man, a human being.” Šuzzuru (Š of nazāru), “to make detestable, to curse”
(see CAD N/2, 140, under 4. III). The form here is a 1cs predicative, which literally means
“I am made detestable.” Eli, “on, over, above, to, towards.”
ina pān ili u amēli . . . šuzzurākū-ma elīka . . .
Line 13: UGU = eli. Amāru, “to see.” Marāṣu, “to be(come) sick.” Šaplu, “under; at the
feet of.” Kamāsu, “to kneel, to bow down.”
eli āmerīya marṣākū-ma šapalka akmis
Line 14: Šurbû, “exalted, supreme.” Ellu, “pure, holy.” In contrast to the previous
three lines that describe the supplicant’s lowly condition, this line portrays Girra as exalted
and undefiled. The descriptives in this line all have –u endings and the words, ilu ellu, are
similar in sound.
Girra šurbû ilu ellu
Line 15: Eninna = inanna, “now.” Ilūtu, “divinity,” is the abstract form of ilu, “god.”
eninna ina maḫar ilūtīka rabîti
Line 16: NU = ṣalmu, “image, figurine, statue.” Kaššāpu, “sorcerer, warlock;” kaššaptu,
“witch.” LÚ and MUNUS are determinatives indicating, redundantly, the gender of the fol-
lowing nouns. ZABAR = sipparu, “bronze.” Qātukka is qātu, “hand; power; authority,” the
locative-adverbial ending –um, plus the 2ms pronominal suffix. The m assimilates to the k
of the suffix (see GAG Paradigm 5). The –um suffix corresponds to prepositional phrases in
which a genitive is proceeded by the prepositions ina or ana (see GAG §66); thus, this
phrase is translated “in your hand/power.” The statues described here were burned during
the recitation of this incantation. Afterward, the figures were trampled in water and their
remains buried (Abusch, “An Early Form of the Witchcraft Ritual Maqlû,” 123).

Line 17: Ugguru (D of egēru, “to twist”). Twisting the feet of statues was part of the Bīt
rimki rituals directed to Shamash (see J. A. Scurlock, “KAR 267//BMS 53: A Ghostly Light
on bīt rimki?,” JAOS 108.2 [1998], 203–4; see also CAD E, 42). However, the verb in the
Bīt rimki ritual (tuzār from zâru, CAD Z, 72) is different from that found in this prayer.
Foster translates this line as “I have made crossed marks(?) upon them” (661) and specu-
lates that the action of twisting refers to making cross marks on the statues. Kâša is the
dative form of the 2ms independent pronoun (GAG §41f). The verb paqādu, “to assign,
entrust,” contains an accusative 2ms pronominal suffix and likely refers to the statue while
the independent pronoun refers to the deity. The context surrounding the verb apqid indi-
cates that it should be interpreted as a performative (for more on the performative in Se-
mitic languages, see F. W. Dobbs-Allsopp, “(More) On Performatives in Semitic,” ZAH 17–
20 (2004–2007), 36–81. For a discusion of this within Akkadian see GAG §79b and 80c.
Regardless of precisely what is done to the statue, the ritual intends to bring harm to the
person that cursed the patient.
maḫarka uggiršunūtī-ma kâša apqidka
Line 18: Šunu, “they.” Mâtu, “to die.” Balāṭu, “to live, to recover.” See the introduc-
tion to the prayer above for a discussion of the structure and poetic features of lines 18–
21. The content of these lines reveals the intention behind the ritual in line 17. The peti-
tioner asks Girra to reverse the effects of the curse against them and allow them to heal,
while the person who brought the curse in the first place has a time of suffering.
šunu limūtū-ma anāku lubluṭ
Line 19: Ešēru, “to be straight, to be right.” The first half of this line is difficult to
interpret. The verb should be read either as liddappirū-ma (Tzvi Abusch, personal commu-
nication) from duppuru, “to drive away, expel,” or as litebbirū-ma from abāru, “to bind.”
From the pattern in lines 18, 20–21 of antithetical parallelism, we can assume that the first
half of the line conveys the opposite sense of the second; however, ešēru is semantically
flexible, which makes the interpretation of this line more difficult.
šunu litebbirū-ma anāku lūšir

Line 22: Šarḫu, “proud, magnificent.” Ṣīru, “outstanding, eminent.” This line reprises
the invocations in lines 1 and 14. The first three words of the phrase, šarḫu ṣīru ša ilī, all
begin with sibilants and the first two words both have r and u sounds.
Girra šarḫu ṣīru ša ilī
Line 23: Kašādu, “to defeat, to overtake.” In kušussunūtī-ma (G imperative of kašādu)
the d of kašādu assimilates into the š of the accusative 3mp suffix to form –ss– (GAG §30f
and §65b). Naḫbulu (N of ḫabālu), “to wrong, to oppress” (see CAD Ḫ, 6 for a note on this
word’s complicated semantic range). Lines 23 and 24 cluster words that begin with k, l,
and a sounds to create a sense of excitement before the unit in lines 25–27.
kāšid lemni u ayyābi kušussunūtī-ma anāku lā aḫḫabbil
Line 24: ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.” Izuzzu, see line 11. This line is a common
trope in which the supplicant promises to praise and serve the god/goddess should he/she
heal the sufferer; see Tzvi Abusch, “The Promise to Praise the God in Šuilla Prayers,” in
Biblical and Oriental Essays in Memory of Wiliam L. Moran (ed. Agustinus Gianto; BibOr 48;
Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 2005), 5.
anāku aradka lublu  lušlim-ma maḫarka luzziz
Line 25: MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. Bēlu, “lord.” The use of –ma puts focus on the
personal pronoun, “you (and not some other deity) are my god” (see GAG §123a). Lines
25–27 comprise a structural unit; the lines are bound together with the repetition of attā-
ma. Lines 25 and 26 each consist of two phrases two words in length beginning with attā-
ma. The two lines build to a crecendo into line 27, which again begins with attā-ma but is
one long line instead of two short clauses. The first two lines confess fidelity to the deity
and recognize his ability to help the petitioner. The final line is framed as a description of
the deity, yet it is a veiled plea for the deity to rise up and act in accordance with the con-
fession, “You are the one restoring my fortune.”
attā-ma ilī attā-ma bēlī
Line 26: Dayyānu “judge.” Rēṣu, “helper, supporter.” We would expect rēṣī here; pos-
sibly the line below has influenced the choice of the suffix.

“to return an act of kindness; to wreak vengeance” (see CAD G, 74). The logograms TU 6
and ÉN represent šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording,” and are the concluding formula ra-
ther than part of the prayer itself (see CAD Š/3, 86). They are not translated.

Line 28: The rubric, typically written in Sumerian, identifies the kind of incantation-

bronze figurines.” Ušburuda means “witchcraft-releasing.”
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Several phrases and words within the prayer to Girra are similar in structure
and meaning to biblical analogues. For instance, in line 24 the phrase maḫarka
luzziz literally means, “may I stand before you”; however, just like the analogous
phrase in BH, ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ‫עמ‬ , it is used idiomatically to indicate service to an official or
deity (HALOT, 841). For example, Num 16:9 “Does it seem too small a thing to
you that the god of Israel has separated you from the community of Israel...to
perform the service (‫ת‬ ‫ֹד‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ת־ע‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫בֹד‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫)ל‬
of Yahweh’s tabernacle and to stand before
(‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫מֹד‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ַ‫ל‬ ְ‫)ו‬ the community to minister to them (‫ם‬ ‫ת‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ְ‫”?)ל‬
This prayer also contains poetic features that are similar to those employed
by biblical writers. For instance, lines 18–21 cluster antonym word pairs within
the same line: die | live  bind | straight  expire | flourish  weak | strong. Ex-
amples of biblical passages with similar structure include Amos 5:15, “Hate evil
and love good” ( ‫טוֹב‬ ‫בוּ‬ ‫ה‬ ֱ ‫א‬ ֶ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ע‬ ‫וּ־ר‬
‫א‬ ְ‫נ‬ ‫שׂ‬ ִ ) and Psalm 107:26, “They went up to the sky /
they went down to the depths” (‫הוֹמוֹת‬ ‫)ת‬.

In addition to sharing certain poetic features, the psalmists and the author
of this prayer to Girra use similar divine titles and descriptions. In Ps 40:18b and
the parallel passage in Ps 70:6b the psalmist confesses, “You are my help (Ps 40,
‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ ְ‫ז‬ ‫;ע‬
Ps 70, ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫)ע‬
and my deliverer,” which is semantically similar to line 26 in
the prayer to Girra: “you are my helper” (rēṣūya). Of course confessions such as
“you are my god” and “you are my lord” in line 25 are quite common within
biblical literature (e.g., Ps 63:2: “O Elohim, (you are) my god, I search for you,”
‫ךּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ח‬ ֲ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫ה‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ; and Ps 16:2: “I said to Yahweh, ‘You are my lord,’” ‫י‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ

The 1cs perfect has been restored on the basis of the Greek and Syriac traditions; the MT reads
‫תּ‬ ְ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬.154Even though the Bible does not contain apotropaic rituals to counter witch-
craft, it does recount rituals that contain curses. When individuals or communi-
ties concluded a covenant, curses were invoked upon whomever violated the
agreement (e.g., Exod 24). Sometimes biblical writers linked times of adversity
with these curses. For instance, the Chronicler asserts that the land finally re-
ceived its sabbath rest because Yahweh invoked the curse of exile (2 Chron
36:21; see Lev 25:4, 26:34; Jer 29:10). Instead of a declaration of innocence and
a specific ritual to ward off curses as seen in the prayer to Girra, biblical writers
prescribed confession of sin and repentance to reverse the effects of curses asso-
ciated with oaths (e.g., Lev 26:40).
Numbers 5:11–31 describes a curse embedded within a ritual used when a
man suspected that his wife committed adultery. In these instances the husband
would bring his wife before a priest. The priest mixed dust from the tabernacle
floor with holy water, and the woman took an oath denying that she had an
adulterous encounter. After this, the priest wrote curses on a scroll and washed
the ink off into the water and dust mixture. He then gave the mixture to the
woman to drink. Presumably, an innocent woman would be unharmed while a
guilty one would suffer the curses she imbibed. 3

dimensions, see Gerald A. Klingbeil, Bridging the Gap: Ritual and Ritual Texts in the Bible (IBRSup

An Incantation-Prayer: Gods of the Night 1
T ZVI A BUSCH
G ODS OF THE N IGHT :
See page 71.
T HE P RAYER :
Context: This address to the gods of the night is the first incantation-prayer
in the magical series Maqlû, “burning.” Maqlû is the longest and most important
Mesopotamian text concerned with combating witchcraft. This composition
comprises eight tablets of incantations and a ritual tablet. The incantation tab-
lets record the text of almost one hundred incantations directed against witches
and witchcraft; in the ritual tablet, these incantations are cited by incipit, and
alongside each citation appropriate ritual directions are prescribed. Long thought
to be a random collection of witchcraft materials, an important breakthrough in
the understanding of Maqlû came with the discovery that it was a single complex
ceremony. This ceremony was performed during a single night and into the fol-
lowing morning at the end of the month Abu (July/August). 1
But the present text of Maqlû stands at the end of a long and complex liter-
ary and ceremonial development. An earlier version of the ceremony would have
been performed in the daytime and would have begun with what is now the
sixth incantation (I 73ff.), which was originally addressed to Shamash. After the
ceremony was transferred to the nighttime, the present introductory section, I 1–
72, was added. In line with its new ceremonial context, this section now opens
with the address to the gods of the night. This opening section is an indictment
of the witch. The incantation-prayer draws together magical and legal imagery
1
For the nature of Maqlû, see I. T. Abusch, “Mesopotamian Anti-Witchcraft Literature: Texts and
Studies. Part 1: The Nature of Maqlû: Its Character, Divisions and Calendrical Setting,” JNES 33
(1974), 251–62; repr. in Tzvi Abusch, Mesopotamian Witchcraft (Ancient Magic and Divination 5;
Leiden: Brill, 2002), 99–111. For its history, see idem, “An Early Form of the Witchcraft Ritual
Maqlû and the Origin of a Babylonian Magical Ceremony,” in Lingering over Words: Studies in
Ancient Near Eastern Literature in Honor of William L. Moran (ed. T. Abusch, et al; HSS 37; Atlanta:
Scholars Press, 1990), 1–57; repr. in Abusch, Mesopotamian Witchcraft, 113–62.
157158for this purpose. It should be emphasized that this incantation-prayer is not a
simple prayer in which a stable negative situation is described and a change
asked for. Rather, it is a speech that accompanies a ritual act and gives ex-
pression to a dynamic situation. The text thus reflects the changes in state un-
dergone by the patient and the witch from the beginning of the ritual to its end.
It is possible that an earlier form of this text ended with line 20 and that lines
21–35 represent an innovation.
Structure: The incantation-prayer is in the form of a speech in the first per-
son made by the patient, who invokes the heavenly gods of Anu (lines 1–3). The
patient first presents his plaint in the form of a description of the acts that the
witch performed against him and of the resultant state (lines 4–12). On this ba-
sis, the patient asks the gods to take up his case (lines 13–14). The patient pro-
claims that he has caused the accused witch to be present in the judgment in the
form of figurines of male and female witches (lines 15–17) and asks that the
witch be punished for having sought—perhaps by means of accusations—
unmotivated evil against the patient and that the witch’s bewitchment be re-
leased (lines 18–20). The patient asks to be cleared (of bewitchment and any
imputed guilt) by means of a standard set of plants—these plants usually serve
to purify, but here they function as (an oath and) a form of juridical ordeal
(lines 21–24). The patient, having proven his innocence and having been cleared
(lines 25–26), is now able to assert that since the witch’s utterance belongs to an
evil witch, her accusation has been refuted (lines 27–28), and to ask the gods of
the night to bring the witch to justice and indict her, and the night watches to
release the witchcraft (lines 29–30). By means of a magical identification and
act, the patient expresses the wish that the organs of speech of the witch be de-
stroyed (lines 31–33). Finally, he asserts that the witch’s actions and accusations
have been wholly nullified (lines 34–35) by the gods of the night (line 36).

Lines 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This superscript marks the begin-
ning of the ritual wording; it is not part of the prayer. Šasû, “to call.” The form alsīkunūši is
a 1cs preterite plus 2mp dative suffix, which functions here as an accusative. The preterite
forms of šasû in lines 1–3 are examples of performative preterites and should be translated
“I call.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Mušītu, “night.”
alsīkunūši ilū mušīti
Line 2: Itti, “with,” bears a 2mp pronominal suffix. Kallatu, “bride.” Kuttumtu, “veiled,
covered.”
ittīkunu alsi mušītu kallatu kuttumtu
Line 3: Barārītu, “twilight.” Qablītu, “midnight.” Namārītu, “dawn.” These are the
names of the three watches of the night. U, “and.”
alsi barārītu qablītu u namārītu
Line 4: This line describes the actions of the witch; line 5, her utterances. Line 4 re-
fers to the witch’s act of silencing the victim (=speaker); line 5 refers to the witch’s act of
leveling an accusation against the victim. Aššu, “because,” at the beginning of line 4 gov-
erns lines 4–12; hence, the verbs in these lines are in the subjunctive (in this context note
amruṣu in line 7) and are singular, not plural. MUNUS . UŠ 11 . ZU = kaššaptu, “witch.” Kuššupu
(D of kašāpu), “to bewitch.” The form ukaššipanni is a 3cs preterite plus a 1cs accusative
pronominal suffix (so also the verb in line 5).
aššu kaššaptu ukaššipanni
Line 5: Elēnītu, “deceitful,” is used substantively here. Ubburu (D of abāru), “to ac-
cuse” (<“to bind”).
elēnītu ubbiranni
Line 6: DINGIR . MU = ilī, “my god.” Ištarī, “my goddess.” Šussû (Š of nesû), “to drive
away, to cause to be estranged.” The 3cs preterite is normally ušassi; ušassû adds the sub-
junctive –u. UGU . MU = elīya, “from, upon me.”

Line 7: Amāru, “to see.” The participle is used substantively and bears a 1cs pronomi-
nal suffix. Marāṣu, “to be(come) ill, sickening.” Amruṣu: so in one Nineveh MS . Other Nine-
veh MSS read am-ru-uṣ.
eli āmerīya amruṣu anāku
Line 8: Emēdu, “to beset (with).” The form is a 1cs predicative; the speaker is the
subject of this passive construction (this subject would have been the first object in an
active construction), and lā ṣalālu, “not sleeping,” is the object (it would have been the
second object in an active construction). GI 6 = mūšu, “night.” Mūša and urra are accusa-
tives of time.
emdēku lā ṣalālu mūša u urra
Line 9: Qû, lit. “thread, string,” but here “gag.” Mitallû (Gtn of malû), “to fill continu-
ally.” The form is a 3cs durative with subjunctive. KA = pû, “mouth.”
qû imtanallû pīya
Line 10: Upuntu (upumtu), a type of flour, here stands for food in general. KA . MU =
pīya (see line 9). Parāsu, “to block, to keep distant.” The verb is a 3cs preterite with sub-
junctive; qû from line 9 is the subject.
upunti pīya iprusu

“wailing, mourning.”

ing. The form is a cp impv. with 1cs dative pronominal suffix. DINGIR . MEŠ GAL . MEŠ = ilū

The inf. with 1cs pronominal suffix is functioning nominally; thus, “my speaking,” which
denotes here the supplicant’s legal case against the witch.
izizzānim-ma ilū rabûtu šimâ dabābī
Line 14: Dīnu, “legal case.” Dânu (diānu), “to judge.” Alaktu here has the meaning
“(oracular) decision.” Alaktu, from alāku, “to go,” refers to the movements of heavenly
bodies. Lamādu normally means “to learn, to come to know,” but in this context the verb
has a revelatory connotation. The phrase dīnī dīnā alaktī limdā here is equivalent to dīnī
dīnā purussâya pursā, “judge my case, give a decision.” See T. Abusch, “Alaktu and Hala-
khah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 (1987), 15–42.

ēpuš ṣalam kaššāpīya u kaššaptīya
Line 16: Ša, “of.” Ēpišu, “sorcerer.” Muštēpištu, “the woman who instigates sorcery,” or
perhaps in some instances, just “sorceress.” Ēpišu is sometimes coupled with ēpištu.
ša ēpišīya u muštēpištīya
Line 17: Šakānu, “to set, to place.” The performative preterite here has the force of a
punctual present, “I set (it).” Ina šapli idiomatically means “at the feet (of).” The noun
bears a 2mp pronominal suffix. The durative adabbub has the force of a durative present, “I
am (now) pleading.”
aškun ina šaplīkunū-ma adabbub dīnī
Line 18: Aššu, see line 4. Epēšu, “to perform” here. The witch is the subject; the sup-
plicant is the referent of the 1cs dative suffix (–am, with loss of final m, –a). Lemnu, “evil.”
Šiteʾʾû (Gtn of šeʾû), “to seek constantly.” The form is a 3cs preterite with a 1cs dative pro-
nominal suffix. Banû, “good.” Both adjectives are fem. pl.
aššu īpuša lemnēti išteʾʾâ lā banâti
Line 19: Šī, “she.” Mâtu, “to die.” Anāku, “I.” Balāṭu, “to live, to be well.” Both verbs
are precative: the first is 3cs, referring to the supplicant’s wish for the witch; the second is
1cs, referring to the supplicant’s desire for himself.

Line 20: Kišpū (usually plural), ruḫû, and rusû are all words referring to sorcery.
Pašāru, “to release.” Lū pašrū is a precative in lū, “may, let,” plus the 3mp predicative
form. It is possible that this construction is an asseverative: “verily are her witchcraft . . .
released.”
kišpūša ruḫûša rusûša lū pašrū
Line 21: The main verbs in lines 21–24 are all precatives with a 1cs pronominal accu-
sative suffix; each initial half of the line names a plant and is followed by the precative
verb, indicating the supplicant’s wish for what the plant should do to him. GIŠ . ŠINIG = bīnu,
“tamarisk.” Ullulu (D of elēlu), “to clear.” The relative clause introduced by ša modifies
tamarisk. Qimmatu, “crown,” here is an accusative of respect. Šarû, “to be copious,” is a
3ms predicative with subjunctive.
bīnu lillilanni ša qimmatu šarû
Line 22: GIŠ . GIŠIMMAR = gišimmaru, “date-palm,” is feminine here (see māḫirat).
Pašāru, see line 20. Lipšuranni is a 3cs precative plus a 1cs accusative suffix. Māḫirat is a fs
participle in construct from maḫāru, “to withstand,” it modifies date-palm. Kalû, “all, total-
ity.” IM = šāru, “wind.”
gišimmaru lipšuranni māḫirat kalû šāri
Line 23: Ú . IN . NU . UŠ = maštakal, “soapwort,” is feminine here (see malâta). Ubbubu (D
of ebēbu), “to cleanse.” KI -tì = erṣeti, “earth.” Malû, “to be(come) full, to fill.” Malâta is a
3fs transitive parsāku form. Both here and in line 24 malâta is in the subjunctive.
maštakal libbibanni ša erṣeti malâta
Line 24: GIŠ . ŠE . Ù . SUḪ 5 = terinnatu, “cone,” is usually understood as the plural of terin-

malâta is intransitive. ŠE . AM = šeʾu, “grain,” indicates the seeds with which the cone is
filled.
terinnatu lipšuranni ša šeʾa malâta
Line 25: Ina maḫri, “before, in the presence of.” Elēlu, “to be(come) pure.” The verbs
ētelil, ētebib, and azzaku in lines 25–26 are in the perfect, indicating that the state of clean-
liness or innocence described has now been achieved as a result of the wishes of the previ-
ous lines (21–24). All three verbs are 1cs. Kīma, “like, as.” Ú . KI . KAL = sassatu, “grass.”

Line 26: Ebēbu, “to be(come) clean.” Zakû, “to be(come) innocent.” The t of the per-
fect assimilates to the z of the root (–zt– becomes –zz–). Lardu, “nard.”
ētebib azzaku kīma lardi
Line 27: Tû, “spell, incantation.” Lemutte is an adjective, “evil,” modifying kaššaptu
(“her spell being that of an evil witch”), and not the predicate of the clause. Note the
transformations in our text achieved by the use of forms of lemēnu as additions or replace-
ments: thus kaššaptu in line 4 becomes kaššaptu lemutte here in line 27; aššu . . . ukaššipanni
. . . ubbiranni in lines 4–5 becomes aššu īpuša lemnēti in line 18.
tûša ša kaššapti lemutte
Line 28: Turru (D of târu), “to turn back.” The form of both turrat and kaṣrat is a 3fs
predicative. INIM -sa = amāssa: amātu (awātum), “word,” plus a 3fs pronominal suffix (–tš–
becomes –ss–). EME = lišānu, “tongue.” The n assimilates to the š of the 3fs pronominal
suffix. Kaṣāru, “to tie up, to bind.”
turrat amāssa ana pīša lišāšša kaṣrat
Line 29: ina UGU = ina muḫḫi, lit., “on top of”; here “on account of.” Maḫāṣu, “to
strike.” The form of limḫaṣūši is a 3mp precative plus a 3fs accusative suffix. Here maḫāṣu
connotes intimidation, humiliation, and accusation. Ilū mušīti, “the gods of the night,” are
the subjects of the verb.
ina muḫḫi kišpīša limḫaṣūši ilū mušīti
Line 30: 3 = šalāš. EN . NUN . MEŠ = maṣṣarātu (sg. maṣṣartu), “observation, guard,
watch.” The reading lip-šu-ra ! is an emendation of lip-šu-ru; the attested forms in the MSS
are lipšurū, lipšur, and lipašširū. In view of the divergence in the readings, the verb should
be emended to lipšurā in agreement with the feminine plural subject (maṣṣarātu).

Line 32: Qabû, “to speak.” In view of the equations in line 31, it is clear that, contrary
to most earlier translations, the subject of iqbû here must be pû, “mouth,” and that of īpušu16433. šá i-pu-šú kiš-pi ki-ma MUN liš-ḫar-miṭ

in line 33 must be lišānu, “tongue.” ḪUL -tì = lemutti, “evil, wickedness.” Itattuku (Gtn of
natāku), “to drip ever away.” The form of the verb is 3cs precative.

Line 33: Lišḫarmiṭ is a Š precative 3cs from naḫarmuṭu, “to dissolve.” There is a vari-
ant that reads liḫḫarmiṭ, an N precative 3cs. Semantically, liḫḫarmiṭ seems to be the better
reading, but it is only attested in two MSS , one Babylonian, the other from Nippur, whereas
lišḫarmiṭ is found in four MSS , including all Nineveh texts.
ša īpušu kišpī kīma ṭabti lišḫarmiṭ
Line 34: Kiṣru, “bond, knot.” Puṭṭuru (D of paṭāru), “to release.” Ḫulluqu (D of ḫalāqu),
“to nullify.” Both puṭṭurū and ḫulluqā are predicatives; the former is 3mp, the latter 3fp.
The reading ḫulluqā is to be preferred over the variant ḫulluqū because its subject is a fem-
inine plural noun epšētūša, “her deeds.” Lines 34–35 assert that the actions (line 34) and
the utterances (line 35, actually accusations) of the witch have been nullified. These two
lines parallel the initial description of the witch’s deeds in lines 4–5: 34  4 and 35  5.
kiṣrūša puṭṭurū epšētūša ḫulluqā
Line 35: Kal, “all” (see kalû in line 22). Amâtu is the plural of amātu (see line 28). A
variant in this line shows the precative limlâ rather than malâ (compare line 23). EDIN =
ṣēru, “field.”
kal amâtūša malâ ṣēra
Line 36: Ina qibīt, “according to the command of/that.” Qibīt in construct introduces a
subordinate clause, which follows in the second half of the line. TU 6 . ÉN marks the end of
the ritual wording (compare ÉN in line 1). This last line sounds like a standard legitimating
formula and therefore blurs the boundary between supplicatory and incantatory speech
(see page 20 in the general introduction). Note, however, the variant in line 35, which, if
accepted, would give this last sentence a very different tone.
ina qibīt iqbû ilū mušīti TU 6 . ÉN
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Our incantation-prayer, as many others in Maqlû and elsewhere, accompa-
nies a dynamic ritual and thus gives expression to the changes in state experi-
enced by the patient and witch throughout the ritual. In this context we note
that some psalms of individual lament seem, because of the apparent use of the
perfect, to contain not only the petitioner’s prayer, but also an expression of
trust that the deity has heard him (e.g., Ps 6). Some have taken this to mean that
the psalm is part of a ritual and that the statement of confidence is the suppli-
cant’s response to the deity’s decision spoken by the priest in the form of an ora-𒐌 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : G ODS OF THE N IGHT 1

cle after the prayer itself, an interpretation to which I do not subscribe. But
should this interpretation be correct, then the laments containing the statement
of confidence should be compared to our incantation-prayer, for they too would
have been part of a dynamic ritual. 1
As noted earlier, this incantation-prayer was recited at night to the gods of
the night sky. For biblical texts recited as part of a night ritual, see, e.g., Hans-
Joachim Kraus, Psalms 1–59: A Continental Commentary (trans. Hilton C. Oswald;
Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1993), 179.
For a description of the evil actions of one’s enemies and their unjust accu-
sations, as well as the victim’s imprecations against these enemies, see Ps 109.
For the prohibition against witchcraft in the Hebrew Bible, see Exod 22:17.
Pentateuchal legislations object to some practices of divination and magic large-
ly because these practices are associated with foreigners (e.g., Deut 18:9ff., Lev
19:26, 31, and 20:6, 27). Magic and monotheism are not incompatible, and of
course magic was practiced in ancient Israel. 2
Sigmund Mowinckel argued with some justice that ‫ן‬ ֶ‫ו‬ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫י‬ ֵ‫ל‬ ‫פּוֹע‬
of the Psalms
were malevolent magicians similar to the Mesopotamian witches (see his
Psalmenstudien I: ʾÅwän und die individuellen Klagepsalmen (Kristiania: in Kommis-
sion bei Jacob Dybwad, 1921).
A few points of specific interest in the Hebrew Bible: For line 14, compare
perhaps usages of ‫יב‬ ‫ר‬ ִ involving God adjudicating a case (see, e.g., Pss 35:1,
63:1). Alaktu in line 14 with the meaning “(oracular) decision” should be com-
pared with later Hebrew and Aramaic ‫הלכתא‬ / ‫הלכה‬. For the meaning of the Ak-
kadian and the relationship with the Hebrew terms, see Abusch, “Alaktu and
Halakhah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 (1987), 15–42. For the
cleansing motif in lines 21–24, compare Ps 51:4. With the striking in line 29, see
Ps 3:8, “deliver me, O my God! For you slap all my enemies in the face; you
break the teeth of the wicked.” For line 32 and the melting of wax, see Mic 1:4
and Ps 68:3.

An Incantation-Prayer: Ishtar 24
A NNA E LISE Z ERNECKE
I SHTAR :
Ishtar (Sum. Inana) is the most prominent goddess of the Mesopotamian
pantheon, of prime importance in all stages of history, and venerated in many
(most!) places (e.g., Arbela, Ashur, Niniveh, Uruk, and Babylon), partly with
special names. 1 Different genealogical places in the pantheon are attributed to
her: Inana / Ishtar can be described as daughter of An, the god of heaven, or of
Sin, the moon-god (see Ishtar 2:5, 105 on pages 261 and 278 of this volume). In
contrast to other female deities, she is often not the wife of a mighty god but
independent, though in Sumerian sources she can be An’s consort or, in Ashur,
married to the god Ashur. Her most prominent husband is Dumuzi (biblical
Tammuz; Ishtar 24 was transmitted as part of a ritual for Ishtar and Dumuzi). As
she is the epitome of a female goddess, from Old Babylonian times onwards, her
name with the divine determinative ( d ištaru) is used as an appellative, meaning
“goddess,” 2 especially—with suffix—for the personal protective deity (see Ishtar
2:39, 67, 68, 86, beginning on page 267 of this volume). She is the goddess of
the planet Venus in both its form as evening star and morning star. Most often,
she is characterized as goddess of love, sexuality, and war. 3 This combination of
“competences” has been explained as the result of the fusion of several deities. 4
Several sources emphasize her androgynity. 5 Interestingly, her sexual aspect
does not make her a mother-goddess—she is only rarely presented as mother,
though her stay in the Netherworld results in the loss of fertility. 6 She is promi-
nent in several mythical texts, either as a warlike goddess (e.g. Descent to the

169170Netherworld, Agushaya) or, mostly in lyrical compositions, as beloved of Du-
muzi. 7 Ishtar is often associated with lions.
In both prayers addressed to her that are part of this volume (Ishtar 2 and
24), her astral and warlike aspects are particularly stressed. Especially in Ishtar
2, she is the great and omnipotent goddess whose competence is universal and
who can save from the realm of chaos and death. She is the high goddess, the
addressee in case of problems with the personal protective deities (see Ishtar
2:85, 86 on page 275). This coincides with the fact that there is only dubious
evidence that she was anyone’s personal deity herself, though her minister
Ninshubur is known in this function. 8
Both prayers, and especially their invocations, cannot be read as “dogmatic
treatises” of Ishtar’s characteristics. Rather, they emphasize those aspects that
are important for the intention of the text: the supplicant wants something,
therefore they stress, on the one hand, the characteristics appealed to, and, on
the other, traits that they experience and interpret them in a positive way.
Ishtar is related to the levantine Astarte 9 and is one of the probable candi-
dates for the identification of the “queen of heaven” (‫השׁמים‬ ‫)מלכת‬ in Jer 7:18;
44:17–19, 25. 10 In addition, the name Esther (‫ר‬ ‫תּ‬ ֵ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫)א‬
has been discussed as possi-
bly derived from Ishtar. 11

The text of the prayer is transmitted with small variants in six manuscripts.
As none of them is unbroken, though three of them transmit the prayer in its
entirety, the text given here is eclectic and usually follows the majority of the
manuscripts.
The prayer is transmitted in different ritual contexts. The editions of Farber
and Schwemer both publish manuscripts in which it forms part of a ritual ad-
dressed to Ishtar and Dumuzi. The supplicant is suffering because magical rites
have been performed against them; figurines of them have been buried in a
grave. The ritual aims at liberating the supplicant from the netherworld while
sending the sorcerers into it. The mythical background for the ritual is Ishtar’s
descent into the netherworld. 13 The prayer is the first spoken part of the ritual

after the preparations. Nevertheless, the supplicant does not introduce them-
selves by name; it is inscribed on the figurine of them which is formed before
the recitation of the prayer.
The prayer begins with an invocation (lines 1–8) in which Ishtar’s greatness
is praised, especially the effect of her command (ina qibītīki Ištar, lines 4 and 7)
on the suffering. In the following lines (9–14), the supplicant presents them-
selves as suffering and appealing to Ishtar, asking her to decide their case and
hoping to witness her aspects just praised. In lines 15–22, the machinations of
sorcerers are identified as the root of the supplicant’s sufferings, ending with the
proclamation of the decision to act magically against them (line 22). The prayer
ends (23–27) with the supplicant’s entrusting themselves to Ishtar’s might and
pleas.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, the superscription of the prayer, which is not part of the text to be
recited. Šiptu is usually translated as “incantation” (CAD Š/3, 86); but it should be under-
stood as a technical term for the beginning of the text to be recited in a ritual; thus, “ritual
wording” or the like. KÙ = ellu, “pure, clean, holy.” Šaqû (m), šaqūtu, šaqītu (f), “high,
elevated”; as the adjective is the regens of a construct chain, the –u at the end is not ex-
pected. DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū “gods.” Igigû, the gods of heaven, see Ishtar 2, notes to line 3. In
MS HH, the line is longer: šaqūt ilī šaruḫti Igigî, “most high among the gods, splendid one of
the Igigi!” (Šarḫu, “proud, splendid.”) In all preserved texts, the name Ishtar (lines 1, 4, 7,
8, 15) is written differently, the single MSS are not consistent: d INANA , d 15 , and d IŠ 8 . DAR .
šiptu: elletum Ištar šaqūtu ilī Igigî
Line 2: Epēšu, “to do, to make.” This verb is used four times in this prayer (lines 2, 14
twice, and 22). In all other contexts, its special connotation is important: besides the neu-
tral sense “to do,” it can also mean “to perform” (a ritual, magic, especially hostile magic,
‘Schadenzauber’; see Schwemer, Rituale, 1, n.2.). Anuntu, “fight, combat.” Šakānu, “to put,
to place, to arrange.” Tuquntu (tuqumtu), “battle.” Note Ishtar 2:6 (page 261): the second
part of the line is identical.
ēpišat anunti šākinat tuqunti
Line 3: Gitmālu (m), gitmāltu (f), “perfect, ideal.” d 15 is not only a way of writing the
name of the goddess Ishtar, but also the noun ištaru, “goddess.” As gitmāltu ištarāti is a
construct chain, the case vowel ending gitmāltu is not expected.
šaruḫtu gitmāltu ištarāti
Line 4: Qibītu, “command, order.” The suffix is written –ka (2ms) here rather than the
expected –ki (2fs), but it certainly refers to Ishtar. Ina qibītīka / qibītīki at the head of this
line connects the line to lines 7 and 23. Ušteššerē is 3fp durative from šutēšuru (Št pass. of
ešēru), “to be put in order, to be guided aright.” Tenēštu, “people, personnel,” pl. tenēšētu,
“humankind.” The ending is grammatically nominative. In lines 4–11 the reading in MS HH
is partly different. These differences are normalized and translated at the end of every
note. Variant HH: ina qabêki Ištar iššerā te[nēšētu], “at your speaking, Ishtar, humankind is
well.”
ina qibītīka Ištar ušteššerē tenēšēte
Line 5: LÚ . GIG = marṣu, “sick person.” Balāṭu, “to live, to be healed.” Amāru, “to see,
to look at.” The participle, which modifies marṣu, is bound to the following substantive ( IGI
= pānū, “face”). An “overhanging” u on a participle in construct is not uncommon in SB𒐍 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : I SHTAR 24

„hymnischen“ Literatur, 2 Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 14/1–2; Stuttgart:
Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 2.41 for examples). Besides Ishtar’s verbal action (lines 4, 7),
the invocation is structured by the effects of seeing her face on the suffering (lines 5, 8).
See Ishtar 2:40–41 (see page 267). Variant HH: mītu iballuṭ, “the dead one lives.”
marṣu iballuṭ āmiru pānīki
Line 6: Napṭuru (N of paṭāru), “to be loosened, to be untied.” The form is a 3cs dura-
tive. Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, liability, sin.” Tebû, “to rise up, to get up.” Arḫiš, “quickly, hasti-
ly.” Variant HH: kasû ippaṭṭar, “the one who is bound is untied.”
ippaṭṭar eʾiltašu itebbi arḫiš
Line 7: See line 4. We expect ina qibītīki rather than ina qibītki. Perhaps the BIT sign is
to be read biti. Nāṭilu, “seeing”; lā nāṭilu, “blind.” IGI . LÁ = amāru, “to see, to look at.” d ZÁ-
LAG = nūru, “light.” Variant HH: lā nāṭi[lu, “the blin[d one . . . ].”
ina qibītīki Ištar lā nāṭilu immar nūra
Line 8: See line 5. Ešēru, “to be well, to thrive, to prosper.” Išaru, “straight, right, in
order”; lā išaru, “not right.” The participle āmiru modifies lā išaru. See Ishtar 2:41. HH:
iššer Ištar lā išaru ina [ . . . ], “the unfortunate becomes all right, Ishtar, in. . . .”
iššer Ištar lā išaru āmiru pānīki
Line 9: Anāku, “I.” Šumruṣu, “suffering” (adj.). The use of šumruṣu refers back to the
praise of Ishtar’s effect on the marṣu (line 5; marṣu and šumruṣu come from the same root).
IGI = maḫru, “front”; (ina) maḫar, “before, in the presence of (someone).” Kamāsu, “to
kneel, to squat down.” Izuzzu, “to stand, to serve, to be present.” Kamāsu and izuzzu are
both preterites which can be interpreted as performative (Koinzidenzfall); see Mayer,
UFBG, 181–209. Variant HH: anāku šumruṣāku maḫarki [ . . . ], “I am suffering, in front of
you [ . . . ].”
anāku šumruṣu maḫarki akmis azziz
Line 10: Dipāru, “torch.” The fem. form only occurs here. Dânu (diānum), “to judge,”
often with dīnu (“legal decision, lawsuit”) as object (figura etymologica). The verb is an
infinitive with a locative-adverbial suffix (see Farber, 253; GAG §66f) in two MSS (aa, gg);
the other two MSS (b, HH) read dânu. Saḫāru, “to go around, to turn (to), to search.” Again,
the preterite is performative.

ludes to ippaṭṭar eʾiltašu in line 6. Kasītu, “(magical) constraint”; see line 6 in MS HH, which
mentions the kasû, “bound, captive.” Variant HH: usḫī murṣī lippaṭ[ir. . . ], “tear out my
illness, may it be loosened [ . . .].”
pānīki ātamar lippaṭir kasītī
Line 12: It is a bit of a problem to determine from which verb tumarrê is derived.
Farber, 253, analyzes it tentatively as a G or D stem 2fs durative from marû, “to do slow-
ly”; see Seux, 458, n.6. Ešû, “confused.” Dalḫu, “troubled, disturbed.”
lā tumarrê ešâku u dalḫāku
Line 13: Tarkullu, “wooden post, pole.” Maḫṣu, “beaten, smitten.” Emû (ewûm), “to
become.” The form is a 3fs predicative. ZI = napištu, “throat, life, self.”
kīma ša ina tarkullī maḫṣu emât napištim
Line 14: Epēšu, “to do, to make.” See line 2. Epiš is a 3ms predicative; ēpuš is a 1cs
preterite. Qabû, “to say, to speak, to command.”
epiš taqbî ēpuš
Line 15: d INANA = Ištar. Lū . . . lū, “either . . . or.” Kaššāpu, “sorcerer.” Kaššaptu, “sor-
ceress.” Lines 15–20 are one syntactical unit with lines 19 and 20 as main clauses.
Ištar lū kaššāpī lū kaššaptī
Line 16: Attī, “you” (2fs). Tīdê (2fs) and īdû (1cs with subjunctive) are forms of edû,
“to know.”
ša attī tīdê-ma anāku lā īdû
Line 17: Riksu, “binding, knot, bond; assemblage (of offerings).” Kišpu, “sorcery, evil
spell.” ḪUL . GIG = zīru, “hate.” ZI . KU 5 . RU . DA = zikurudû, “cutting of life.” Two MSS begin the
line with ša instead of ina. Rikis kišpi zīri u zikurudê is one construct chain.

Line 19: NU = ṣalmu, “image, figure.” MU = 1cs possessive suffix. Qabru, “grave,
tomb.” Šunullu (Š of nâlu), “to lay (someone or something) down.”
ṣalmīya ina qabrim ušnillū
Line 20: KUD = nakāsu “to fell, to cut down.” Izuzzu, “to stand, to serve.” The form is

Line 21: Šunu, “they” (3mp). Šarqiš, “secretly, by stealth.” īpušūni is a 3mp preterite
with 1cs suffix from epēšu. Lines 21 and 22 are formulated antithetically; they use the
same verb (epēšu) but antonymous adverbs (šarqiš, šūpîš).
šunu šarqiš īpušūni
Line 22: Šūpîš, “openly, publicly.” Eppussunūti is a 1cs durative with a 3mp accusative
suffix from epēšu. The š of the root and the š of the 3mp suffix (–šunūti) become –ss–.
anāku šūpîš eppussunūti
Line 23: DU 11 . GA = qibītu. Ṣīru, “exalted.” NU = lā. KÚR = nakāru, “to be(come) dif-
ferent, to change.” The form behind the logogram may be a G inf., for parallels to which,
see CAD N/1, 165, or a Dt durative, uttakkaru. Lines 23–24 form a frequent stock phrase,
used in pleas and at the end of prayers; see Mayer, UFBG, 303–4.
ina qibītīki ṣīrti ša lā nakāru
Line 24: Annu, “(word of) consent, approval.” Kīnu, “permanent, true, reliable.” BAL

durative, innennû.

Line 27: Aḫulap, “an exclamation used to express or to seek compassion” (CAD A/1,

transmitted rather consistently in the five MSS , though this is not the case for the second
half of the last line, in which also signs are missing in most exemplars. The text given here

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The supplicant in Ishtar 24 is not mentioned alone, but is involved in differ-
ent relations. As it is usual also in biblical psalms of individual lament, there is
an “I” (the supplicant), a “you” (the deity), and a “them” (a group of “others”).
The complaints can be directed in these three directions: they can be “I-
complaints” (see lines 12b, 13), “god-complaints” (not in Ishtar 24), or com-
plaints against the hostile group, here the sorcerer or sorceress (lines 15–20). 1 In
the Psalms, the hostile group consists usually of enemies, whose affronting acts
are the objects of complaints (see, e.g., Ps 13:5. 38:20–21) and whose threaten-
ing character can be compared to wild and deadly animals (see Ps 22:13–14, 17,
and 22). The general similarity has led to the interpretation that the enemies in
the Psalms are not only a structural parallel to the Mesopotamian sorcerers in
the three dimensions of relations in prayers, but that their evil actions are to be
interpreted as magical. 2 The prayer Ishtar 24 indicates that this interpretation is
at least not obvious. The eight lines dealing with the sorcerers (lines 15–22) and
already some passages in the earlier complaints show the well-developed Meso-
potamian terminology for witchcraft: besides the generic term kišpu (“witch-

craft”, line 17) and the related nouns kaššāpu and kaššaptu (“wizard / sorcerer”
and “witch / sorceress”, line 15), there are special terms for malevolent magical
practices: zikurudû (“cutting of life,” line 17), nakās napišti (“cutting the throat /
life,” line 20) and even the description of magical acts (the laying of figures of a
person in a grave as in line 19). There is also epēšu, a verb with special connota-
tions in magical contexts (lines 2, 14, and 22), which the supplicant uses for
their actions against the sorcerers (line 22). 3 The descriptions of the enemies in
the Psalms show no such specialized terminology but are much more ambiguous,
though the enemies still seem to be surrounded by a “demonic atmosphere.” 4

See the note on line 2. For the terminology, see Schwemer, Rituale, 1, n.2. The ritual in which
Ishtar 24 is embedded in at least three of the MSS aims at doing what the supplicant mentions in
line 22: the figure representing them is saved from the netherworld and cleaned, the figures
representing the sorcerer and sorceress are sent into the netherworld as their substitute; see
Schwemer, Abwehrzauber, 215–17.

An Incantation-Prayer: Nusku 12
D UANE S MITH
N USKU :
Nusku was the god of fire and lamp/torch light. Iconographically, he is rep-
resented by a lamp. In some texts, he is the son of Enlil, in others of Anu. At
Harran in northern Syria, where he seems to have had a cult center, he is the
son of Sin. 1 As Parpola suggests, 2 Nusku may have been worshiped as the god of
the crescent moon at some locations. At least at Harran, and perhaps elsewhere,
Nusku is associated with the moon. He has an important relationship with Sha-
mash. 3 As the present prayer indicates, he is the tappê Šamaš, “the companion of
Shamash.” While never among the most prominent Mesopotamian gods, Nusku
was venerated for a very long time, with evidence of his worship extending from
the Old Akkadian (2350–2120 BCE ) to the Hellenistic periods (330–30 BCE ). 4
There were two temples dedicated to him at Nippur. There were also shrines
dedicated to him at Babylon in the Marduk temple complex and at Dur Untash
(modern Chogha Zanbil) in Elam. Many of Nusku’s roles and traits are nearly
identical to those of Girra, also a god of fire (see page 145). Three of his roles
are particularly important in understanding the present prayer: a guardian of the
night, a courier of dreams, and, like Shamash, an anti-magician. 5 When called
upon, Nusku could reverse ominous portents or magical spells. The following
lines from Maqlû exemplify this role. 6

T HE P RAYER :
This prayer to Nusku is part of an apotropaic ritual whose purpose is to
provide relief from a dream with a possible bad portent. 7 The text introduces the
prayer with a simple indication of direct speech, umma šū-ma—in fact, this is
part of the ritual instructions. Unlike the common tri-partite structure of most
prayers, this prayer has two parts: an extremely short invocation and a compli-
cated petition, as the following indicates.
I) Invocation (lines 1–2a)
A) Name, relationship, and function
II) Petition (2b–11)
A) Plea for help (2b)
B) Nature of concern (2c–4)
1) Potential bad portents from a dream
2) Time of dream
3) Nature of knowledge of dream
a) The god’s
b) The supplicant’s
C) Request for remedy (5–7a)
1) In the case of a positive dream
2) In the case of a negative dream
a) Request that portent not be effective
b) Statement of disassociation
D) Ritual analogies and final petition (7b–11)

The prayer begins on line 3 of fragments K.3333+K.8583+Sm.1069, hereafter called MS A.

181
2) Like this hem
3) Final request
The prayer begins with an invocation that calls upon Nusku as judge and
companion of Shamash, the consummate judge, and asks that Nusku judge the
supplicant’s case. The petition begins by recounting a dream. The supplicant is
concerned about the portent of a dream that he had had the previous night. He
uses only an indefinite time formula, ina bararti qablīti šāt urri, to identify the
dream. The supplicant acknowledges that Nusku will certainly understand the
dream’s portent even if he does not. But there is a further concern. Not knowing
the portent of the dream, the supplicant does not know if it is for good or evil.
He asks Nusku to remove any evil portent while preserving benefits of any good
portent. But the major concern remains any potential negative consequence of
the dream. At this point, the supplicant asks that he be permanently dissociated
from the dream even to the point of asking that it not be his. The supplicant
then references the just completed ritual using its symbolic acts as analogies for
his requested dissociation from any evil portent of the dream. This rather convo-
luted sentence ties back to the opening of the petition by restating the time for-
mula. Finally, the prayer has the supplicant summarize the petition, “may it not
be mine.”
Although only fragmentary portions of the accompanying ritual are now ex-
tant, Butler was able to glean several important elements from these. In the por-
tion of the ritual just before the prayer, the supplicant’s hem is cut off and held
along with a reed(?) before a lamp, the symbol of Nusku. After the prayer is
spoken, it appears that the reed is snapped and wrapped(?) in the hem. Another
brief prayer follows. The ground is touched and the lamp lit. Finally, the suppli-
cant prays (again?) to his personal deities and to the lamp. 8
Oppenheim suggested the supplicant had forgotten the worrisome dream
but Butler argues, I think correctly, that it was the nature of the dream’s portent
that was unknown to the supplicant. 9 The portent may be good; but then again it
may be awful. The supplicant therefore seeks relief from any negative portent
without forfeiting any possible good that may come of it.
Even though he could find no physical join, Oppenheim 10 suggested as a
“working hypothesis” that the most complete witness to this prayer, MS A, be-
longed to Tablet I of the series Zīqīqu, the Assyrian Dream Book. He based his
suggestion on orthography and the double line column separator. Be this as it
may, there can be no doubt that our prayer is part of the same oneiromantic
tradition as Zīqīqu.

of the ritual portions of the tablets, most of it is unreadable. I therefore have not included it

Line 1: Umma šū-ma is not part of the prayer proper. Umma indicates the beginning of
direct discourse. Šū-ma refers to the person offering the prayer. The –ma tightly ties umma
šū to what follows . d PA . KU ( d PA - TÚG ) = the god Nusku. d UTU = the god Shamash (see page
197). Tappû, here in the acc., has a range of meanings from “business partner” to “neigh-
bor” to “companion” (see CAD T, 184–90). Syntactically, attā, “you,” belongs to the next
line.

Line 2: This line begins with three forms of dânu (diānum), “to judge,” that are part of
two separate but related clauses: dayyānāta, 2ms predicative; dīnu, “case, verdict, punish-
ment” or the like, with 1cs suffix; and dīn, G impv. This same three-word stock expression
occurs elsewhere with reference to other gods (see CAD D, 101). Of particular significance
is KAR 252 iii 4, which reads, Šamaš dayyānāta dīnī dīn, “Shamas, you are the judge. Judge
my case!” Nearly identical language is used of Girra in Maqlû II 69–90. See Oppenheim,
300, for a translation and discussion. See also Maqlû I 76, Nusku dayyānu, “Nusku is the
judge.” Such language is common with reference to Shamash and Adad but not so common
with Nusku. The two clauses and their use of the same root provide a transition from the
brief invocation to the petition. Nusku is a judge. Now it is time for him to judge the sup-
plicant’s case. MÁŠ . GE 6 = šuttu, “dream,” is accompanied by the demonstrative pronoun
annītu, “this.”

Line 3: The ša introduces a relative clause, whose verb is ibbablam-ma in line 4. The
clause further defines the dream. Barartu (barārītu), “evening watch.” Qablīti, “middle
(watch).” Šāt urri, “morning watch.” The line means little more than “some unknown time
during the night or early morning.”
ša ina bararti qablīti šāt urri
Line 4: Nabbulu (N of babālu, related to [w]abālu), “to be carried, to be brought.” The
ventive suffix on the verb prevents it from showing the subjunctive, which is expected in a
subordinate (relative) clause (see ša in line 3). The –ma is conjunctive. Because of the par-
allel with the first person form of idû, “to know,” in the second half of the line, there can
be little doubt that Ì . ZU = tīdû, “you know,” in the first half. IGI . ZU is a far more common
writing for this root. Ša attā tīdû anāku lā īdû is a version of a stock formula found in many
prayers. Butler argues that we would expect kullu ( DIB ) rather than idû if the supplicant
simply didn’t remember the dream (92). Although our text has the Sumerogram Ì . ZU for
tīdû, Ì . ZU can also stand, on occasion, for asû, “physician,” or even bārû, “diviner.” See CAD
A, 344 and B, 121 for examples. In light of this, one might consider the possibility of what
Scott Noegel calls a “visual (purely based on orthography)” as opposed to an “oral (based
only on sound)” pun between Ì . ZU and īdû (see his Nocturnal Ciphers: The Allusive Language
of Dreams in the Ancient Near East [New Haven: American Oriental Society, 2007], 1, n.2).
If such a pun were involved, the orthography, but not the pronunciation, would further
contrast Nusku’s knowledge ( Ì . ZU ) with the supplicant’s lack of knowledge (lā īdû) and
simultaneously imply extending Nusku’s range of knowledge to include healing and divi-
nation.
ibbablam-ma ša attā tīdû anāku lā īdû
Line 5: damqat is from damāqu, “to be(come) good.” In dreams and omens, dumqu,
(dumuq is the bound form) means “favorable interpretation”; see CAD D, 180–81. The
writing a-a = ayy-, “may it not,” is the vetitive prefix, which indicates a negative wish.
Šêṭu here, as in other prayers and curses, means “to leave, to bypass, to escape (me)” (see
CAD Š/2, 344).
šumma damqat dumuqša ayy-išīṭanni
Line 6: ḪUL = lemnet, a 3fs predicative from lemēnu, “to be(come) bad,” parallel to
damqat in line 7. ḪUL -šá = lumun-ša = lumušša, “its evil.” Kašādu, “to reach, to arrive.”
Kašādu is often associated with the arrival of diseases and other misfortunes, including
death; see CAD K, 278.

Line 7: Yattun, “mine,” is a fs form of yā’u (see also line 11). Alan Lenzi discusses
lines 6–12—specifically the phrase lā yattun šī here and in line 12—in the context of the
stock expression šiptu ul ya/uttun, “the incantation is not mine.” Notice that in our text the
stock phrase has been turned into a wish, a subjunctive as indicated by lā rather than its
more common indicative mood with ul (“Siptu ul Yuttun: Some Reflections On A Closing
Formula In Akkadian Incantations,” in Gazing on the Deep: Ancient Near Eastern and Other
Studies in Honor of Tzvi Abusch [ed. Jeffrey Stackert, Barbara Nevling Porter, and David P.
Wright; Bethesda: CDL Press, 2010], 131–66, here 161). The word kīma, “as, like,” intro-
duces the first ritual analogy of the prayer. GI = qanû, “reed.” Naṭpu, “torn out,” is a ver-
bal adjective from naṭāpu, “to tear out, to uproot” (see CAD N/2, 128) with a subjunctive
(–u) suffix. Kīma marks the beginning of a very long, complex sentence with several subor-
dinate clauses (and even a subordinate clause within a clause). The subject of the sentence
is in line 9b (lumun šutti) and its verb is in line 11 (ayy-ikšudanni).
lā yattun šī kīma qanû annû naṭpū-ma
Line 8: MS A reads ana KI -šú but MS B reads ana ni-iṭ-pi-šú, “to its place of plucking.” KI
= ašru, “place.” Ana ašrīšu generally means “(to be restored) to its place.” NU = lā. GUR
( MS A’s reading) = iturru, a G preterite with subjunctive –u, from târu, “to turn, to return.”
MS B confirms this reading with i-tu-[ru . . . ]. The first partially readable line of the ritual
preceding the prayer mentions qan kiṣri, “a reed joint” (see Butler, 314, line 1). Unfortu-
nately, the associated verb is unclear. The kīma in this line begins a second ritual analogy.
TÚG . SÍG = sissiktu, “hem, fringe, edge.” See CAD S, 322–25 for the most common defini-
tions of sissiktu. Meir Mallul suggested that a sissiktu is “some type of loincloth or lap-
garment” (“‘Sissiktu’ and ‘sikku’ Cutting Off a sissiktu - Their Meaning and Function,” BiOr
43.1/2 [1986], 20–36, here 36). See the further discussion of sissiktu in the note on line 15
of Shamash 25, page 426. The impression of a sissiktu could serve in lieu of a seal (CAD S,
322–25). TÚG = ṣubātu, “garment.” Batāqu, “to cut off.” MS B preserves the expected sub-
junctive on the 3fs predicative verb (batqatu). This second ritual analogy may reflect the
cutting (batāqu) of a sissiktu as a symbolic act of divorce just as tying (rakāsu) a sissiktu was
a symbolic act of marriage (see CAD S, 322). The supplicant seeks to symbolically divorce
himself from any negative portent of his dream.
ana ašrīšu (var. niṭpīšu) lā iturru kīma sissiktu annītu ina ṣubātīya batqat(u)-ma
Line 9: MS A inserts the word ḫepî, “broken,” between TÚG and GIM , indicating that
there were unreadable signs in this place in the text (somewhere in the ancestry of MS A)
due to a broken or defaced tablet. Ḫepî is the common scribal method of indicating such a
break. MS B, however, reads TÚG -ia at this location. GIM = kīma, here means “because” or
the like and introduces a subordinate clause within the larger subordinate clause. Ibbatqu,
“it was torn,” is an N preterite of batāqu (with subjunctive). MS B varies, reading a G pret-
erite (with subjunctive): ibtuqu, “he tore (it).” The image of the torn hem reflects the ritual
requirement to “cut off (batāqu) the hem of the right side of his (garment)” in the ritual𒑆 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : N USKU 12

instructions immediately before the prayer (Butler, 314; Oppenheim, 289, 340). The last
few words of the line form the subject of the independent clause, upon which the preced-
ing lines (7b–9a) depend.
ana ṣubātīya kīma ibbatqū-ma lā iturru lumun šutti annīti
Line 10: Assuming that the end of this line is correctly restored, line 10 is identical to
line 3 plus the first word in line 4. As there, these words form a relative clause that further
defines the dream. This restatement together with the final plea provides a summary
statement of the long plea that precedes it. As such, it produces an emphasized sense of
urgency.
ša ina bararti qablīti šāt urri ibbablam-ma
Line 11: Ayy-ikšudanni is the main verb of the long sentence that started in line 7b. MS
A lacks this verb and instead understands the final clause of the line to be the main sen-
tence. According to MS A, everything preceding lā yattun šī all the way back to the kīma in
line 7b must be read as an anacoluthon. This final clause is identical to the first clause in
line 7, thereby framing (in MS B) the ritual analogies and final petition. Here the prayer
proper apparently ends. The rest of the ritual is rather broken (see the introduction to the
prayer above).

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In 1873, Sayce tentatively suggested that biblical Nisroch (‫נסרך‬, 2 Kgs 19:37
 Isa 37:38) might be none other than the god Nusku. Since then, this view has
come in and out of currency but has never gained permanent traction. At the
very best, the evidence is weak and dependent on unsupportable assumptions
about a number of modifications and/or errors in the way Hebrew scribes wrote
and preserved the name. These unsupportable assumptions render the suggestion
unlikely if not impossible. Uehlinger outlines the several problems with the sug-
gestion. 1
Nusku as the lamp that lights the darkness is not mentioned in this Akkadi-
an prayer, though the ritual implies this role for the deity. The prayer-hymn of
David in 2 Sam 22, especially ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫יהּ‬ ַ ‫גּ‬ ִ ַ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫יהֹו‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫יר‬ ִ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫ה‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫י־א‬
‫כּ‬ ִ , “You, O Yahweh, are
my lamp; Yahweh lights my darkness” (v 29), attributes a similar role to Yah-
weh.
One of the obvious elements of this Akkadian prayer is that the supplicant
does not know the meaning of his dream. In contrast is the story of Joseph in
1
A. H. Sayce, “Critical Examination of Isaiah xxxvi.–xxxix. on the Basis of Recent Assyrian Dis-
coveries,” Theological Review 10, issue 40 (1873), 15–31, here 27; note Christoph Uehlinger,
“Nisroch,” DDD, 630–32.186Gen 37 where both Joseph and his brothers know the meanings of his dreams
and know them without the aid of professional oneiromancy. One sees the same
with Daniel’s dreams. In general, biblical actors understand their dreams with-
out professional assistance. Among the very few exceptions are foreigners, Phar-
aoh and Nebuchadnezzar, for example. 2 This Nusku prayer and its ritual do not
appear to comprehend the possibility that a dream might be meaningless—a
possibility suggested by Job 20:8 and Isa 29:7–8. 3
Discussed more fully in connection with one of the prayers to Shamash, 4 the
role of the gods, particularly Shamash and Adad and less frequently Nusku, as
judges is important in several prayers. Compare the role of Yahweh as judge in
Gen 18:25, Job 21:22, Pss 7:9, 43:1, 50:6, 82:1, 3, 8, and elsewhere. The Akka-
dian stock phrase dīnī dīn, “judge my case,” in line 2, finds an extremely close
semantic equivalent in ‫י‬ ‫ט‬ ִ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ‫ט‬ ָ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ , “judge my case,” in Lam 3:59b.
Cutting off the hem of a garment as a metaphor for an act that cannot be
undone is reminiscent of David’s cutting off of Saul’s ‫יל‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫מּ‬ ַ ‫ף־ה‬
ַ‫נ‬ ‫כּ‬ ְ , “corner of the
cloak,” in 1 Sam 24:5, an act of humiliation. By tearing off the hem of his own
garment, our supplement humbles himself while at the same time provides a
symbol of the desire for a permanent “divorce,” or separation, from any evil
portent of his dream. Compare also 1 Sam 15:27, where Saul tears off Samuel’s
‫יל‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫מּ‬ ַ ‫ף־ה‬
ַ‫נ‬ ‫כּ‬ ְ as a symbol of the transfer of kingship.
The Biblical tradition does not share the concern expressed in the Nusku
prayer that a dream’s significance could be ambiguous. 5 The closest parallel to
this prayer within the extended Jewish tradition comes from the Babylonian
Talmud rather than the Hebrew Bible. Ber 55b 6 records a prayer containing simi-
lar themes to some of those found in our Nusku prayer.
Sovereign of the Universe, I am Thine and my dreams are Thine. I have dreamt a
dream and I do not know what it is. Whether I have dreamt about myself or my
companions have dreamt about me, or I have dreamt about others, if they are

In fact, biblical authors show a strong tendency to distrust diviners. In places there is great
concern that diviners might be the source of false prophecy. See Deut 13:2–6, where we see the
concern that, even if the portent comes true, such diviners may lead to the worship of other
gods. Deut 18:21–22 claims that an oracle that does not come true is a sure indication that it is
not from Yahweh.

Epstein’s translation. This parallel was first noted by Oppenheim, 299. Devorah Schoenfeld
discusses this prayer/ritual as evidence for an “incomplete transition” from a revelation to inter-
pretation based religion (see “Madness and Prophecy: Dreams, Texts, and the Power of Rabbinic
Interpretation,” Pastoral Psychology 56:2 [Nov, 2007], 223–35).𒑆 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER : N USKU 12

good dreams, confirm them and reinforce them like the dreams of Joseph, and if
they require a remedy, heal them, as the waters of Marah were healed by Moses,
our teacher, and as Miriam was healed of her leprosy and Hezekiah of his sick-
ness, and the waters of Jericho by Elisha. As thou didst turn the curse of the
wicked Balaam into a blessing, so turn all my dreams into something good for
me. [References omitted]
The prayer is attributed to Amemar II (c. 400 CE ), Mar Zutra, or R. Ashi (most
likely Amemar). This prayer answered a challenge to tell something the other
members of the group might not know. Note the uncertainty as to the portent of
the reported dream in both the Talmudic prayer and our Nusku prayer. Both also
desire that the portent of their dreams be upheld if good but avoided if bad.

An Incantation-Prayer to the Cultic Agent Salt
J EFFREY S TACKERT
S ALT :
There is little evidence from ancient Mesopotamia for the deification of salt.
The ruler of the Middle Euphrates kingdom of Mari, Zimri-Lim, did erect a statue
to Ḫatta, the god of salt, 1 but it does not seem that such veneration of a salt god
was widespread or persistent. Salt was employed widely in the ancient Near East
for various utilitarian purposes (e.g., curing hides, preservation, flavor en-
hancement, and medicine). It was also a regular ingredient in ritual and magical
practices. 2 For example, by analogy to its use at the human table, Mesopotamian
texts describe the application of salt to animal and vegetable offerings. It is also
employed in incense offerings, various magical rites, and ritual curses. The anal-
ogies of Mesopotamian omen literature likewise reference salt. Among Hittite
rituals, perhaps the best known use of salt is one that parallels its use in Mesopo-
tamian curses: the First Hittite Soldier’s Oath employs salt within an analogical
curse ritual against that soldier who would commit sedition. 3
The ancient Near Eastern ritual applications for salt indicate that it carries
both positive and negative significances. It can symbolize health, purification,
and well-being, but it can also be associated with infertility, dissolution, and
destruction. Salt is also employed ritually across the gamut of social ranks.

It is oftentimes difficult to draw a meaningful distinction between medicine and magic. For
discussions of these categories and their relationship, see, e.g., Jean Bottéro, “Magic and Medi-
cine,” in Everyday Life in Ancient Mesopotamia (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001),
162–82; Walter Farber, “Witchcraft, Magic, and Divination in Ancient Mesopotamia,” CANE

Treating Ghost-Induced Illnesses in Ancient Mesopotamia [Ancient Magic and Divination 3; Leiden:
Brill/Styx, 2006], 67–71), as well as her texts nos. 60 and 191a for examples of the magico-
medical usage of salt in Mesopotamia.

189190T HE P RAYER :
The salt incantation-prayer appears in Tablet VI (lines 111–119) of the eight
tablet series known as Maqlû (“burning”). The canonical form of Maqlû dates
from the first millennium BCE and constitutes a complex ritual ceremony for
counteracting sorcery and effecting retribution against the witch(es) or war-
lock(s) who has (have) unjustly afflicted an innocent target. The salt incantation-
prayer is one of several incantations to be recited by a victim of black magic
and, according to the ritual tablet that accompanies the series, is to be attended
by a fumigation rite. 4 The prayer is characterized by a tripartite structure: hym-
nic introduction, petition, and promise of praise in response to divine assistance.
The first four lines comprise the hymnic introduction with stereotypical acclaim
of the addressee. Lines 5–8a comprise the entreaty to remove the witchcraft that
afflicts the speaker. Lines 8b–9 contain the concluding promise to praise salt
upon its successful intervention on the petitioner’s behalf.
Because it does not address a deity, the salt incantation-prayer is not a con-
ventional example of the shuilla. It instead belongs to a relatively small sub-
category of texts termed Kultmittelbeschwörungen or Kultmittelgebete (“incanta-
tions/prayers to a cultic agent”). 5 Much like shuillas directed to particular dei-
ties, incantation-prayers to cultic agents attempt to exploit specific characteris-
tics of their addressees to remedy the patient’s predicament.
The speaker’s predicament in the salt incantation-prayer appears to be two-
fold. What is obvious is that the supplicant suffers the ill effects of witchcraft.
Yet several factors suggest that the situation in this case is more complex. First,
this text’s promise of praise contains two significant features that point to a rich-
er religious conceptualization of the speaker’s predicament: (1) The speaker
draws an analogy between their action and the action taken toward “the god
who made me,” i.e., the personal god; and (2) The promise to praise employs the
iterative stem of the verb (lultammarki), a unique usage among the shuilla-type
incantation-prayers that address non-deified objects. Second, the progression of
ritual applications for salt envisioned in this incantation-prayer (flavor enhancer
for food offerings, incense additive, and finally fumigation additive) may reflect
a progression of ritual activities performed by the speaker to counteract misfor-
tune. This precise sequence is attested in Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 1–22. 6 This passage
in Ludlul explicitly describes divine abandonment and its effects, a recurrent
4
The ritual (Ritual Tablet [IX] 118–120) reads: šiptu attī ṭābtu ša ina ašri elli ibbanû / ana muḫḫi
kīrban ṭābti tamannū-ma / ina muḫḫi nignakki ša qutāri ša ina rēš mayyāli tašakkan, “The incanta-
tion ‘You are salt, the one made in a pure place’ you shall recite over a lump of salt and you shall
place (it) (i.e., the salt) in the fumigant burner that is at the head of the bed (i.e., of the pa-
tient).” See Meier’s edition (61).

topic in Maqlû (e.g., I 1–14). 7 Taken together, these factors suggest that the salt
incantation-prayer provides a remedy not only for the witchcraft that afflicts the
supplicant but also the abandonment of the personal god, a departure effected
by the afflicting spell. 8

ÉN at-ti MUN šá

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This term marks the beginning of
the prayer but is not part of its text. It is characteristic of ritual texts more broadly and is
thus not limited to prayers per se. Attī, “you” (fs). MUN = ṭābtu, “salt.” Ašru, “place.” KÙ =
ellu, “pure, clean.” Nabnû (N of banû), “to be built, to be made.” The form is a 3cs preterite
with subordination marker. Ša ina ašri elli ibbanû: this terminology parallels that used to
describe the production of divine images in Mesopotamia (see Christopher Walker and
Michael B. Dick, “The Induction of the Cult Image in Ancient Mesopotamia: The Mesopo-
tamian mīs pî Ritual,” in Born in Heaven, Made on Earth: The Making of the Cult Image in the
Ancient Near East, [ed. Michael B. Dick; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1999], 55–122).

Line 2: mākālû, “food, meal,” oftentimes used to characterize food offerings to deities.
= ilū, “gods.” GAL . MEŠ = rabûtu, “great.” The “great gods” can refer to the gods
in general or to the chief deities of the pantheon. In light of the parallelism with Ellil (=
d
EN . LÍL ), the lauditory tone of the invocation, and especially the banquet described in the
following line, the great gods here are likely the principle deities. Šâmu (šiāmu), “to ap-
point”. The 2fs accusative suffix on the verb refers to ṭābtu, “salt” in line 1. Among its
various usages, the verb šâmu may denote the assignment of roles and offices to deities,
including by Ellil (see CAD Š/I, 358–59). Ellil, “lord [of the] wind,” is the high god who
resides in the temple é-kur, “mountain house” (see line 3), in Nippur.
ana mākālê ilī rabûti išīmki Ellil
DINGIR . MEŠ
Line 3: Ina balī-X, “without X.” Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be set, to be established.”
Iššakkan is an N 3cs durative. Naptanu, “meal, (royal/cultic) banquet.” Naptan may be read
as the absolute form of the noun. Yet there seems to be little significance to the absence of
the case ending here. Maqlû II 9–10, which is a near verbatim parallel to lines 3–4 here,
attests two variants: naptanu and naptana. These examples suggest the possibility of read-
ing the TAN sign here as a CVCV sign (i.e., tana) rather than a CVC sign. Alternatively, the
case ending could simply be implied. It must also be noted that, as a first millennium As-
syrian text, such omission of the case vowel is hardly anomalous.
ina balīki ul iššakkan naptan ina E-kur
Line 4: LUGAL = šarru, “king.” IDIM = kabtu, “noble, influential person.” NUN = rubû,
“prince, nobleman.” The quartet of god, king, noble, and prince recurs in Mesopotamian
prayers and incantations as a formulaic expression to denote those to whom the speaker is
subordinate. Eṣēnu, “to smell.” Qutrinnu, “incense.” Incense offerings oftentimes appear
alongside food offerings. The claim of this line is also applied elsewhere to deities, again
underscoring the conceit of addressing the non-deity salt in a shuilla-type prayer.
ina balīki ilu šarru kabtu u rubû ul iṣṣinū qutrinnu
Line 5: This line begins with a standard self-introduction formula. The remainder of
line 5 through the end of line 6 constitutes a sort of complaint, informing the addressee of
the supplicant’s condition. Complaints frequently follow the self-introduction. NENNI =
annanna, “so and so.” Annanna serves as a place marker for the name and patronymic of
the petitioner who employs the stock prayer. A = māru, “son.” Kišpū, “sorcery, witchcraft.”
Ṣubbutu (D of ṣabātu), “to sieze.” Ṣubbutūʾinni is a D 3mp “active stative” (or “transitive
parsāku”; see Heuhnergard § 33.2) plus 1cs accusative suffix. It is formally identical to the
predicative construction. One might expect the accusative to be –ninni, but the form with-
out the initial n is often found in SB Akkadian (see GAG §84d and Verbalparadigma 12a,
n.6 on p. 11*). The alef placed after the verb and before the pronominal suffix convention-𒌋 A N I NCANTATION -P RAYER TO THE C ULTIC A GENT S ALT

Line 6: Upšāšû (upšaššû), “magical intrigues, sorcery.” Laʾābu, “to afflict.” Leʾbūʾinni is
a G 3mp active stative or transitive parsāku construction plus 1cs accusative suffix. Line 6
is subordinate to the ša in line 5; thus, upšāšê leʾbūʾinni is in apposition to kišpī ṣubbutūʾinni.
upšāšê leʾbūʾinni
Line 7: BÚR = paṭāru, “to release, to loosen.” Puṭrī is a G fs impv. Puššuru (D of
pašāru), “to dispel, to disperse, to release.” Pušširī is a D fs impv. Ruḫû, “sorcery, witch-
craft.” The petition proper begins in this line. Note also that alongside the petition itself is
a renewed invocation of salt. The verbs paṭāru and pašāru are common in incantations
against sorcery and their accompanying rituals. As attested in the accompanying ritual to
this text, release is attempted in this case through the recitation of the salt incantation-
prayer as a part of a fumigation rite that features a lump of salt. In other instances in
Maqlû, the afflicted patient burns an effigy of the witch and warlock responsible for their
torment (e.g., I 135–143). In some cases, the incantation texts portray witchcraft as physi-
cally binding the patient, and various metaphors for release dramatize the victim’s libera-
tion. See, e.g., Maqlû V 51ff., 95–97, which characterize witchcraft as a binding to be bro-
ken, peeled like garlic, and released like a string.
puṭrī kišpīya ṭābtu pušširī ruḫêya
Line 8: Maḫāru, “to receive, take upon oneself.” Muḫrīnnī-ma is a G fs impv. plus 1cs
accusative suffix and enclitic –ma. GIM = kīma, “like, as.” Banû, “to build, make.” Bānīya is
a G ms participle (genitive case) with a 1cs possessive suffix. It is functioning attributively
in relation to ili, “god.” “The god who made me” is an epithet for the personal god. Other
similar epithets for the personal god include “the god who guards you” (ilu nāṣirka), “the
god who provides good health” (ilu mušallimu), and “the god at my side” (ila aḫīya). For
references to these different epithets, see CAD I/J, 100. For discussion of the personal god,
see page 431 in this book. Note that kīma ili bānīya should be read syntactically with the
verb in line 9.
upšāšê muḫrīnnī-ma kīma ili bānīya
Line 9: Šamāru, “to praise.” Lultammarki is a Gtn 1cs precative plus 2fs suffix (–št–
often becomes –lt– in SB Akkadian texts). Across literary genres, šamāru appears primarily
in the Gt stem, which has led to some debate over the productivity of the iterative stem for
this verb. Mayer, however, does take šamāru as Gtn here (UFBG, 323). It should also be
noted that the promise of praise that closes the shuilla-type incantation-prayer is at times
accompanied by modifiers such as ana dārâti “forever,” which is conceptually parallel to
the iterative aspect of the Akkadian –tan– stems. For examples of the uses of šamāru in the194closing formulae of Mesopotamian prayers, see UFBG, 323–24. For discussion of the clos-
ing promise in shuilla-prayers, see Abusch, “Promise to Praise” as well as his “Blessing and
Praise in Ancient Mesopotamian Incantations,” in Literatur, Politik und Recht in Mesopota-

ca et Christiana 14; Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003), 1–14.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Though there are no prayers addressed to cultic agents in the Hebrew Bible,
there are still important resonances between this prayer and religious phenome-
na from ancient Israel and Judah. The various uses for salt attested across the
ancient Near East correspond closely with those described in the Hebrew Bible.
For example, biblical texts reference salt as a flavor enhancer (Job 6:6, Ezra
4:14, 6:9) and medicine (Ezek 16:4). Priestly sacrificial rules require the applica-
tion of salt to food offerings presented to the deity (Lev 2:13, Num 18:19, Ezek
43:24). Salt is also added to biblical incense offerings (Exod 30:35), employed as
a healing agent in prophetic magic (2 Kgs 2:20–22), and dispersed as part of
cursing rituals (Deut 29:20–26). 1
The conceptualization of sacrifice as the food meant to solicit divine favor is
especially prominent in the opening address of this prayer. Within the Hebrew
Bible, a similar view obtains (see, e.g., Lev 3:11, 16; 21:6, 8, 17, 21, 22; 22:25;
Num 28:2, 24; Ezek 44:7, 16; Mal 1:6–12), although there is also some attempt
to rebut this conception of sacrifice (e.g., Ps 50:12–13). In the case of Ps 50, by
offering a polemic against sacrifice as divine food, the psalmist reinforces the
normative status of this understanding. 2
1
The relation between salt and curse—and by extension, salt and covenant—has been explored
extensively within biblical studies. See, e.g., F. Charles Fensham, “Salt as Curse in the Old Tes-
tament and the Ancient Near East,” BA 25 (1962), 48–50; H. Eising, “   ,” TDOT 8:331–33 (at
333). For broader connections between salt and covenant and especially sacrificial aspects, see
Baruch A. Levine, Leviticus (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of
America, 1989), 13; Idem, Numbers 1–20 (AB 4; New York: Doubleday, 1993), 449; and Jacob
Milgrom, Leviticus 1–16 (AB 3; New York: Doubleday, 1991), 191–92.

alia, W. G. Lambert, “Donations of Food and Drink to the Gods in Ancient Mesopotamia,” in

The conception of the personal god as the individual’s creator finds a close
parallel in biblical texts such as Isa 44:2 ( ָ‫ךּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ע‬ ְ ַ‫י‬ ‫ן‬ ‫ט‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ֶ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ָך‬ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫ֹצ‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ָך‬ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ֶ ‫ע‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ , “the L ORD ,
your maker and creator, who has helped you from the womb”), Prov 14:31 ( ‫ק‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֵ ‫ע‬
‫ֺן‬ ‫יו‬ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫ן‬ ֵ‫חֹנ‬ ‫דוֹ‬ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫וּמ‬

but he who is gracious to the needy honors him”; see Prov 17:5), and Job 35:10
( ‫ה‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ְ‫י‬ ָ‫לּ‬ ‫בּ‬ ַ ‫רוֹת‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ן‬ ‫ֹת‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ ‫י‬ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ָ ‫ע‬ ‫לוֹהּ‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ֵ‫יּ‬ ‫א‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ֹא‬ ‫ל‬ ְ‫ו‬ , “But no one says, ‘Where is God, my maker,
the one who gives songs in the night?’”). The Second Isaiah text cited here is
also noteworthy because it applies the intimate epithets of the personal god,
with singular possessives, to the collective exilic community (see also Isa 45:9,
11; 46:4; 51:13; Hos 8:4; Ps 95:6; 149:2).
As for the promise of praise, texts such as Ps 44:9, 115:18, 119:64, and
145:2 emphasize iterative praise of the deity akin to the promise in this prayer.

A Ritual and Incantation-Prayer
against Ghost-Induced Illness: Shamash 73
D UANE S MITH
S HAMASH :
For the ancient Mesopotamians, Shamash (Akk.) or Utu (Sum.) was the dei-
fied sun. 1 He brought light and warmth to the world and its inhabitants during
the day. It was in this capacity that Shamash brought life to the world and
caused plants to grow. At night, he surveyed the underworld. While the serrated
blade, sometimes called a saw, commonly appears in depictions of Shamash, the
winged solar disk is his most common iconographic symbol. 2 His anthropo-
morphic image is that of a bearded old man, sometimes seated, often with solar
rays emanating from his shoulders and holding a scepter and/or his serrated
blade. 3 His divine number is 20. Shamash, the twin brother of the goddess Ishtar
(Inana), was the son of Sin (Nanna). His mother is Ningal and his consort is Aya.
1
It is often difficult to conceptualize the relationship between the nature of the astrological gods
as divine beings and their nature as the celestial bodies with which the ancients identified them.
For many of them, including Shamash, this conceptual difficulty extends to them having an
anthropomorphic representation while at the same time being associated with a celestial body.
On these difficulties see JoAnn Scurlock, Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-induced Illnesses
in Ancient Mesopotamia (Ancient Magic and Divination 3; Leiden: Brill, 2006), 77 and her several
references. The prayer discussed here well illustrates this point in lines 21–25 as does line 3 of
Shamash 1 (see page 370).

197198Archaeologists have uncovered temples for Shamash at Sippar and at Larsa, both
named É-babbar, “shining house.” He also shared a temple with Sin at Ashur.
While the importance of Utu/Shamash waxed and waned over time, 4 Sumerian
and Akkadian texts give witness to his worship from the earliest times until late
in the history of Mesopotamia.
Because Shamash could survey the earth by day and the underworld by
night—and therefore nothing could remain hidden from him, he was revered as
the god of truth and justice, who corrected injustice and mitigated the portents
of evil omens. 5 In the epilogue of the Code of Hammurabi, for example, Shamash
is called dayyānim rabîm ša šamê u erṣetim (xxiv 85–86), “the great judge of
heaven and earth.” The bas-relief on the upper part of the Code’s stele depicts
Hammurabi before Shamash. The attribution of law and justice to Shamash ap-
peared long before Hammurabi. The epilogue to the Laws of Lipit-Ishtar, c. 1939
BCE , reads in part, “in accordance with the true word of the god Utu, I made the
lands of Sumer and Akkad hold fair judicial procedure.” 6
Ancient texts compare the kings Ur-Nammu, Amar-Sin, Lipit-Ishtar, Ham-
murabi, and Zimri-Lim to Utu/Shamash. 7 He was the protector of several heroes
including Gilgamesh. 8 More than many other gods, Shamash involved himself
positively in the affairs of humans, in which he seemed to have considerable
interest.

duplicate, Sm.1118, in his treatment of this ritual in his forthcoming book, Der König im Gefäng-
nis und das Neujahrsfest im Herbst: Mechanismen der Legitimation des babylonischen Herrschers im 1.
Jahrtausend v. Chr. und ihre Geschichte (Habilitation, Heidelberg, 2010; rev. forthcoming). This

by an eṭemmu (“ghost”), an evil alû-demon, or a mukīl rēš lemutti-demon. The
text, at the highest level, has the structure of a conditional instruction. The ritual
functions as an extended apodosis addressing the condition in the brief protasis.
The ritual includes various ritual preparations and a performance of two incan-
tation-prayers, one by an āšipu, “exorcist,” and the other, Shamash 73, by the
marṣu, “diseased person, patient.” Although the second prayer is our focus, the
full ritual instructions are included here.
The conditional instruction structure is a common feature of most Mesopo-
tamian “magico-medical” texts. 10 As with many other ancient Mesopotamian
rituals designed to treat ghost-induced diseases, this ritual seeks to transfer the
offending ghost from the infected person to a specially prepared figurine and
then to bury that figurine along with the ghost it now embodies in an appropri-
ate place.
The ritual begins by providing rather specific instructions to the practitioner
who is addressed in the second person: “you gather. . . .” Nowhere does the text
clearly provide a title for this second person practitioner. Line 11 introduces an
āšipu in the third person: “He places. . . .” This āšipu performs a short but poign-
ant incantation. In line 17, the text returns to the second person, “you set up,”
and provides further instructions, presumably to the practitioner of the first six-
teen lines. Is the practitioner that the text addresses in the second person also
the third person āšipu of lines 11–16? It is not possible to be certain. JoAnn
Scurlock argues that they are the same person. Texts of this broad type that
specify the participants generally mention only an āšipu and a marṣu. 11 However,
three related texts indicate the participation of āšipu and asû, “physician,” as
practitioners in rituals intended to cure a person of a ghost-induced disease. If
there is only one practitioner in our text, the shift from second person to third
person and back to second person may indicate that the text is composite. As we
will see, there are other possible indications that this ritual was stitched together
from various loosely-related or previously-unrelated sources.
The conditional instruction begins with a protasis listing illness sources for
which the following ritual, the apodosis or the instruction, is prescribed. The
practitioner is to construct a figurine and outfit it with various attire and provi-
sions. This figurine is placed on the roof of the patient’s house and libated with a
mixture of grain flour mixed into water and beer. Slivers of cedar and a magic
new tablet provides an important duplicate to the ritual instructions. Reference to these witness-
es will be noted occasionally as seems necessary.
10
“Magico-medical” is adopted from Scurlock’s Magico-Medical Means of Treating Ghost-Induced
Illnesses in Ancient Mesopotamia, in which she studies over three hundred texts dealing with vari-
ous ghost-induced illnesses.
11
JoAnn Scurlock, “Physician, Exorcist, Conjurer, Magician: The Tale of Two Healing Profes-
sions,” in Mesopotamian Magic: Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspectives (ed. Tzvi Abusch
and Karel van der Toorn; Ancient Magic and Divination 1; Groningen: Styx, 1999), 69–79, here
more specifically 70–71 and 75.200circle are placed around it. The practitioner then covers the figurine with an
unfired fermenting vat. For three days and nights, the covered figurine is to be
left outdoors while an exorcist (āšipu) places loaves and juniper censers by day
(ana pāni Šamaš) and pours out emmer flour by night (ana pāni kakkabī mūšītim).
Day and night, the exorcist recites a short incantation directed at the ghost. In
the evening of the third day, the practitioner must prepare a ritual before Sha-
mash. The patient then raises the figurine and recites the incantation that is the
principle subject of this treatment. Following this incantation, the practitioner
must place the figurine in a pot and bind it by an oath. The ritual ends with the
instructions to “bury it in abandoned wastelands.”
Under the guidance and instruction of the practitioner (kīam tušadbabšu,
“you shall make him recite as follows”), the patient recites the longest incanta-
tion-prayer of the ritual, Shamash 73. One of the textual witnesses to the prayer
lacks any associated ritual (Scurlock’s MS C). The existence of this tablet suggests
that the prayer circulated independently of the ghost ritual. For this reason, it is
possible that a compiler simply plugged the prayer into the ritual. This may ac-
count for the apparent differences between the description of the disease in the
protasis of the ritual (“ghost,” “an evil alû-demon or a mukīl rēš lemutti-demon”)
and the description in lines 29 and 30 of the prayer (“an utukku-demon, a rābiṣu
demon, a ghost, a lilû-demon, paralysis, dizziness, numbness of the flesh, vertigo,
stiffness, [and] confusion”). Only eṭemmu, “ghost,” is common between them.
The structure of the prayer is as follows:
I) Invocation
A) The god’s name and honorific titles (19–22)
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (23–27a)
II) Petition
A) Self-introduction (27b)
B) Acknowledgement of reverential stance vis-a-vis the god (27c)
C) Lament (28–30)
D) Plea (31–34a)
III) Conditional call for agreement and rejoicing (34b–35)
The invocation first calls on Shamash by name and by several of his honorif-
ic titles. These highlight his role among the gods and among people. It then
praises his various talents. He is judge, bringer of light and warmth to all hu-
mankind and even to the animals. The invocation takes up the important theme
of judge a second time. Here the supplicant reminds Shamash that he makes
right the verdicts of the wronged man and woman. The invocation thus sets the
stage for the petition. The petition itself begins with a common formulaic self-
introduction that leads directly to a lament in which the supplicant recounts
their condition: exhausted and bound (iʾiltu iʾʾilanni, “a binding has bound me”)
by an angry god or goddess. Here, with reference to ritual behavior, the suppli-
cant indicates that they are standing before Shamash. The prayer unfolds the
details of how they are bound. At this point, the plea, returning to the theme of
Shamash as judge, calls on Shamash to render a verdict in the supplicant’s case𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 201
and to do it without delay. Referring back to binding, the prayer asks that Sha-
mash not take up any other case until the supplicant’s binding (iʾiltī, “my bind-
ing”) is released. With the repetition of similar language, the prayer closely ties
the lament and plea together. The prayer ends by calling on the gods to agree
with Shamash’s verdict and for both the heavens and the earth to celebrate his
granting of the supplicant’s plea.

Line 1: DIŠ = šumma, “if.” NA = amīlu (awīlum), “man.” Magico-medical texts often
open with the words šumma amīlu. Amīlu is the antecedent to the pronominal suffix on the
verb (–šu). GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost.” See JoAnn Scurlock and Burton R. Andersen, Diagno-
ses in Assyrian and Babylonian Medicine: Ancient Sources, Translations, and Modern Medical
Analyses (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2005), 436–37, 441, 455–56 on eṭemmu as a
disease symptom. DAB = ṣabātu, “seize, take hold.” Note that –tš– (the last radical of the
root and the first letter of the pronominal suffix) becomes –ss–. The –ma serves here as a
conjunctive particle. UŠ = redû, “to accompany, pursue” In this case the MEŠ indicates an
iterative form of the verb, the Gtn: riteddû, “to pursue, to chase constantly.” Lū . . . lū,
“either . . . or.” A . LÁ = alû, a kind of demon. ḪUL = lemnu, “evil,” is an adj. that modifies
alû. The reconstruction of the last three words of the line follows the new duplicate
Sm.1118.

Line 2: SAG .< ḪUL >. ḪA . ZA = sagḫulḫazû-demon or mukīl rēš lemutti-demon. Scurlock,
based on syllabic spellings, prefers the latter reading (533). Mimma, “anything, something,
everything.” SU = zumru, “body.” ZI = nasāḫu, “to remove, to expel.” The last four words
again follow Sm.1118. The infinitive at the end of the line provides the purpose of the
ritual: to remove (all the evil) from his body. See lines 14 and 16 below.
lū mukīl rēš lemutti iṣbassu lū mimma lemnu iṣbassu ina zumrīšu nasāḫi
Line 3: SAḪAR = eperu, “dust, earth, soil.” URU = ālu, “city.” ŠUB = nadû, “abandoned,
deserted.” Note the phonetic complement –i indicating the adj., nadî; therefore, the phrase
āli nadî is in the genitive and eper, from eperu, must be a bound form. This structure con-
tinues throughout this line and the beginning of the next. É = bītu, “house.” É DINGIR = bīt
ili, “house of a god, temple.” KI . MAḪ = kima(ḫ)ḫu (kimāḫu), “tomb,” a Sumerian loanword.
KIŠI 8 = kulbābu, “ant.” “Dust of an ant” is probably to be rendered “dust from anthill” (see
CAD K, 502). The last word is attested clearly on Sm.1118.
eper āli nadî eper bīti nadî eper bīt ili nadî eper kimaḫi nadî eper kulbābi
Line 4: ÍD = nāru, “river, canal.” “Canal” is preferable here because the other sources
of dust from abandoned places are man-made. KASKAL = ḫarrānu, “road.” 1 -niš = ištēniš,
“together.” TI = leqû, “to gather, to obtain, to take something in hand.” KI = itti, “with.”
ÚŠ = dāmu, “blood.” GU 4 = alpu, “bull, ox.” ḪE . ḪE = bullulu (D of balālu), “to mix (up).” NU
= ṣalmu, “figurine, image.” DÙ = epēšu, “to make, to build.” Were it not for the phonetic
complement, one might be tempted to read DÙ as banû, perhaps the more common verb in
these contexts. See CAD B, 86–87.

Line 5: KUŠ = mašku, “skin.” UR . MAḪ = nēšu, “lion.” A variant reads alpu, “bull,” here
instead. MU 4 . MU 4 = lubbušu (D of labāšu), “to provide with clothing.” Note that –šš– (the
last radical of the root and the first letter of the 3ms pronominal suffix) becomes –ss–.
NA 4 . GUG = sāmtu, “carnelian, (red stone).” È = šakāku, “to string, to thread.” The context
requires that ina be understood as “around,” within the semantic range of “on” in such
contexts. GÚ = kišādu, “neck.” GAR = šakānu, “to put, to place.” KUŠ . A . GÁ . LÁ = narūqu,
“bag,” perhaps “leather bag” (see CAD N/1, 379, AH W , 749). The typical contents of a
narūqu are dry goods, flour, barley, bread, textiles, hides, or the like. A variant reads
KUŠ . A . EDIN . LÁ = nādu, “waterskin,” here. While nādu often denotes a “waterskin,” it too
means leather bag in some contexts (see CAD N/1, 100, AH W , 702). ZÌ . KASKAL = ṣidītu, “(tra-𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 203

Line 6: Ṣudû, “rations, provisions.” SUM = nadānu, “to give.” UD = ūmu, “day.” As a
determiniative, KÁM , generally follows an ordinal number. Therefore, UD . N . KÁM , generally
means “the Nth day.” But here, as in some other cases, it surely means “for N days.” Per-
haps we should read UD . 3 . KÁM here as šalāš umī. Notice that UD . 3 . KÁM is not preceded by
ina nor is there an indication of the plural (compare the expression in lines 11 and 17). ŠUK
= kurummatu, “food ration,” was often barley or flour. ÚTUL = diqāru, “serving bowl.” On
ṣerpētu (ṣirpētu), see CAD Ṣ, 208: “a dish made with barley and milk or fat.” IGI = pānu
“front, face (pl).” Ana pānīšu means “before/in front of him (or it).”

Line 7: ÙR = ūru, “roof.” LÚ . GIG = marṣu, “sick person, patient.” GUB = šuzuzzu (Š of
i/uzuzzu), “to make stand, to set up.” Tušazzassu is a 2ms Š durative (tušazzaz) plus a 3ms
pronominal suffix (–šu). The –zš– cluster becomes –ss–. The –ma, both here and later in this
line, is conjunctive, “and then.” ZÌ = qēmu, “flour.” ŠE . SA . A = qalītu or labtu, “parched
grain” (on labtu, see CDA, 175). The use of flour from parched grain is part of various
rituals; see CAD Q, 59 for other examples. A = mû, “water.” KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” SÌG =
maḫāṣu, “to beat, to weave” here “to stir.” BAL = naqû, “to pour as a libation.”

Line 8: GIŠ . EREN . NA = erēnu, “cedar.” Siltu, “sliver, chip (of wood).” Itû, “boundary.”
Itâtīšu is the fp with a 3ms pronominal suffix; it literally means “its boundaries” but is
being used here as a preposition (see CDA, 137), “all around it.” Zuqqupu (D of zaqāpu),
“to plant, to erect.”

flour. See CAD Z, 138. NIGIN = lamû (lawûm), “to encircle.” DUG . NÍG . DÚR . BÙR = namzītu,
“fermenting vat.” NU = lā, “not.” AL . ŠEG 6 . GÁ should be read ṣarpu when used with earthen-
ware, “refined, fired,” as does CAD Ṣ, 113. It is not as likely to be read bašlu, “cooked,
heat-treated,” which tends not to be used with earthenware.

Line 13: Here ana pāni Šamaš u kakkabī means “day and night” but divine connota-
tions should not be discounted. Ana muḫḫi here means “over (it),” with the “it,” referring
to the figurine’s ritual arrangement, implied. Mitannû (Gtn of manû), “to count repeatedly,
to recite repeatedly.” On the reading of the verb as imtanannu (3cs Gtn durative), see Scur-
lock, 533.
ana pāni Šamaš u kakkabī UD . 3 . KÁM ana muḫḫi imtanannu
Line 14: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, spell, ritual wording.” This indicates to the user of
the tablet that the instructions turn now to what he should recite. This first incantation is
very brief, making it easy to recite repeatedly as prescribed in line 13. Ištu, “from.” Annî,
“this” (gen.). NENNI A NENNI = annanna mar annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so,” is a
common placeholder for the actual name of the supplicant in prayers. Sometimes an even
longer identification formula including the name of a personal god and goddess is used.
See also lines 27 below. ZI = nasāḫu, see line 2; the form is a 2ms predicative (as is the
next three verbs). Šūṣû (Š of [w]aṣû), “to make go out, to dismiss, to expel.”

Line 15: Ṭarādu, “to send away, to drive away.” Kuššudu (D of kašādu), “to drive
away, to chase off.” Šākikka is a ms participle (šākin) with a 2ms pronominal object suffix
(–ka). The n of the root assimilates to the following consonant. The same is true in the
fem. participle in the following line.
ṭardāta u kuššudāta ilu šākikka
Line 16: d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” d 15 is often used in parallel with ilu (see CAD I/J,
272). GIG = marṣu, “sick person, patient.” Issuḫūka is a 3mp G preterite (with 2ms pronom-
inal suffix) from nasāḫu (see line 2 and 14). This is the last line of the first incantation.

Line 17: The ritual instructions resume. On ina UD . 3 . KÁM , see the note on line 6.
= qiddat ūmi, “late afternoon, evening.” In the first instance, KEŠDA repre-
sents a noun in the accusative, riksa, “ritual arrangement.” On contextual and syntactical
grounds, the second instance of KEŠDA must be the verb tarakkas from rakāsu, “to bind, to
prepare, to set up.” The noun and the verb have the same root and appear together in
similar phrases. See CAD R, 351. Notice the return to the second person, indicated more
explicitly in line 18.

Line 18: ÍL = našû, “to raise.” Šudbubu (Š of dabābu), “to make someone speak, to
make someone recite aloud.” Expressions like this are common ritual instructions for pray-
ers. See, e.g., ṣalma šuātu tanaššī-ma kīam taqabbi, “you lift up that image and say this,”
cited in CAD N/2, 83.
marṣu ṣalma inaššī-ma ana pāni Šamaš kīam tušadbabšu
Line 19: The second incantation, Shamash 73, begins here. As is expected, the suppli-
cant’s prayer begins with an invocation and hymnic praise. Muttallu (muttellu), “princely,
noble.” Anunnakkū is a collective name from Sumerian that likely originally specified all
the gods of the pantheon but later, and particularly in Akkadian contexts, may only refer
to gods of earth and the underworld (See Black and Green, 34). Etellu, “pre-eminent, lord.”
On the connotation of etellu as applied to the younger gods, see CAD E, 383. Igigî refers to
the lesser gods of the pantheon. Massû, “leader, expert.” Ṣīru, “first rank, supreme, out-
standing.” Muttarrû, “leader, guide,” has the form of a Gtn participle from arû (see CAD
A/2, 314). Despite the nom. case ending, the word is bound to the following noun in the
gen. Tenēšētu (pl), “people, humankind.”

Line 20: Dayyānu, “judge.” AN = šamû, “heaven.” KI = erṣetu, “earth.” Dayyān šamê u
erṣetim is a very common and old epithet for Shamash. This epithet is particularly poignant
as part of this prayer. It is echoed in line 31, part of the petition, Šamaš dayyānu attā. In
lines 31–33 the supplicant prays for an immediate “verdict” in his case. Enû, “to change, to
shift, to revoke.” The negated infinitive describes a quality of Shamash. Qibītu, “speech,
command.” Qibītuššu includes the locative-adverbial ending –um plus the 3ms pronominal
suffix (–šu). The m assimilates to the š of the suffix. Although we may expect qibīssu here
(as a variant suggests), the locative-adverbial ending does stand sometimes in place of the
accusative (see GAG §66f).
dayyān šamê u erṣeti lā enû qibītuššu
Line 21: Muštēšir is a Št lex. participle (ms) from ešēru, “to cause to straighten, to put
in order.” Ekletu, “darkness.” The idea here is that Shamash puts the darkness in order. See
CAD N/2, 349. Šākin from šakānu is a G participle. Nūru, “light.” Nišū, “people.”
Šamaš muštēšir ekleti šākin nūri ana nišī
Line 22: Erēbu, “to enter,” but with reference to the sun, “to set.” The pronominal suf-
fix becomes the subject of the infinitive’s action: “in your setting.” ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.”
Uteṭṭû (Dt of eṭû), “to be darkened.” Aṣû (waṣûm), “to go out,” but with reference to the
sun, “to rise.” Namāru (nawārum), “to be(come) bright, to shine.” Kibrātu, “the regions,”
specifically the four regions of the earth, the four edges or shores, that is, the whole world.
Šamaš ina erēbīka nūr nišī ūtaṭṭi Šamaš ina aṣîka inammirā kibrāti
Line 23: Ekû (m), ekūtu (f), “impoverished, orphaned.” Almattu, “widow.” Here and
elsewhere in this text, the mimation is archaic and almost certainly aphonemic and likely
aphonetic in which case the signs should perhaps be read tu 4 or tì, as appropriate. The
reason for reading these signs tum and tim is that elsewhere in the text the signs TU and TI
are used for tu and ti. On kigullatu, “waif(?),” see AHw, 474 and CAD K, 349–50. Ruttu
(rūtu), “female associate, companion.” This line serves to indicate that the kala abrātu in
the next line includes even the most disenfranchised elements of humanity.
ekūtu almattu kigullatu u ruttu
Line 24: Ṣītu, “exit,” but with regard to the sun, “rising.” Šutaḫḫunu (Dt of šaḫānu),
“to be warmed up.” The form is a 3fp durative. Kala, “all.” Abrātu, “humankind” appears
only in the pl. See CAD A/1, 62.

put,” and napištu, “life, vitality.” See CAD Š/2, 436. Ṣēru, “steppe, open country.”

ZI
Line 26: Ittabbulu (Gtn of [w]abālu), “to carry constantly, to bring constantly.” The
form is a 3fp durative plus a 2ms pronominal suffix. Napšāssina is the fp of napištu with a
3fp pronominal suffix. But the word could be read differently. For example, Seux (426),
following AHw, 698, reads nablāṭsina from nablāṭu, “healing, life giving.” The final word,
meš-re-ta, is also ambiguous. Is it a variant of mašrītu, “riches” (AHw, 629), as adopted by
Seux (427) and Foster (731), or is it mešrêtu, “limbs,” as Scurlock (535) and von Soden
(323) suggest? Should we understand this as a reference to sacrifice?
ittanabbalāka napšassina mešrêta
Line 27: The two halves of this double line straddle the hymnic introduction and the
petition section of the prayer, thereby providing a transition between the sections. The line
begins by calling on Shamash in his role as judge, a role that is directly applicable to the
petition. It recalls Shamash’s epithet as dayyān šamê u erṣetim in line 20. The first part of
this line summarizes the previous lines of the petition. It then identifies the petitioner via a
standard self-introduction formula. Dīnu, “case, judgment.” Ḫablu (m), ḫabiltu (f),
“wronged person.” While it is possible to understand ḫablu as “oppressed,” “wronged”
seems to work better in the context of this prayer. Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” EŠ . BAR =
purussû, “verdict, decision.” Purussû is commonly used in the context of verdicts from the
gods. Given the medical context of this prayer, we might call the god’s verdict a prognosis;
but for the Mesopotamian, a god’s decision, even with regard to an illness, is ultimately
legal in nature. Šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to put in order, to clear up, to provide justice.”
The form is 2ms durative. Šūnuḫu, “exhausted, troubled.” The adjective is used substanti-
vally here, “the exhausted one.” This is the first hint of a complaint in the prayer. A string
of complaints follows in lines 28–30. Kamāsu, “to kneel.” The form is 1cs predicative.
dīn ḫablim u ḫabilti tadân purussêšina tušteššir
anāku annanna mar annanna šūnuḫu kamsāku
Line 28: Šibšātu, “anger, angry rejection.” Ina must mean something like “on account
of” or “by.” Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, obligation, liability, sin.” Eʾēlu, “to bind.” Iʾʾilanni is a G
3cs durative with a 1cs pronominal object suffix. The ša introduces a relative clause that
describes the condition of the supplicant. They are bound due to divine anger, which may
be the result of some ritual failure but it need not be. Notice the alliteration in this line.

Line 29: UDUG = utukku, “demon, ghost.” MAŠKIM = rābiṣu, “demonic guardian,” see
CAD R, 23. GIDIM = eṭemmu, “ghost.” (As a symptom of one or more diseases, see Scurlock
and Andersen, Diagnoses, 436–37, 441, 455–56; eṭemmu can also be the cause of disease,
see CAD E, 397.) LÍL . LÁ = lilû, a kind of demon (see CAD L, 190 and Scurlock and Ander-
sen, Diagnoses, 434–36). Concerning ḫimītu (ḫimittu), dimītu, šimmat šīri (= UZU ), and
ṣīdānu: the several differing attempts listed here to provide definitions for these words
illustrate the considerable uncertainty about their meanings. (“Scurlock” in the list refers

Scurlock and Andersen treat several of these in their Diagnoses: for ḫimītu, see 289–90; for

translation will be tentative.

Line 30: Šaššaṭu, “stiff joints.” Following CAD Ṣ, 171, Seux translates šaššaṭu as
“L’arthrite” (427); Scurlock does not translate it at all (535). Scurlock and Andersen sug-
gest that this symptom is best understood by the modern term “tetanus” (Diagnoses, 66–
68). See also CAD Š/2, 175: [šumma kišāssu?] qablāšu ašṭa šaššaṭa MU . NI , “[If his neck?]
(and) hips are stiff, it is called šaššaṭu” (citing BAM 129 iv 3). Miqittu, “attack.” Ṭēmu here
means “reason” or the like. Miqit ṭēmi is “an attack on reason.” Šaqālu, “to weigh, to bal-
ance.” Išqulūnim-ma is a G 3mp preterite with a 1cs dative pronominal suffix and an enclit-
ic –ma. In this line we see two different uses of the enclitic –ma. On the verb (išqulūnim-
ma), the –ma functions as a conjunction, binding this sentence with the next. UD = ūmu,
“day.” Ūmišam-ma, “daily,” from ūmi plus –išam and the enclitic –ma. The –išam suffix
often forms distributive adverbs from nouns (see GAG §67g): “day” becomes “daily.” Here
the –ma brings special emphasis to the adverb ūmišam. The reading of the final verb is
uncertain (Scurlock’s MS B has ú-dam-ma-mu-[. . .). Attempts to derive the verb from
damāmu, damû, or ṭamû all flounder on morphological and/or contextual grounds. (The
capital D’s in the transliteration indicate uncertainty about the value of the dental conso-
nant. Should we read uṭ-ṭam- or ud-dam-?) A scribal error cannot be ruled out.

Line 31: The line comprises three clauses. The first clause is verbless and conveys the
supplicant’s confidence in Shamash’s judicial role. DI . KUD = dayyānu. Note that line 20
spells dayyānu syllabically, da-a-a-an, while here the text uses a logogram. Attā, “you”
(ms). The second clause illustrates the supplicant’s confidence through action. (W)abālu,
“to carry, to bring.” Ublakka is the G 1cs preterite (ubil) with a ventive (–am) and a 2ms
pronominal suffix (–ka). The m of the ventive has assimilated to the k of the pronominal
suffix (–mk– becomes –kk–). The verb is performative. By speaking it the supplicant per-
forms the implied action (i.e., saying that he brings his life to Shamash actually brings his
life to Shamash). The final clause is more complex. The first dīnu in the line must mean
“case, issue” or the like; the second means “judgment, verdict, prognosis.” GIG = murṣu,
“sickness, disease.” (This reading follows MS C, see also Seux, 427, n.22; MS A reads LÚ . GIG
= marṣu, “patient, sick person.”) The relative clause that follows murṣu defines the sick-
ness further via the verb iṣbatanni. The supplicant is kneeling submissively, the line says,
waiting for the deity to render a verdict about the case of disease that has seized him.
Šamaš dayyānu attā-ma napištī ublakka dīnu murṣi ša iṣbatanni ana dīni kamsāku
Line 32: Dīn is a ms impv. from dânu (see line 27) with a cognate accusative (dīnu).
The phonetic compliment on EŠ . BAR (-a-a) indicates that purussû ends in a long a. KUD =
parāsu, “to cut,” but with purussû it means “to render a decision or verdict.” Adi, “until,”
begins a temporal clause. Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause someone or something to acquire
something.” Tušaršû is a 2ms preterite with subjunctive (–u).
dīnu dīn purussâ purus adi dīnī purussâ tušaršû
Line 33: The text follows Seux in the reading of the first lacuna (see 427, n.23). The
restoration of the second lacuna follows Scurlock (532). Šanû, “another.” SUM = nadānu,
“to give, to deliver.” The construction lā tanaddin is a prohibitive, a negative impv. (“do
not”). The object of the verb follows it. A temporal clause, parallel to the one in line 32,
begins with the word ištu and introduces the prayer’s concluding section of praise. The
basic meanings of the preposition ištu are “from, since;” here it means “after.” (Note that
MS A reads the earlier form, ištu, while MS C reads ultu, the later form.) The verb in the
clause, tušteršû (for tuštaršû), is a 2ms perfect with subjunctive from šuršû (see line 32).
ana dīni šanîm-ma lā tanaddin purussâšu ištu dīnī purussâ tušteršû
Line 34: On eʾiltu (iʾiltu), see line 28. This word is the subject of the following two
verbs. (W)uššuru (D of [w]ašāru), “to release, to set free.” Although no subjunctive marker
is present (due to the object suffix), this verb is part of the subordinate clause from the
previous line (beginning with ištu). SU . MU = zumrī, zumru plus 1cs pronominal suffix (Sum.
MU = –ia 5 ). Naprušu (N, no G stem), “to fly”; in a simile “to flee.” The form is a 3cs perfect21035. [ AN -u liḫ]-du-ka

with subjunctive, indicating that this verb also continues the subordinate clause. Ēm(a),
“wherever.” Takālu, “to trust.” Mitguru (Gt of magāru), “to agree with one another, to come
to an agreement.” Pūka, “your mouth, your word.” We expect pī– before a pronominal
suffix, but pū– does occur in literature (see Scurlock, 533, citing AHw, 872). The Gt of
magāru is reciprocal and thus does not take an object. Pūka therefore must be taken adver-
bially, “(with regard to) your word.” Many translators suspect an error at the end of this
line, emending it to read likrubūka, “may they bless you” (see Foster, 731, Seux, 427, n.26,
and implied by von Soden, 324).
iʾiltī ūtašširanni ina zumrīya ittaprašu ēma taklāku ilū limtagrū pūku
Line 35: Ḫadû, “to be joyful.” Râšu (riāšum), “to rejoice.” TU 6 ÉN is a common Sumeri-
an formula that marks the end of the incantation, closing out what ÉN in line 19 began.
Notice the reprise “heaven and earth” thematically reflecting the divine epithet of Sha-
mash as judge of heaven and earth in the invocations to the prayer.
šamû liḫdūka erṣeti lirīška TU 6 ÉN
Line 36: Mirroring the language at the end of line 20, kīam tušadbabšu brackets the
supplicant’s prayer. DUG = karpatu, “pot.” GAR -an = tašakkan. Tummû (D of tamû), “to
bind by oath, to make someone swear.” Tutammāšu is a 2ms durative with a 3ms pronomi-
nal suffix. The 3ms pronouns on the verbs refer to the figurine. Tutammāšu introduces
what Scurlock calls a “ritual oath formula” (533). Such formulae occur in several ghost
prescriptions but are far from exclusive to such texts.
kīam tušadbabšu ana karpati tašakkaššū-ma tutammāšu
Line 37: Nīšu, “(oath on the) life.” The ritual formula literally reads, “(by) the life of
the earth/heaven.” Lū expresses a wish. Tamāta is a G 2ms predicative from tamû, “to
swear, to adjure.” DU 11 . GA = qabû, “to say.” We expect a 2ms durative form here. KÁ =
bābu, “gate, door;” but since it refers to the jar, it means “opening.” ÚŠ = peḫû, “to block,
to close, to seal.”
nīš šamê lū tamāta nīš erṣeti lū tamāta nīš Šamaš lū tamāta taqabbī-ma bābšu tepeḫḫi
Line 38: Ḫarbu, “desert, wasteland.” Nadûti, from nadû, see line 3. Qebēru, “to bury.”
Note how the ritual instructions come full circle with the mention of nadû: the abandoned
dust used to create the figurine is returned to an abandoned place.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Tawil demonstrated that Akkadian ṣalmu, “figurine, image” and Hebrew ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫צ‬ ֶ
are not only cognates but also share nearly identical semantic ranges (Tawil,𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 211
ALCBH, 323). However, in all cases save two, the creation of man (Gen 1:26–27)
and the birth of Seth (Gen 5:3), the Hebrew Bible views having, making, or
being a ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫צ‬ ֶ negatively. The expression ‫ם‬ ‫ֹת‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ‫תוֹע‬
‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫צ‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬, “and images of their abomi-
nations,” in Ezek 7:20, and ‫ם‬ ‫יכ‬ ֶ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫צ‬,
“your images,” in Amos 5:26 are examples of
the negative evaluations of figurines or images. Nowhere does the Hebrew Bible
clearly refer to a ‫ם‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫צ‬ ֶ as having the same or similar function as the ṣalmu in this
Akkadian ritual. 1
The semantic equivalent of the complete epithet dayyān šamê u erṣeti, “judge
of heaven and earth,” does not occur in the Hebrew Bible. However, ‫ט‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֵ ‫שׁ‬ ‫א‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ִ
‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬,
“judge of the earth rise up,” in Ps 94:2 may reflect the first part of the epi-
thet here applied to Yahweh. The phrase ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ל־ה‬
‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ט‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֵ ‫שׁ‬ , “judge of all the earth,” in
Gen 18:25 may reflect the same traditional usage. 2 On “judge” as a divine epi-
thet in the Hebrew Bible, see Shamash 1 in the comparative suggestions (page
379).

recite as follows:
19. Incantation: O Shamash, noble among the Anunnakki, prince among the
Igigi, pre-eminent leader, guide of the people,
20. Judge of heaven and earth, unchanging with regard to his command,

31. O Shamash, you are the judge. I bring you my life. I am kneeling for a
verdict with regard to the case of the disease that has seized me.
32. Judge my case. Provide my verdict. Until you make my case come to a
verdict,
33. To another case, do not deliver its verdict. After you make my case come to
verdict,
34. (And) my binding releases me and flees from my body, wherever I put my
trust, may the gods agree with one another with regard to what you say (lit.
your mouth).
35. May the heavens be joyful with you. May the earth rejoice in you. End of
incantation.
36. Thus you have him speak. You put it (i.e., the figurine) in a pot and you bind
it (i.e., the figurine) by oath: 37. “By Earth be adjured; by Heaven be adjured; by
Shamash be adjured,” you say and then you block its (i.e, the pot’s) opening.
38. . . . You bury it in abandoned wastelands.𒌋𒁹 A R ITUAL AND I NCANTATION -P RAYER AGAINST G HOST -I NDUCED I LLNESS : S HAMASH 73 213

A Shuilla: Anu 1
K YLE G REENWOOD
A NU :
Anu is known throughout Mesopotamian mythology as the sky god. The dei-
ty is represented in cuneiform with the AN sign. When this sign is read in Sume-
rian, it is pronounced /an/ and means “heaven,” which is the Sumerian name
for the deity (Sum. An; Akk. Anu). The sign is also commonly read in Sumerian
as dingir, which may refer to the generic word for “deity,” Akk. ilu, or as the
determinative for any deified being ( d DN). In the earliest cuneiform writing, AN
resembled a star or rosette.
In classic Mesopotamian mythology Anu was one of the three highest
ranked deities, along with Enlil and Ishtar. However, in the Great Hymn of the
Queen of Nippur, Anu shares paternity with Enlil and Sin. Anu possessed the
authority to decree and elevate fates. Along with Enlil, Anu was responsible for
conferring kingship and granting royal authority. Some epithets of Anu include
šar ilī, “king of the gods”; šar šamê, “king of heaven”; and šar matāti, “king of the
lands.”
As is the case with the other celestial deities, Anu is not only the god whose
dominion is heaven; Anu also represents the heavens themselves. Anu is the an-
tithesis of erṣetu, “earth.” In Atram-ḫasīs, Anu is known as abu, “father,” and the
aforementioned šar ilī, “king of the gods.” While Anu ascended to heaven, Enlil
assumed control of the earth. The Sumerian myth Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the
Netherworld intimates that heaven and earth were once a single entity, until
Anu carried off and occupied heaven, and Enlil carried off and occupied earth.
In the Tukulti-Ninurta Epic, Anu is associated with military action. In this
epic Anu is said to press miṭṭa lā pādâ elu targīgi “the relentless mace upon the
wicked.” However, Anu is not typically associated with warfare. Rather, the dei-
ty is summoned amid dire circumstances so the Kassite king Kashtiliash might
feel the full brunt of Assyria’s pantheon.
Based on the textual and archaeological record, the cult of Anu had limited
official geographical distribution. Apparently, Anu received limited homage in
Dilbat, Kesh and Ur. However, the deity also appears to have had a dais at É-sag-
íl in Babylon. In Ashur, Anu and Adad shared a long-standing temple that con-
sisted of a pair of ziggurats, one for each deity. Of primary significance, howev-
er, was the Anu cult in Uruk. Anu’s temple, named Bīt Rēš in Akkadian, was one
217218of two major temple structures, the other one being the temple of Inana. Both
temples were extensively rebuilt during the Seleucid and Parthian periods.
In Mesopotamian astronomical tradition, “the path of Anu” (ḫarrān šūt
Anim) lay between the “paths” of Enlil and Ea (see page 411 for more on the
celestial “paths”). With respect to iconography, Anu’s divine symbol is the
horned cap. His divine number was 60, the highest among the gods.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer to Anu follows the standard tripartite construction of a shuilla.
The hymnic introduction (lines 1–8a) consists of four parts. The first three parts
are organized in sets of parallel lines, following Sumerian hymnic style (see
Mayer, UFBG, 40). In each case, the second line begins with the vocative “O
Anu” then repeats the first line verbatim. The first of the four parts impresses
upon the deity his worthiness to be called upon. Anu is “magnificent” and is
associated with holy purification rites. The second part appeals to Anu’s status in
the cosmic realm. The third and fourth parts of the hymnic introduction shift
from appealing to the deity’s generic value as the hearer of prayers to the deity’s
specific merit for hearing this particular prayer. Not only is Anu the magnificent
god of the heavens, but, more importantly to the supplicant, Anu is the deity
who can remove the afflictions from this persecuted human.
The petition section (lines 8b–13) consists of a series of five requests, fol-
lowed by the imperative “have mercy!” There is a sort of rhythmic cadence in
this section as the prayer moves from the beneficence of the deity to the trans-
gressions of the person; from the ferocity of the supplicant’s personal gods, to
the compassion of the magnificent Anu. The petition demonstrates the precari-
ous nature in which anguished people of the ancient world found themselves
with respect to their health and the whims of the gods.
The prayer concludes (lines 14–16) with a section of promissory praise.
Should Anu successfully intervene on behalf of the supplicant, this person will
reward the deity with riches and honor.
Aside from the use of parallelism in the first section, the prayer employs a
number of recurring words. For example, bēlu occurs once in each of the first six
lines and once in line 15. Pašāru occurs in participial form three times in the
hymnic introduction and twice as a precative in the petition section. In that
same section, lemnētu and Ḫaṭâtu appear three times each. These recurring words
are significant in that they not only influence the themes of their respective sec-
tions, but they also serve to unify the prayer as a cohesive composition.
In the Bīt salāʾ mê purification ritual series this prayer to Anu initiates the
ninth section (pirsu) of the series, which consists of prayers to multiple deities,
including Nusku, Sin, Gula and Shamash. The ritual itself was named for the
location in which it was performed, the Bīt salāʾ mê, “House of Water Sprin-𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : A NU 1
219
kling.” It involved the transfer of evil from the king to its suspected source by
means of a purification bath. 1
There are three known MSS of this prayer, BMS 6: 1–16 (referred to here as
MS A), CT 51 211 ( MS B), and LKA 50 ( MS C). All of these are incomplete, but the
latter is the best preserved (at least, after line 6). The treatment presented here
follows the line numbering of BMS 6 as a matter of convenience (see likewise
Foster’s translation). The text at the beginning of the prayer is very fragmentary,
shows signs of scribal errors (especially in MS C), and varies among the sources.
The text of lines 1–6 presented here is, therefore, tentative. With line 7, this
treatment follows MS C. Even here, due to the fragmentary nature of the text,
many reconstructions are conjectural. The present text cannot substitute for
studying the original manuscripts or consulting a new modern edition, which is
unfortunately still a desideratum.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer, but is not a part of the prayer itself. EN = bēlu, “master, lord, ruler.” Šurbû,
“great, supreme,” is a Š stem verbal adjective from rabû. Note that the superlative form in
Akkadian, known as the elative, is expressed via the Š verbal adjective. The prayer begins
appropriately by praising the deity as bēlu šurbû, “most excellent lord.” Ša with a resump-
tive pronoun such as – Š u attached to a noun X is a common grammatical construct mean-
ing “whose X.” Ina šamê (= AN ), “in heaven,” reflects Anu’s chief role as god of the heav-
ens. Šuluḫḫu, “purification rite,” usually occurs in the plural, as here (see CAD Š/3, 260).
Ellū is a G 3mp predicative from elēlu (= KÙ ), “to be clean, pure, holy, sacred.”

Line 2: Lines 1–6 consist of three pairs of parallel lines that imitate Sumerian hymnic
style. Each pair moves from the general to the specific. The first line of each pair addresses
the deity with a particular epithet. The epithet is repeated verbatim in the second line of
the pair, except that the deity addressed is called by name. Notice the retention of mi-
mation in the DN Anu, which is otherwise absent in the text.
Anum bēlu šurbû ša ina šamê šuluḫḫūšu ellū
Line 3: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” MS B begins the line with bēlu instead of ilu. Ṣaddu means
“sign, signal,” particularly as it pertains to omens. AGA = agû, “crown.” In some texts the
crown of Anu represents kingship in the divine council. The title bēl agê, “lord of the
crown,” also underscores Anu’s authority to coronate kings. In the astrological text Astro-
labe B, the crown of Anu is a constellation called is lê, “Jawbone-of-an-Ox.”
il šamê bēl ṣaddi bēl agê
Line 4: If the connection between Anu and the heavens were not clear from line 1,
there can be no mistaking the connection in line 4. This relationship is even more striking
with the presence of three DINGIR signs in the line. There is some ambiguity—perhaps
intended—regarding the precise function of the genitive šamê. The options are “heaven’s
god,” “the heavenly god,” “the god in heaven,” or “the god whose domain is the heavens.”
MS C seems to have skipped our lines 4 and 5, probably due to parablepsis (homoioarch-
ton).
Anum il šamê bēl ṣaddi bēl agê
Line 5: Lines 5–8 employ substantive participles to define the attributes of the deity
that are pertinent to the petitioner’s request. Pašāru, “to release, to loosen.” As is often the
case with this verb, a deity, in this case Anu, is its agent. Ūmu, “day,” is in the genitive
case, which is to be expected by the fact that it is preceded by a participle in the bound
form. The exact meaning of pāšir ūmi, “the one who absolves the day,” is uncertain. One
suggestion is that it refers to a clearing of the weather (see CAD P, 239). The context of the
prayer does not warrant such an interpretation here. Rather, the day in question is likely
the day of suffering, which is the impetus for the prayer. Thus, it likely refers to the re-
moval of that day of suffering from the memory of the supplicant.
pāšir ūmi bēl ṣaddi bēl agê
Line 6: MS B attests the start of a fragmentary line between lines 5 and 6 and again
between lines 6 and 7. In both cases the line reads mukallim ṣaddi, “the one who reveals
the sign.”

Line 7: MÁŠ . GE 6 = šuttu (pl. šunātu), “dream.” ḪUL = lemnu, “bad, evil, wicked.” Ḫaṭû
(ḫāṭû), “wrong, defective, portending evil.” Pardu, “frightening,” particularly as it pertains
to dreams. Á . MEŠ = idātu, “powers, signs, omens.” GISKIM . MEŠ = ittātu, “marks, signs,
omens.” Pāšir is followed by a string of fp genitive nouns and adjectives. The first noun,
šunāti, is modified by three adjectives, lemnēti, haṭâti, and pardāti. The adjective lemnēti is
understood here as modifying both idāti and ittāti, though it is equally plausible that it
only modifies the latter. From this line to the end of the prayer, MS C is the textual basis.
pāšir šunāti lemnēti ḫaṭâti pardāti idāti ittāti lemnēti
Line 8: Lines 8 and 9 are problematic from a textual perspective. The present treat-
ment closely follows MS C (cited as an alternate reading in Seux, 271, n.11 and a variant by
Foster, 640, n.2). Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to cause to pass through, to cross,” thus “to remove,
to avert.” Lumnu, “evil, wickedness.” Ḫiṭītu, “act of negligence, sin, offense.” Gillatu,
“crime, misdeed, sin.” Maruštu (maruṣtu, marṣu, see CAD M/I, 291), “severe, grievous.”
Ḫūṣu, “pain.” GAZ = ḫīpu at its root means “a break,” but this brokenness when applied to
one’s health connotes “disease, ailment, or affliction.” Ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi is understood idiomati-
cally and may refer to either physical or emotional pain (CAD Ḫ, 260). Originally, ḫūṣ ḫīpi
libbi was likely a hendiadys, explaining the use of the plural verb (see luptaṭṭirū in line 9).
The relative ša that follows begins a subordinate clause telling more about this situation in
terms of the supplicant’s experience. The three verbs in the subordinate clause are plural
forms. Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be inflicted” (CAD Š/1, 154). The enclitic –ma joins this
verb with line 9.
mušēteq lumni ḫiṭīte u gillate marušte ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi ša iššaknū-ma
Line 9: UŠ . UŠ = riteddû (Gtn of redû), “to guide constantly, to control constantly; to
persecute continually.” The reduplication of the UŠ sign is an indication of the Gtn. Kussu
(D of kasû), “to bind.” I take the first two verbs in this line as duratives, showing the ongo-
ing effects of the situation described by iššaknū-ma in line 8. UZU = šīru, “flesh.” TI . LA =
balāṭu, “life.” Tû, “incantation, spell.” Ina tēka ša balāṭi is a formulaic expression. Seux
(271, n.12) suggests ittēka, as preserved in MS C, might be a contraction of ina tēka, which
is only preserved in MS A. Putaṭṭuru (Dt of paṭāru), “to be loosened, to be released.” The lu–
prefix usually indicates a 1cs precative but the verb seems to refer back to Ḫūṣ ḫīpi libbi
(understood as a plural) and therefore must be a 3cp precative. Therefore, the prefix, only
attested in MS C from Ashur, is probably an Assyrianism. See GAG §81c on page 132.

Line 10: Mimmû mala, “all that,” introduces a relative clause. Note the 1cs pronomi-
nal suffixes ( MU ) on ilu and ištaru (= IŠ 8 . DAR ), indicating these are the supplicant’s personal22211. lìb-bi DINGIR . MU u [ d IŠ 8 . DAR . MU ] ze-nu-te a-na KI -šú l[i-tu-ur]

god and goddess. Ištaru, rather than iltu, is used for the personal goddess when parallel
with ilu (see CAD I/J, 90). Aḫṭû is a G 1cs preterite (aḫṭi) plus subjunctive –u from ḫaṭû, “to
do wrong (ana, to), to sin (against).” Lippašra is a 3cs precative with the ventive from
napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released.”
mimmû mala ana ilīya u ištarīya aḫṭû lippašra
Line 11: Zenû, “angry.” The genitive plural form of this adj. indicates it modifies both
ilu and ištaru. Târu with ašru means, “to return to normal, to subside.” In ancient Mesopo-
tamian thought, physical distress was most often associated with offenses committed
against the gods. The only remedy was to appease the gods, confess one’s transgressions,
and plea for divine reprieve. Thus, the request is for freedom from the physical anguish
caused by the angry gods.
libbi ilīya u ištarīya zenūte ana ašrīšu litūr
Line 12: Aggu, “angry.” As is typical in the phrase aggu libbu, aggu assumes the atypi-
cal position of preceding the noun it modifies. Libbu often refers to the heart as the seat of
the intellect; therefore, “mind, intent, choice.” Note the use of a 2ms pronominal suffix
rather than the 2mp, as we might expect as both god and goddess were previously men-
tioned. Linūḫa is a G 3cs precative with ventive from nâhu, “to be at rest, to relent.”
aggu libbaka linūḫa
Line 13: Kabattu (kabtatu in poetic texts) is literally a “liver” but it also means “emo-
tions, thoughts, mind, spirit.” It is the subject of lippašra from napšuru, for which see line
10. Rašû, “to get, to acquire.” The form is a ms impv. with ventive. On the expression rišâ
rēmu and its variants, see Mayer, UFBG, 225. Having declared Anu as the deity who gener-
ally releases (pašāru) misfortune in line 7, the supplicant now calls upon the deity to make
those powers effective in this particular case. One should expect rēmu to be in the accusa-
tive case, but the nominative frequently stands for the accusative in SB Akkadian and the
current form is frequently attested in the idiom, rišâ rēmu, “to show pity; have mercy” (see
CAD R, 199).
lippašra kabtatka rišâ rēmu
Line 14: Ṭuḫḫudu (D of ṭaḫādu), “to provide lavishly, to endow richly, to make pros-
perous.” The characteristic doubled second radical in the orthography is missing. However,
the a-i vowel pattern is sufficient to diagnose this form as a D 1 cs precative. É = bītu,
“house.” The function of both precatives in this sentence is to conclude the petitions in
lines 8b–13. The supplicant wishes to lavish the deity with material and verbal offerings
when the deity honors his request. Šigaru, “door bolt, lock.” Zanānu, “to poor out, to drip.”
Here the form is a Š 1cs precative. The causative verb takes the double accusative: “I make𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : A NU 1

Line 15: Dalīlū, “praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlī ludlul is a cognate accusative con-
struction; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomat-
ically, “let me proclaim the praises.”

Line 16: Narbû, “greatness,” is a verbal adjective from the N stem of rabû. The singu-
lar bound form is narbi. Kayyāna, “always, constantly.” Note the antecedent for the 2ms
pronominal suffix on ilūtu is Anu. The –ūt ending on the noun ilu is the abstract noun
marker, creating the meaning “the state of being a god” or “divinity.” Šitammuru (Gtn of
šamāru), “to praise continually.”

Line 17: The prayer concludes with a standard shuilla-rubric. All but the god’s name
is written in Sumerian.
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Aside from its structural similarity to biblical prayers of lament like Ps 22,
perhaps the most obvious point of comparison with this text and the Hebrew
Bible is the association of the deity with the heavens. In this shuilla Anu is twice
referred to as il šamê, “god of heaven,” a reference to the deity’s cosmic abode,
or to its very divine nature. The biblical equivalent occurs as ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ in BH
and as ‫א‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫ש‬ ְ ‫הּ‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫א‬ ֱ in biblical Aramaic. Most, if not all, of the twenty-three instanc-
es of this phrase seem to appear in late texts. 1 Nonetheless, the authors of the
Hebrew Bible apply this epithet to their god, Yahweh.
However, this point of contact leads also to a point of strong contrast. It is
one thing to be deemed the heavenly god, or to have the heavens declared a
god, as is the case with Anu. It is quite another matter simply to state that the
heavens constitute one of the abodes of the deity, as is the case with Yahweh. In
fact, the Hebrew Bible is adamant that the heavens are not divine, but are mere-
ly one of Yahweh’s many creations. Genesis 1:1 proclaims that Elohim “created
1
See Gen 24:3, 7; 2 Chr 36:23; Ezra 1:2; 5:11; 7:12, 21, 23 (x2); Neh 1:2, 4, 5; 2:4, 20; Dan
2:18, 37, 44; Jonah 1:9. Although the dating of Gen 24:3 and 7 is speculative, J. van Seters has
made the most cogent argument for dating the Yahwist source to the late exilic period (Abraham
in History and Tradition [New Haven: Yale, 1975], 148–53). Another view is that Gen 24:3, 7
reflect “an older concept” that is revived in the Persian period (Hutter, 389).224the heavens and the earth.” In Isa 42:5, Yahweh is “the one who created the
heavens.” The phrase is not an action, but an epithet; it serves to define Yah-
weh’s role and power. Ps 102:25 expresses the same idea in more anthropo-
morphic terms, “the heavens are the work of your hands.” This idea of Yahweh
as creator of the heavens, not simply a resident of the heavens, is conveyed in
multiple texts in which Yahweh is said to have created the heavenly bodies, such
as the sun, moon, stars, and constellations. Thus, while Anu and Yahweh are
both gods of the heavens, the Hebrew Bible repeatedly distinguishes Yahweh
from the heavens. One possible exception is Dan 4:23, ‫א‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫ן‬ ‫ט‬ ִ ‫לּ‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫דּ‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ‫דּ‬ ַ ְ‫נ‬ ‫ת‬ ִ , “You
will acknowledge that Heaven is mighty.” In this case, “Heaven” is the subject of
the predicate adjective “mighty,” and represents the only instance in which
“Heaven” is synonymous with the god of Israel. 2 However, it may well be that
“Heaven” is no more deified in this verse than “the White House” is considered
the President of the United States. Each refers to the location from which ulti-
mate authority of its respective precinct resides.
Although the phrase pāšir ūmi does not have a counterpart in BH, the con-
cept is at the forefront of Job’s distress. During the initial response to his calami-
ty, he cried out ‫ְך‬ ‫ֺשׁ‬ ֶ ‫ח‬ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ְ‫י‬ ‫הוּא‬ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫היּוֺם‬ , “may that day (i.e., the day he was born) be as
darkness” (3:4). If that day had never happened, he would not have lived his
tortuous existence. While not worded the same, Job’s desire is essentially the
same as that of this prayer’s supplicant, namely, may the deity remove all traces
of this arduous day from thought or memory. On a separate note, the verb
pašāru has ‫פתר‬ as its Hebrew cognate and ‫פשׁר‬ as its Aramaic cognate. This verb
is found only in the context of the Joseph Narrative (Gen 40–41) and in Dan 5.
Always with “dream” as its object, it literally means, “to loosen the dream,” im-
plying that there is a trapped meaning of the dream that must be released in
order for the dream to be interpreted.
Continuing this theme, dreams in the ancient Near East were powerful forc-
es. They were considered channels of divine communication. 3 Given the fact that
deities could be either beneficent or malevolent depending on one’s piety,
dreams could elicit a frightening experience. Such is the case, once again, with
Job. He cries out in protest to Yahweh, “If I say, ‘My bed comforts me and my
couch bears my complaint,’ then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with
visions; so that my throat chooses suffocation, and my bones, death” (7:13–15).
In this light, it is no wonder both the supplicant and Job would wish for dreams
to be absolved.
Line 14 reflects the ancient Near Eastern notion that the earthly temple was
a scale model of the deity’s heavenly residence. A stairway connected the two
abodes, with a gate situated at the top of the stairway at the entrance of the
2
The idea of a deified heaven is prevalent in the books of 1 Macc (3:18, 19, 50; 4:24) and 2
Macc (7:11; 8:20).

cosmic dwelling. This concept is most clearly reflected in the Tower of Babel
narrative of Gen 11:1–9. It is also reflected in Gen 28:17, in which Jacob, after
having experienced a terrifying theophany, proclaimed, ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ית‬ ‫ם־בּ‬
‫א‬ ִ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫ז‬ ‫ין‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫זּ‬ ‫ה‬ ַ
‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫ז‬ ְ‫ו‬ , “Is this none other than the temple of the gods? Is this not the
gate of heaven?” Jacob not only alludes to the mythological concept, but also
affirms it by equating the temple with the gate of heaven. This notion is likely at
work in Ezek 43:4, as well, in which Yahweh’s glory enters the temple by way of
the gate.

A Shuilla: Ea 1a
A LAN L ENZI
E A :
Ea (Akk.; Sum. Enki) was the god of fresh water, wisdom, and magic. Origi-
nally from the southern city of Eridu (modern Abu Shahrain), Ea was venerated
throughout Mesopotamia from earliest times into the Hellenistic period. Besides
his temple at Eridu, Ea had cult installations in Borsippa, Drehem, Kish, Lagash,
Larsa, Mari, Shuruppak, Umma, and Uruk, among others. In the first millenni-
um, the imperial capitals of Assyria and Babylon both had prominent cult cen-
ters dedicated to the deity.
Various traditions make Ea the son of Anu or the son of the goddess Nam-
mu. His wife is Damgalnuna/Damkina. His most prominent son is Marduk,
though he is also the father of Adapa and Nanshe, among others. His well-known
grandson is Nabu, god of wisdom and scribes. Ea’s vizier is the two-faced
Isimud/Usmu.
Ea was first and foremost the god of fresh water, the basis of life and agri-
cultural abundance. The ancient city of Eridu was the location of his main tem-
ple, É-abzu, “Apsu-house” (also called É-engur-ra, “House of Fresh Waters”),
which in ancient times was situated in a marshy area near the coast where the
Euphrates emptied into the Persian Gulf. This ecological locale may explain his
watery association and almost certainly the large amounts of fish bones—
remnants of offerings—that archaeologists have recovered in deep soundings of
his temple. 1
Mythologically, Ea resided in a subterranean watery place called the Apsû,
the source of all fresh waters. According to Enūma eliš Tablet I, Apsu (male) and
Tiamat (female) were originally two primordial bodies of water that mingled to
create all of the gods. When Ea learned of Apsu’s plot to kill his noisy offspring,
Ea immobilized Apsu with an incantation, killed him, and turned him into his
divine abode. This mythological narrative reflects what is widely known from
other religious and ritual texts: Ea’s incantatory word was powerful and effective
(see our lines 13, 24, and 26).
1
See Michael D. Danti and Richard L. Zettler, “Eridu,” in OEANE 2:258–60.
227228Ea was widely known in Mesopotamian tradition as a protective, benevo-
lent, and caring god to humans. According to several myths, Ea had a hand in
creating humanity and was always ready to help preserve his creation in the face
of danger, even when this meant, as in Gilgamesh XI and Atram-ḫasīs, subverting
the plan of the other gods who had decreed humanity’s destruction. As seen in
the myths Inana and Enki and Enki and the World Order, Ea was also the origi-
nal holder of the divine powers (Sum. me) that gave shape to the world and or-
ganized human civilization. According to another sparsely preserved tradition,
Ea sent seven antediluvian sages (apkallū) to bring the arts of civilization to hu-
manity; the most prominent of these is Adapa. These seven sages occasionally
appear in incantations. 2
As god of wisdom and magic, Ea played a prominent role as patron of vari-
ous crafts, including those of everyday artisans as well as those especially asso-
ciated with intermediation between humans and gods (i.e., exorcism, lamenta-
tion, divination, astrology, and medicine in the first millennium). 3 A common
incantatory phrase used in namburbi-rites, “Ea has done, Ea has undone” (īpuš
Ea ipšur Ea), reflects Ea’s protective and benevolent character as well as the mag-
ical power of his word. 4
In keeping with his role as god of water, Ea was identified in iconography
by streams of water pouring out of his shoulders. Sometimes he appears in a
structure that is surrounded by water, probably representing the Apsu. In post-
Kassite times, Ea was symbolized by the goat-fish, a turtle, or a curved staff with
a ram’s head on the end.
Like Anu and Enlil, Ea was associated with one of the three regions (or
“paths,” ḫarrānū) of the sky and the stars therein. Ea’s region was the southern
most (see page 411 for more on the celestial “paths”). Ea was closely associated
with the constellation Nūnu, “The Fish” (our Piscis Austrinus). Ea’s divine num-
ber was 40.
T HE P RAYER :
Ea 1a follows the typical tri-partite structure found in many other incanta-
tion-prayers. The prayer begins with a fairly long introductory hymn in lines 1–
13, continues with the supplication section in lines 14–28, and concludes with
three lines of praise (lines 29–31).

stanzas) of unequal size. Lines 1–6 form the first part. In each of these lines
there are two epithets for Ea, each of which celebrates his authority, wisdom,
and/or role as creator and sustainer. These latter two roles are expressed by
means of participles in lines 1a and 6, which grammatically distinguish them
from the other epithets in this first part of the hymn. The very general epithets
in line 1 are complemented in lines 2–5 by several that localize Ea in his home
town of Eridu and the cult centers dedicated to him there (É-abzu, É-engur-ra,
and É-unir). Finally, line 6, with its reference to waterways, prepares for the
second section of the hymn in lines 7–8. This second part utilizes tight grammat-
ical parallelism (see the comments to line 8) and second person verbs to bestow
praise upon the deity. Ea’s natural sphere of influence (i.e., water and abun-
dance) comes into clear focus here. In the third part of the hymn (lines 9–11)
the hymn shifts to describe what others think of Ea. Third person verbs domi-
nate these lines. Foreshadowing the concluding praise of the prayer (see lines
29–31), lines 9–10 depict the gods of heaven and the netherworld praising Ea. In
line 11, the people, sandwiched between the two divine realms, praise Ea for his
authority (zikirka kabta) and thereby prepare both for the final section of the
hymn and lines 14–16 in the petitions. 5 Lines 12–13 close the hymn with a ref-
erence to Ea’s role as sagacious councilor to the gods (line 12), recalling line 1
generally, and an affirmation of the life giving power of his authoritative, incan-
tatory word (line 13). This last line of the hymn is the first to associate Ea ex-
plicitly with magic. The power here attributed to Ea’s “incantation of life,”
namely, that it keeps the moribund from death, anticipates the phrase’s appear-
ance later in the petitions (lines 24 and 26) and segues nicely into the supplica-
tion section of the prayer, which is centered on the supplicant’s desire for a
healthy, long life (line 17).
The supplication section of the prayer is dominated by two motifs, effective
speech (lines 14–20) and release from witchcraft (lines 21–28), each of which
provide a perspective on the over-arching theme of the prayer: life. In lines 14–
20 effective speech is first requested from Ea (14–16). The supplicant wants Ea
to give the order so that they may be restored, their speech be heard, and they
achieve favorable things. Line 17 follows with a strong expression of the suppli-
cant’s desire for life. Note the imperative, the last one in the prayer, followed by
the precative. This line announces the prayer’s central theme at its most general
level and anticipates the specific requests of line 28 (at the end of the second
half of the supplication section). Lines 18–19 then turn to the issue of the sup-
plicant’s speech and desire for it to be acceptable to their personal deities and to
influence the actions of both god and king. The juxtaposition of lines 17 and 18–
19 suggest that “life” is inextricably united to the issue of social acceptance and
5
For an insightful treatment of this section of the prayer and its anticipation of the final prayer’s
concluding praise, see Hunt, 47–59.230standing. The final petition of this first half of the supplication section mentions
the instruments of speech, mouth and tongue, and requests their intercession.
The second half of the supplication section is dominated by the supplicant’s
concern for release from witchcraft. In lines 21–23 the supplicant begins with a
request that any evil machinations not approach. In lines 24–25, using similar
language as in lines 21–23 (lines 22 and 24b are identical), the supplicant re-
quests that the machinations (that apparently have arrived) depart. Then in lines
26–27 the supplicant requests the release of the bonds of witchcraft, which im-
plies they actually have the supplicant in their grip. Just as the evil intensifies in
lines 21–27 so too do the supplicant’s appeals to authorities that can counter
them: Ea’s incantation is cited in lines 24 and 26 and Ea’s recruitment of Mar-
duk, his son and traditional assistant in some forms of incantations (see the
comments), is requested in line 27. The end result for all of these requests comes
out only in line 28: that the supplicant’s body be free of illness.
The prayer does not conclude with the typical line or two in which the sup-
plicant promises to praise the deity. Rather, it ends with three lines that present
a unique arrangement of several traditional phrases of praise in which the gods
are the actors. 6
Despite the fact that there is only a single line of ritual instructions pre-
served on one manuscript, Mayer’s MS A, we know that Ea 1a, as with several
other shuilla-prayers, was incorporated into various ritual complexes as a pre-
scribed prayer. For example, its incipit is cited in a royal investiture ritual, 7 a
universal namburbi handbook (SpBTU II, no. 18, rev. 27), 8 and part of Bīt rimki
(see Zimmern, BBR 26 iii 45). 9
6
See Mayer, UFBG, 327–40 for this form of ending generally and 337 for the unique arrange-
ment of the various elements in Ea 1a specifically. Mayer’s MS F expands the praise to four lines
by incorporating another traditional phrase (see 446, n.21[1]).

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer on the tablet. It is not a part of the prayer itself. LUGAL = šarru, “king.” Nēmequ,
“wisdom.” Banû, “to create, to build.” Tašīmtu, “prudence, practical intelligence, discern-
ment.” One might choose to translate the genitives in this line adjectivally. Thus, e.g.,
“king of wisdom” may be rendered “wise king.” The hymnic introduction begins with epi-
thets befitting the Mesopotamian god of wisdom.
šiptu: šar nēmeqi bānû tašīmti
Line 2: Massû, “leader, expert,” like many other terms in the hymnic introduction, is
commonly used to describe rulers and deities (see CAD M/1, 327–28). Ṣīru, “exalted, su-
preme, august.” (W)usmu, “someone or something worthy, suitable,” is another term used
to describe both gods and kings (see AHw, 1497). Usum is the bound form of the noun. É-
zu-ab, “House of the Abzu,” is the Sumerian name of Ea’s temple in Eridu, his original
home town. The Abzu (Sum.; Akk. Apsû), is Ea’s residence, located in the subterranean
fresh waters (see, e.g., Enūma eliš I 71).
massû ṣīru usum E-abzu
Line 3: d EN . LÍL . BÀN . DA = Enlilbanda, “little Enlil,” a common epithet for Ea. Hunt,
after noting three texts that equate Sum. bàn-da with Akk. tašīmtu, translates the epithet as
“Enlil of expertise,” that is, Ea is the ultimate authority within the sphere of wisdom (30–
32, and n.39). He sees this epithet as connecting line 3 back to the use of tašīmtu in line 1
(24–25). Itpēšu, “wise, expert,” is an adjective used to describe kings and deities (see CAD
I/J, 299). Karūbu, “honored one, reverently greeted one.” This word is only attested with
deities.
Enlilbanda itpēšu karūbu
Line 4: Uršānu, “hero, warrior” (see AHw, 1434 for other references with kings and
gods). ERI . DU 10 = Eridu, Ea’s home town. The case vowel on uršānu indicates that it is not2325. EN é-[engur-r]a ṣu-lul

bound to Eridu; thus, the toponym is functioning adverbially, indicating the hero’s place of
origin. ABGAL (NUN-ME) = apkallu, “sage.” This term is often used of gods (e.g., Ea and
Marduk) as well as special humans, such as Adapa and the other antediluvian sages (see J.
C. Greenfield, “Apkallu,” DDD, 72–74). Igigû is a general name for the gods of heaven, in
contrast to Anunnakkū, who are the gods of the netherworld (see Black and Green, 106;
Enūma eliš VI 69 gives the Igigû as three hundred in number and the Anunnakkū six hun-
dred; contradicting this, VI 39–44 number both groups as three hundred).
uršānu Eridu apkal Igigî
Line 5: EN = bēlu, “lord.” É-engur-ra, “House of Fresh Waters,” is another Sumerian
name for Ea’s temple in Eridu. Ṣulūlu, “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor of divine
or royal protection (see CAD Ṣ, 243). É-u 6 -nir, the Sumerian name of Ea’s ziggurrat at
Eridu ( U 6 . NIR is the logogram for Akk. ziqqurratu, “temple tower”). The parallelism between
bēlu and ṣulūlu in this line mutually illuminates the meanings of these two terms. The epi-
thets here and in the next few lines reflect Ea’s status as the Mesopotamian god of water.
bēl E-engura ṣulūl E-unir
Line 6: Babālu, “to carry, to bring,” is a by-form of (w)abālu. ILLU (A-KAL) = mīlu,
“high water, flood.” Bringing high waters is a positive thing here, as the next word in the
genitive chain, ḪÉ . GÁL = ḫegallu, “prosperity, abundance,” and the second half of the line
explain. Ruššu (D of râšu), “to make rejoice.” ÍD = nāru, “river.” DIDLI is a plural marker
like MEŠ . Notice the parallel participles. Does “rejoicing rivers” refer to the sound of faster
moving water in the river beds (see likewise, Hunt, 36)?
bābil mīl ḫegalli murīš nāri
Line 7: Tâmtu, “sea, lake, large body of water.” The noun appears here as a fp abso-
lute form (without case ending). Whether there is a grammatical (rather than, e.g., met-
rical) purpose for the absolute form is unclear. Ṣuṣû, “reed thicket.” Reed thickets, espe-
cially prominent in the marshlands of the south, teemed with animals and plants that
humans in ancient Mesopotamia could use to their advantage for both food and raw mate-
rials. Eridu was located near the marshes. Dešû, “to let prosper, to provide someone or
something bountifully with something.” ḪÉ . NUN = nuḫšu, “plenty, abundance.” The text
continues to praise Ea’s watery beneficence in this line.
ina tâmāt u ṣuṣê tudešši nuḫša
Line 8: Note the tight grammatical parallelism with line 7: prepositional phrase be-
ginning with ina, a second person verb, then the direct object. The longer prepositional
phrase in line 7 is balanced here by a genitive chain for the direct object. Qerbetu, “envi-
rons, meadowland.” Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to create, to produce.” ZI = napištu, “life, subsist-
ence, livelihood.” UN . MEŠ = nišū, “people.” Ea’s beneficial creative activity extends beyond
the watery areas to include the meadows. Mayer’s MS D identifies the “life” of the people𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : E A 1 A

Line 9: Anu, the sky god, was the high god of the Mesopotamian pantheon but was a
deus otiosus. d EN . LÍL = Ellil, god of the wind and another of the high gods, was the active
head of the pantheon until he was replaced by Marduk, probably in the late second mil-
lennium. Ḫadiš, “joyfully.” Râšu, “to rejoice, to exult.” Rīšū is a 3mp predicative. The ob-
ject of the verb is the cause for rejoicing.
Anu u Ellil ḫadiš rīšūka
Line 10: For the Anunnakkī, see line 4 above. Māḫāzu, “shrine, cult center.” Karābu,
“to bless, greet (with a blessing).” The Anunnakkī are mentioned, whose place in the neth-
erworld was the extreme opposite of the heavenly abodes of Anu and Ellil.
Anunnakkī ina māḫāzīšunu ikarrabūka
Line 11: KUR = mātu, “land, earth.” Šitmuru (Gt of šamāru), “to praise.” Zikru, “utter-
ance, command.” Kabtu, “heavy, weighty, important, honored.” Between heaven (line 9)
and the netherworld (line 10) are the people. Gods and humans both laud Ea.
nišū māti ištammarā zikirka kabta
Line 12: DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” GAL . MEŠ = rabûtu (mp), “great.” Nadānu, “to give.”
The –md– in the middle of the verb is the result of nasalization (–dd– changes to –md–).
Milku, “counsel, advice.” As a god of wisdom, Ea is especially suited to counsel the gods.
(But see the similar line in the prayer to Sin, page 392.)
ana ilī rabûti tanamdin milka
Line 13: In the last line of the opening hymn the prayer invokes the deity’s primary
name for the first time (see also line 24). Tû, “incantation, spell.” TI (. LA ) = balāṭu, “life,
health” (see also line 17). Lā, “not,” is used here with the durative verb to form a prohibi-
tion (“he shall not die”). Mâtu, “to die.” LÚ . ÚŠ = mītu, literally means “dead,” but it seems
the word sometimes means someone who is as good as dead but has not ceased bodily
function. Foster (643) translates the word with “moribund,” which captures its meaning
nicely. The effectiveness of Ea’s incantatory word is well-known. See, e.g., Enūma eliš I 62–
63.

Line 14: The prayer turns now to petition, as the two imperatives indicate. Ullû (D of
elû), “to raise up.” Rēšu, “head.” When a social superior raised a person’s head, it meant
taking notice of the person’s lowly condition and restoring them to their former status or
position. Nabû, “to name, to call,” with šumu, “name,” as its object (the nominative case
ending often occurs where the accusative is expected in SB Akkadian) means “to summon,
to call a person (to exercise a function), to appoint a person to an office” (see CAD N/1,
35–37). The supplicant is asking Ea to change their lowly situation, whatever it was. May-
er’s MS E inserts a two line self-presentation formula, naming a certain Balāṭa-ēreš, and a
standardized lament at this point in the prayer (see Mayer, UFBG, 50–52, 102–3, and 444,
n.6[1]).
ulli rēšīya ibi šumu
Line 15: Qibītu, “speech, command.” The ending of the first word bears the locative-
adverbial –um, which is the equivalent of ina (see line 16), and a 2ms pronominal suffix.
(The m of the locative assimilates into the k of the suffix; –mk– becomes –kk–.) Nešmû (N
of šemû), “to be heard.” Zikru, see line 11. Whether the supplicant is asking that the words
of the prayer specifically or their words in broader society generally be heard, the line
demonstrates how effective human speech is founded on divine decree (divine effective
speech). As if to underline this point, the verbs in this and the next line have changed from
imperatives (as in lines 14 and 16) to precatives.
qibītukka liššemû zikrūya
Line 16: Qību, “command, pronouncement.” SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f), “favora-
ble, good.” Kašādu, “to accomplish, to reach, to achieve.” Ana often accompanies kašādu,
indicating what or where one is reaching or achieving. The results of effective speech are
also requested: favorable things.
ina qībīka ana damiqti lukšud
Line 17: Šarāku, “to give, to grant, to bestow.” TI . LA , see line 13. Bâru, “to stay firm,
to remain in good health.” A variant, lul-bur, in MS E may derive the verb from labāru, “to
be(come) old.” But we would expect lul-bir, if that were the case. Perhaps we should read
MS E as lu ! -bur or lu 5? -bur here (see Seux, 277, n.20). Ana dāri, “forever and ever,” should
not be taken too literally. The supplicant is not asking for immortality; rather, they want to
live a very, very long time. With this petition, the supplicant reaches the very root of their
desire: life.

Line 18: Atmû, “speech, manner of speaking.” UGU = eli. d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” Ṭâbu
eli X, “to be pleasing, to be good to someone.” If Ebeling’s copy of MS A [= KAR 59] is
accurate, the above suggested restoration is better than Mayer’s LUGAL ; see likewise Foster,
643 and Seux, 277, n.22. Mayer’s MS E contains a variant: ilū u šarru, “gods and king,” for
which see line 19. The prayer returns to the theme of effective speech (see line 15), but
now lays emphasis on the supplicant’s personal deities. They wish the deities to be pleased
with what they say.
atmêya liṭīb eli ili u ištari
Line 19: Qabêya is a G inf. with a 1cs pronominal suffix. Epēšu, “to do, to make.”
Again the text brings up effective speech but now in terms of action rather than just recep-
tion (as in line 18). The supplicant explicitly requests that both god and king do whatever
they say.
ilu u šarru ša qabêya līpušū
Line 20: Pû, “mouth.” Lišānu, “tongue.” Pû u lišānu are metonyms for intercessory
speech or prayer (see CAD L, 211). Šutēmuqu (Št of emēqu), “to pray, to supplicate” (see
CAD Š/3, 400–401). The dative 1cs suffix on the verb indicates the beneficiary of the in-
tercession: the supplicant.
pû u lišānu lištēmiqūni
Line 21: What I have arranged as a single line here is actually composed of parts of
the previous and following lines (according to MS A) in Mayer’s edition. The first half of
our line is uncertain, though a vetitive, paralleling the second half, seems quite likely and
a verb from qerēbu plausible (see Seux, 277, n.25). KUR = kašādu, see line 16. The line
supplies the verbs for the following two lines that describe what the supplicant wants to
stay away.
ayy-iqribanni ayy-ikšudanni
Line 22: Mimma, “anything, everything.” Lemnu, “evil, bad, unfavorable.” NU DÙG . GA
= lā ṭābu, “not good, hostile, unfavorable.” The supplicant first makes a broad statement
concerning undesirable things generally before turning to a more specific problem in line
23.

Line 23: Šunu, means “them,” but is probably best taken as emphasizing the following
word. Upīšu, “magical procedure,” usually occurs in the plural (just as šunu would lead us
to expect). But here it lacks the mp ending –ū; thus, it is a singular bound form. The word
governs the following two paired genitives. Kaššāpu, “warlock.” Kaššaptu, “witch.” As hap-
pens frequently in prayers, the machinations of the anti-social (black) magic of the witch
and warlock are introduced. In this case, they seem to be the main reason for the suppli-
cant’s problems. Mayer’s MS F further defines the upīšū of the witch and warlock as
kišpīšunu ruḫêšunu rusêšunu, “their witchcraft, black magic, and sorcery.” These three se-
mantically-related terms occur together rather frequently in witchcraft contexts.
u šunu upīš kaššāpi u kaššapti
Line 24: Tû, see line 13. TIN = balāṭu, “life, health.” The line reprises the invocation
used in line 13 (absent in Mayer’s MS F). This line reiterates its concern for the general evil
mentioned in line 22. The main verb of the sentence occurs in the next line of the text.
Ea ina têka ša balāṭi mimma lemnu mimma lā ṭābu
Line 25: Nêʾu, means “to turn back.” Irtu (pl. irātu), “breast, chest,” bears a 3mp pro-
nominal suffix (lacking the final vowel). The consonant cluster –tš– becomes –ss–. The
idiom irta nêʾu means “to turn back, to depart, to withdraw.” Although the supplicant has
already requested that nothing unfavorable reach them, they request now that Ea use his
incantatory speech to deflect the evil.
linēʾū irāssun
Line 26: Riksu, “binding, knot, bond,” here refers to the evil actions of the warlock
and witch. Puṭṭuru (D of paṭāru), “to loosen, to undo a knot.” Šiptu, “incantation, ritual
wording.” The “incantation of Eridu” stands for Ea. Again the supplicant appeals to the
effective word of Ea. The power of the supplicant’s enemies seems to be growing stronger.
First the supplicant wished that nothing evil would approach (21–23). Then the supplicant
requested that any and all evil be turned back (lines 24–25). Now it seems the evil powers
of the warlock and witch have a hold on the supplicant and they need to be undone.
rikis kaššāpi u kaššapti lipaṭṭir šipti ša Eridu
Line 27: ḪUL . MEŠ = lemnūtu, “evil things” (mp). For ABGAL , see line 4. Drawing on
previous lines, the supplicant now requests that Ea use Marduk, his son, to help the suppli-
cant get free of the magical machinations of the witch and warlock. This may allude to a
common motif in Sumerian incantations in which Ea and Marduk cooperate explicitly to
fight the problem addressed in the incantation (see Adam Falkenstein, Die Haupttypen der𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : E A 1 A

Line 28: Ebēbu, “to be(come) pure, bright,” but here “to be(come) clear (of illness).”
Minâtu, the plural of minītu, “limbs, body,” is often used in parallel to mešrêtu, “limbs” (see
CAD M/2, 88). Ṭâbu eli X here (as opposed to its meaning in line 18) means “to be in good
condition, to be sound, to be healthy.” A first person reference is finally mentioned explic-
itly again, absent in the prayer since line 21.
lībibā minâtūya mešrêtūya elīya liṭībā
Line 29: AN = šamû, “the heavens.” Ḫadû, “to be joyful.” The object supplies the
cause for joy. Râšu, “to rejoice.” See line 9 where Anu rejoices, using very similar words.
The parallel use of the heavens and the Apsû creates a merism: the entire universe is en-
couraged to give praise to Ea for his beneficence to the supplicant. This line begins a cre-
scendo of cosmic praise that concludes the prayer, replacing the otherwise ubiquitous
personal promise of praise: dalīlīka ludlul, “let me resound your praises.”

Line 30: Etelliš, “as a lord, in a lordly fashion.” The first sign of the word is uncertain.
Šūlulu (Š of alālu), “to celebrate, to laud.” The population of the heavens and the nether-
world (see line 29) are now drawn in to praise Ea. How etelliš functions in the sentence is
unclear. Does it describe the great gods (“in a lordly fashion they laud you”) or does it
further define the praise the great gods offer to Ea (“they laud you as a lord”)? The word is
almost always attested with verbs that deal with the body in motion or repose (standing,
going, entering, or sitting) and is most often attested with alāku (see CAD E, 380–81). Our
instance would seem to be the exception. The adjectival use of the cognate etellu as a de-
scription of speech (CAD E, 382), however, suggests a basis for understanding the use of
the adverb here with a speech-related verb. Moreover, in every instance of etelliš the word
modifies the subject’s action, designated by the verb. It seems most likely therefore that
the adverb is to be attached to the great gods’ activity of praise here. Mayer’s MS E con-
cludes the line with ilū rabûti libbaka liṭibbū, “may the great gods please your heart,” and
his MS F offers ilū ša kiššat likrubū-KI ! (for –ka) ilū rabûti libbaka liṭib-ŠU ! (for –bū), “may the
gods of the totality bless you, may the great gods please your heart.”

Line 31: Dumqu, “good fortune.” The crescendo of praise grows more specific, naming

Line 32: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is
directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the
wording of a lifted-hand to Enlilbanda,” i.e., Ea. One MS of the text indicates the prayer is
directed at d en-ki, the Sumerian name for Ea. Another MS shows that it was directed to
d
amar-utu, Marduk. Unfortunately, this latter MS does not preserve anything before our
line 25, so we cannot ascertain how the text was adjusted to fit Marduk.
Line 33: The ritual instructions comprise a single line, preserved in only one MS . The
instructions begin without any indicator (such as DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual,” which is
used very frequently). The phrase we have here in line 33 is quite stereotypical and com-
monly attached to shuillas. It probably serves only as the catchphrase to a fuller ritual,
which the exorcist would recall and perform probably from memory (see Mayer, UFBG,
119, n.3). Lū . . . lū, “either . . . or.” KEŠDA = riksu, “ritual arrangement, assemblage of
offerings” (compare the usage here to those in lines 26 and 27 above). NÍG . NA = nignakku,
“incense burner.” DÙ = epēšu, “to do, to make.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Although our prayer offers several interesting possibilities for comparative
purposes, we focus here on two: the “hand-lifting” gesture accompanied by a
formal address found in all shuilla-prayers and the BH equivalents to the suppli-
cant’s first petitions in line 14.
Lines 1–12 of our prayer to Ea comprise a lengthy hymnic introduction,
which is of course a typical feature of shuilla-prayers. As discussed in the gen-
eral introduction, the hand-lifting gesture along with its verbal component of
honored address was a complex formal gesture of greeting in ancient Mesopota-
mia based on a master-servant relationship. When used with prayer, the complex
of gesture and formal address (i.e., hymnic introduction) “emphasized the com-
municative gesture . . . , a salutation signaling recognition of a reciprocal but
asymmetrical relationship between client and deity” (see page 35 of the general
introduction). Do we find a similar adaptation of such a greeting in the prayers
of the Hebrew Bible? Although the Bible does not show evidence of a special
kind of “lifted-hand” ritual-prayer, the Hebrew Bible does preserve attestations
in its prayers of the hand raising gesture and the formal mode of address (of
varying lengths) similar to the shuilla’s hymnic introduction. In light of the
comparative evidence, these texts display another facet of ancient Israel’s mas-
ter-servant model of divine-human relations.
Formal address dominated by praise is found at the beginning of several
biblical prayers in which individuals or a representative group pray on behalf of
the community. Note, for example, the brief hymnic introduction to a penitential𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : E A 1 A
239
prayer in Dan 9:4 and the longer ones to communal laments in Pss 44:2–9 and
89:2–19. Nehemiah 9, a penitential prayer like Dan 9, in which Levites stand
before the community and petition Yahweh to forgive the people’s sin, is a par-
ticularly interesting example. The prayer begins in v. 5b and ends in v. 37; the
introductory hymn occupies vv. 5b–32a! At the start of the prayer the Levites
address Yahweh in a manner that recalls the significance of Akkadian karābu
(BH cognate: ‫)ברכ‬ 1 to the hand-raising greeting (see page 35 of the general in-
troduction): ‫ינוּ‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ַ ‫רוְּך‬ ‫בּ‬,
“You are blessed, O Yahweh, our god” (v. 5b). 2
The hymn then goes on to praise Yahweh’s name, uniqueness, creative and sus-
taining power, and especially his historical dealings with Israel, from the exodus
to the speaker’s present day. This long account of the history between Yahweh
and Israel also brings out Yahweh’s character: his compassion, long-suffering,
forgiveness, and willingness to discipline his people rather than to forsake them.
The entire hymn is prelude to the relatively brief petition in vv. 32b–37.
Although we see the formal address in this long opening hymn, we of course
do not see the hand raising gesture. The opening statement about Yahweh’s
blessedness, however, may be enough to suggest hand-raising lies in the pre-
sumed background for both the author and their early readers. This is a plausi-
ble presumption in light of passages like Ps 134:1–2, “Bless Yahweh, all (you)
servants of Yahweh . . . lift up your hands . . . bless Yahweh!” (‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֲ ‫בּ‬ ָ
‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֲ ‫וּב‬
. . . ‫ם‬ ‫כ‬ ֶ ‫ד‬ ֵ ְ‫אוּ־י‬ ‫שׂ‬ ְ . . . ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫ד‬ ֵ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫ל־ע‬
‫)כּ‬,
and Ps 63:5, “I bless you . . . I lift up
my hands” (‫י‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ֶ . . . ‫ָך‬ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ב‬ ֲ ‫)א‬.
3 As these texts suggest, the hand-raising gesture
is closely aligned with offering blessing (or praise) to the deity. It is also associ-
ated with petitionary prayer in other passages. Note, for example, how Ezra lifts
his hands in prayer (‫י‬ ‫פּ‬ ַ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ‫שׂ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫)א‬
in Ezra 9:5, a third penitential prayer (though
this prayer lacks a hymnic introduction). Solomon does the same in 1 Kgs 8:22
( ‫יו‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫כּ‬ ַ ‫ֹשׂ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫פ‬ ְ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ), where introductory praise accompanies the gesture (vv. 23–24) and
precedes the petition (vv. 25ff. ). 4
If our comparative material is at all instructive, we should look at each of
these biblical contexts in similar terms as the audience model described for the
Mesopotamian shuilla-prayer: a supplicant reaches out to a social superior for
1
Tawil, ALCBH, 58.
This reading, which assumes continuity between vv. 5 and 6, requires a slight emendation to
the MT , which reads: ‫ם‬ ‫יכ‬ ֶ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ת־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ר‬ ֲ ‫ב‬,
“Bless Yahweh, your god.” See H. G. M. Williamson,
Ezra, Nehemiah (WBC 16; Waco: Word, 1985), 303–4. For a different understanding, see Joseph
Blenkinsopp, Ezra-Nehemiah: A Commentary (OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1988), 296,
301.

Note the related issue of lifting hands as part of conferring a blessing on people in, e.g., 1 Kgs
8:54 and Lev 9:22.
4
See also, e.g., Exod 9:29, 33, 1 Kgs 8:38, and Ps 28:2 (‫י‬ ‫יָד‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫א‬ ִ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ָ‫נ‬ ‫)בּ‬
for the gesture in a context of
supplication. The hand-raising gesture is also reflected farther afield in 1 Tim 2:8. For a fuller
discussion of the various phrases in Biblical Hebrew that denote the hand-raising gesture and
reflection about how each relates specifically to praise and/or supplication, see Mayer I. Gruber,
Aspects of Nonverbal Communication in the Ancient Near East (Studia Pohl 12/1; Rome: Biblical
Institute Press, 1980), 25–44.
2240help, greeting the one petitioned via a conventional gesture and formal address
that recognizes the superior’s higher position in relation to the supplicant. In this
manner, the supplicant hopes to establish a favorable relationship with the one
petitioned and thereby obtain a positive answer to their request. It is interesting
that we do not see the hand-lifting gesture or lengthy formal address in either
the dingirshadibba-prayers to personal gods or biblical laments of the individual.
For reflections on this latter point, see page 442.
In the prayer’s first line of petitions (line 14) the supplicant says, “raise my
head, call (my) name!” (ulli rēšīya ibi šumu). These two idioms have equivalents
in BH. Before we make any comparisons, however, we should recognize that “to
raise the head” and “to call a name” have more than one meaning in both Akka-
dian and BH (see CAD N/2, 107–8 and HALOT, 1164–65 for the former and CAD
N/1, 33–37 and HALOT, 1129 for the latter). The sense of rēša ullû in our Akka-
dian prayer is something like “to take notice with favorable intention.” The same
sense for the BH cognate phrase ‫ֹאשׁ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫נשׂא‬ occurs in 2 Kgs 25:27 ( Jer 52:31),
where Jehoichan is shown mercy by the Babylonian king Evil-merodach, and
Gen 40:13, where Joseph informs the Pharaoh’s chief cupbearer that the Phar-
aoh will restore him to his former position. 5 Šuma nabû in our prayer has the
sense of summoning or appointing a person for a particular position or standing.
The same meaning is found in the BH idiom ‫ם‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫קרא‬. See, for example, Exod
31:2, 35:30, Josh 21:9 (where it is used as a means to allocate land; see also 1
Chron 6:50), Isa 40:26, 43:1, 45:3, 4, and Isa 49:1, where the idiom is broken up
across the line’s poetic parallelism. These idioms demonstrate once again the
significant cultural (including religious) continuity between ancient Israel and
ancient Mesopotamia despite their many differences.
5
Note, however, that the idiom “to raise the head” is also used later in the narrative (Gen 40:19,
31) in other senses, rather literally, as in “the Pharaoh will raise your head from upon you”
(‫יָך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫;מ‬
v. 19), and in the idiomatic sense, “to summon” (v. 31).

A Shuilla: Gula 1a
A LAN L ENZI
G ULA :
Gula was a mother goddess from the Babylonian city of Isin and one of the
high gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon. According to various traditions Gula
was the daughter of An and Urash, the wife of Ninurta or Pabilsag, and the
mother of Damu and Ninazu. Gula is attested already in third millennium texts
(perhaps as early as the ED period in Fara) and persists in the Mesopotamian
pantheon until Hellenistic times. By the OB period Gula had already been identi-
fied with and worshipped as the goddesses Ninisina, Nintinugga, Ninkarrak,
Gunura, and Baba, among others. As the azugallatu, “the chief physician,” Gula
was closely associated with healing and the patron deity of the asû, “physician.”
She was also the patron god of dogs and associated with the dog in iconogra-
phy. 1 Given her power over disease, Gula was sometimes invoked in curse for-
mulae to bring illness upon transgressors (see, e.g., SAA 2, no. 6, §52).
Gula’s main temple, É-gal-maḫ, “the exalted palace,” was in Isin, but she
had temples and shrines—sometimes more than one—in many other cities (e.g.,
Ashur, Babylon, Borsippa, Nippur, Lagash, Larsa, Umma, Ur, and Uruk). Excava-
tions at cultic sites in Isin, Nippur, and Sippar have revealed dog and human
figurines as well as models of body parts. 2 Some of the dog figurines seem to be
apotropaic or petitionary in nature, but others were clearly placed as thanksgiv-
ing votives to Gula for help received. 3 The human figurines probably represent
individuals. The varied hand placement of these figurines upon their body may
have been intended to indicate the part of the sufferer’s body that was afflicted.
The temples of Gula were also a center for storing and copying texts associated
with the healing professions. Tablets have been found in her temple at Isin, and
colophons mention tablets being copied from an original stored at a temple of
Gula (see, e.g., Hunger, BAK, nos. 199[d], 203[k], 380).
1
Gula’s temple is called the É-ur-gi 7 -ra, “the dog house,” in some texts, and thirty-three dog
burials were uncovered near Gula’s temple in Isin. See Avalos, 210–12 and references there.

Ibid., 202–10.

See the text cited by Avalos, ibid., 216.
243244Gula’s star was Lyra and her canine representation is associated with our
constellation Hercules. One of the most important first-millennium texts associ-
ated with the goddess is a two-hundred-line hymn that alternates between a
description of Gula and her spouse, Ninurta. 4
T HE P RAYER :
The prayer may be divided into three sections: the introduction (lines 1–
10), the petition section (lines 11–24), and the promise of praise (line 25).
Lines 1–10 form the introductory section of the prayer. An invocation and a
mere three epithets (line 1) lead directly into what Mayer calls the “turning”
(Hinwendung; see UFBG, 122–49) in lines 2–3. Here the supplicant explicitly
seeks the goddess’s attention with first person verbs and demands (note the im-
peratives) that she be present and listen to the prayer. The supplicant gives rea-
sons for turning to Gula in lines 4–6. Since all of these reasons concern the func-
tional domain of the goddess (and recall hymnic epithets found elsewhere), we
may also consider these lines a kind of implicit praise of the goddess, continuing
what the prayer started in line 1. Lines 7–8 reprise the invocation and praise of
the goddess with three epithets, repeating or paralleling line 1. These lines lead
into lines 9–10, where the supplicant turns to the deity again, using first person
verbs, and demands her attention, using imperatives (compare lines 2–3). The
mixture of invocation, hymnic elements, and explicit requests for the goddess’s
attention prepares the way for the petition section of the prayer in lines 11–24.
The petition section can be divided into three parts, lines 11–19, which con-
cern the angry personal and city deities; lines 20–22, which deal with Marduk;
and lines 23–24, which make a final general plea. The supplicant begins in lines
11–12 by wishing to send Gula to intervene on their behalf with their angry per-
sonal and city deities (the lušpurka formula; see UFBG, 236–39). Although the
problem of angry deities is worked into this first petition proper rather than
stated as an independent complaint, its ramifications are clearly expressed in the
complaint that follows in lines 13–14: the supplicant is afraid due to evil oracles
and dreams. Having expressed a desire to send Gula, the supplicant now spells
out in lines 15–19 exactly what they want her to do. By the power of her divine
word, the supplicant requests that she restore their troubled relationship with
their protective deities. As if to emphasize its importance, the supplicant prefac-
es this second petition proper with another reprised invocation in line 15 (see
line 1 and compare line 7). The same invocation is repeated in line 20, the open-
ing of the second part of the prayer’s petition section.
In a somewhat surprising turn of events, the supplicant now requests that
Gula also intercede with Marduk (line 21–22a) and put in a good word on the
supplicant’s behalf (line 22b). The precise reason for this second intercessory
4

245
petition is unclear, but Gula’s role as an intermediary goddess is attested else-
where. One could imagine the cooperation between the human asû, “physician,”
and āšipu, “exoricist,” suggested the cooperation between Gula, patron of physi-
cians, and Marduk, a god closely associated with magic. 5 In any case, the com-
parison of Gula to a personal god in line 3 has foreshadowed her intermediary
role here.
The petition section ends with one final, general petition for Gula to protect,
forgive, and provide well-being for the supplicant. This last petition leads into
the promise of praise in line 25.
Two major elements in the prayer give its text a sense of unity. The first
among these is the repeated invocation in structurally significant locations, lines
1, 15, and 20. 6 The latter two instances introduce a part of the prayer in which
the supplicant asks Gula to intercede with another divine power on their behalf.
The repetition of the invocation in these places maintains the prayer’s focus on
Gula, even while Gula’s attention is directed elsewhere. Another unifying ele-
ment is the thematic prevalence of mercy and intercession. This is most obvious-
ly manifested in the repetition of the word rēmēnītû/rēmēnû, “merciful,” in lines
1, 7, and 21. But one can also see the theme in the “hem of the garment” image-
ry of line 3, the string of infinitives in lines 5–6 (bulluṭu, šullumu, eṭēru, gamālu,
and šūzubu), 7 and the two-fold use of the idiom abbūta ṣabātu, “to intercede,” in
lines 20 (as an epithet for the goddess) and 22 (as an imperative).
Although the prayer is directed to Gula in the majority of MSS , three of May-
er’s MSS (B, E, and H) direct the prayer to a different goddess, Belet-ili (Bēlet-ilī).
These same three MSS also preserve an attalû formula within the prayer’s text,
though at different places in each. These variations in addressee and the content
demonstrate once again how shuilla-prayers could be adapted for various ritual
purposes. In addition to this, recent work on Bīt salāʾ mê has placed our prayer
in the ninth section of that ritual series among a number of other shuilla-prayers
(see Ambos).

For the intermediary role of Gula, see Avalos, 187–91, who mentions the parallel between the
cooperation of human ritual officials and that of the gods.

Note the use in line 24, near the end of the prayer, of nouns cognate to two of these verbs
(gimillu, “requital,” cognate to gamālu and balāṭu, “life,” cognate to bulluṭu).246E SSENTIAL B IBLIOGRAPHY :

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” This word marks the beginning of the prayer. It is
not a part of the prayer itself. Three MSS (Mayer’s B, E, and H) direct this same prayer to
the goddess Belet-ili simply by substituting her name for Gula’s. GAŠAN = bēltu, “lady”
(but also šarratu, “queen”). Šurbūtu (fs), šurbû (m), “exalted, supreme,” is often used to
describe deities and their epithets (see CAD Š/3, 341–42). The Š stem verbal adjective is
used here as an elative (i.e., superlative), “most exalted.” The form is not to be confused
with the infrequently occurring noun šurbûtu, “greatness, exaltedness.” The TUM sign may
also be read as tu 4 , indicating SB Akkadian’s loss of mimation. AMA = ummu, “mother.”
Rēmēnītû (f), rēmēnû (m), “merciful,” is also frequently used to describe deities and their
epithets (see CAD R, 238). Compare this epithet to Marduk’s on page 296. (W)ašābu, “to
dwell, to sit.” The participle is functioning substantively, in apposition to the other epi-
thets in the line. AN = šamû, “heavens,” is always plural. KÙ = ellu, “pure, clear.”
Gula bēltu šurbūtu ummu rēmēnītû āšibat šamê ellūti
Line 2: šasû, “to call out to, to shout.” The G preterite form of the verb, išsi (3cs),
often becomes ilsi in later Akkadian. Alsi is a 1cs preterite. MU = 1cs pronominal suffix.
Izuzzu, “to stand.” The suffixed –m on the verb is the ventive morpheme. Šemû, “to hear, to
listen to.” Yâti, “to me.” The supplicant interrupts the string of epithets to request Gula’s
attention directly with performative verbs, the speaking of which executes their ritual
actions (i.e., “I hereby call to you”). The imperatives demand Gula’s presence and atten-
tion. This and the following line illustrate a common rhetorical move in Mesopotamian
prayers.

Line 3: šeʾû, “to seek out.” Saḫāru, “to turn.” GIM = kīma, “like, as.” TÚG . SÍG = sissik-
tu, “fringe, hem.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.” d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” Ṣabātu, “to seize.” The pray-
er builds on alsīki in line 2 with another three 1cs performative verbs. The last verb must
be understood metaphorically, unless we are to imagine the supplicant standing before the
divine image. Seizing the hem of a social superior’s garment was a symbolic gesture, in the
present case, of supplication (see CAD Ṣ, 18 and the discussion of the gesture on page 426,
line 15).
ešēki asḫurki kīma sissikti ilīya u ištarīya sissiktaki aṣbat
Line 4: Aššum, “because.” Dīnu, “(legal) case,” is the object of the infinitive (despite
the written case vowel). Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” EŠ . BAR = purussû, “(legal) decision.”
Parāsu, “to cut, to decide.” Both phrases in the line are cognate accusative constructions
(i.e., the verb and its object derive from the same root), creating a rhythmic and allitera-
tive line. Render both phrases idiomatically. The supplicant lays out in lines 4–6 the spe-
cific reasons for turning to Gula, a god who has the power to judge. Although these lines
provide supporting evidence for the supplicant’s turning, they use verbs that appear in
various hymnic epithets. They therefore should also be considered implicit praise for the
deity.
aššum dīni dâni purussâ parāsi
Line 5: Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to heal, to revive, to spare, to provide support for.”
Šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to keep well, to heal.” The infinitives are functioning as gerunds.
Bašû, “to be, to exist.” Itti, “with.” How would one translate “they are with you” idiomati-
cally? The supplicant has turned to Gula because she also has the power to heal and re-
store people to health.
aššum bulluṭu u šullumu bašû ittīki
Line 6: Eṭēru, “to save, to take away.” Gamālu, “to do a favor, to spare,” but see also
page 328. Šūzubu (Š of ezēbu), “to make someone leave, to rescue.” Idû, “to know.” Gula’s
knowledge described in this line is not abstract or theoretical; rather, it is functional. She
knows how to deploy actions that save, spare, and rescue people.
aššum eṭēra gamāla u šūzuba tīde
Line 7: The supplicant repeats the invocation, nearly repeating the first half of the
opening line. Šaqūtu (fs), šaqû (m), “elevated, prominent, sublime,” is often used to de-
scribe deities and their qualities (see CAD Š/2, 17–19). It is a near synonym of the adjec-2488. ina ma-aʾ-du-ti MUL . MEŠ šá-ma-mi

actually read šurbūtu; there is no replacement in these MSS .
Gula bēltu šaqūtu ummu rēmēnītû
Line 8: Maʾdû (maʾdûti, mp), “large quantity, abundance.” MUL . MEŠ = kakkabū,
“stars.” Šamāmū, “heavens,” is a poetical equivalent of šamû. The reprised invocation con-
tinues, providing a semantic parallel to the second half of line 1. “Among the myriad stars
of heaven” is a way of describing Gula in the heavenly realm as she exists among her di-
vine peers. (Deities were associated with stars.)
ina maʾdûti kakkabī šamāmī
Line 9: Kâši, “to you,” is redundant (perhaps emphatic) since the verb that follows it
(saḫāru, see line 3) also has a 2fs dative pronominal suffix. GEŠTU . II = uznā, “ears” (d).
When used with ears or eyes, bašû means “to be fixed on, to be attentive to” (see CDA, 40).
Mayer’s MS H (from Sippar) includes 8 very formulaic lines here (including a self-
presentation formula, the attalû-formula [see UFBG, 100], and a formulaic lament and
petition) in which Shamash-shum-ukin laments (as king, with Marduk and Zarpanitu as his
personal deities) on account of an evil eclipse (see UFBG, 452, n.79(4)).
bēltu kâši asḫurki ibšâki uznāya
Line 10: ZÌ . MAD . GÁ = maṣḫatu, “(a kind of) flour.” Maḫāru, “to accept, to receive.”
Leqû, “to take, to accept.” Unnīnu, “prayer, supplication.” The verb muḫrīnni has two ob-
jects, the one marked by the 1cs pronominal suffix and the word maṣḫata, “flour.” The two
objects should be understood as in apposition (thus, to receive the flour is to receive the
supplicant) and rendered in an idiomatic manner. The line contains a couple of stock
phrases in which the supplicant asks Gula to accept both the offering and the prayer. The
two imperatives in this line hark back to the two in line 2. The imperatives in line 10 pro-
vide the next step in the logical progression begun with the earlier imperatives: “stand
here and listen to me” (line 2) and “receive my flour offering, accept my prayer” (line 10).
One could even suggest that the actions of each imperative are collated via their position
in their respective lines, with the first ones showing movement from one to the other and
likewise the second ones: “stand here, receive my flour offering” (2a, 10a); “listen to me,
accept my prayer” (2b, 10b). Together these requests form a ritual prelude for the personal
and therefore more important petitions (from the supplicant’s perspective) that follow in
the next several lines.
maṣḫata muḫrīnnī-ma leqē unnīnīya
Line 11: Šapāru, “to send.” Zenû (m), zenītu (f), “angry.” The supplicant wants to send
Gula to their personal deities to intercede on their behalf. For a discussion of the personal
god in Mesopotamia, see page 431.

Line 12: URU = ālu, “city.” The words šabsu and kamlu are predicative constructions
in a subordinate clause (note the ša). When the subjunctive –u is added to the 3ms predica-
tive forms (šabis and kamil), the short i-vowels reduce. Both words mean “is angry.” Be-
sides the personal gods, the supplicant also wishes to send Gula to the city god. Mayer’s MS
E includes a fragmentary attalû–formula after this line (see UFBG, 453, n.82(5)).
ana il ālīya ša šabsū-ma kamlu ittīya
Line 13: Ina here means “as a result of, on account of.” Bīru, “the answer received
through divination, an oracle.” Šuttu, “dream.” Given the following verb, both singular
nouns are probably to be understood as collectives. Itaškunu (Ntn of šakānu), “to occur,
arise continually” (said of signs); see CAD B, 265 for a near parallel. The verb is in an
unmarked relative clause (i.e., there is no ša) and does not take a subjunctive ending (–u)
due to the presence of the ventive –am. The text begins a new sentence in line 13, which
gives the reasons for the states of mind described in line 14. Mayer’s MS E includes a one
line self-presentation formula and a truncated attalû-formula here (see UFBG, 453,
n.83(4)); both formulae are similar to what MS H adds after line 9, only they are shorter
here and use generic name and date “placeholders” ( NENNI ).
ina bīri u šutti ittanaškanam-ma
Line 14: Palāḫu, “to fear, to be afraid.” There are two homonymic roots in Akkadian
that have closely related meanings, adāru A or I and B or II (according to the CAD or
CDA). The first means “to be dark, to be worried.” The second means “to be afraid.” De-
termining which root is used in a specific context is difficult sometimes (see CAD A/1,
107–8 and 109). Despite the CAD listing our line under adāru B, its own criteria (A/1,
107–8) would suggest adāru A for our case, in which psychological trauma rather than
religious awe is paramount. The form of the verb is a Gtn, “to be anxious, worried con-
stantly.” The doubled second letter of the root (–dd–) is nasalized in our example, thus
atanamdaru. The final –u is superfluous, perhaps inserted under the influence of the 1cs
predicative ending of the first verb in the line. A subjunctive is not called for.
palḫākū-ma atanamdaru
Line 15: The first part of the line recalls the opening of line 1 in another reprise of the
initial invocation (see also line 7). Amātu (awātum), “word.” Qibītu, “speech, command.”
Ṣīru (m), ṣīrtu (f), “exalted, august.” É-kur was Enlil’s temple in Nippur. Šurbât is a 3fs
predicative related to šurbūtu, “exalted, supreme,” earlier in the line (and in line 1). This
line and the next comprise a long vocative address, directing the wishes (third person
precatives) expressed in lines 17–19 to Gula’s attention. The first ina in this line governs a
rather complex prepositional phrase that includes the rest of line 15 and all of line 16. The
ša introduces a short relative clause that futher defines Gula’s authoritative word.

Line 16: Annu, “consent, approval.” The relative clause modifies Gula’s consent and
grammatically parallels the relative clause in line 15. Kīnu, “firm, true.” NU = lā, “not.”
BAL = enû, “to change, to alter.” The inf. expresses the permanence or unchangeable quali-
ty of the deity’s word (see CAD E, 175), a common motif in Mesopotamian texts.
u annīki kīnim ša lā enû
Line 17: Târu, “to return, to turn back.” Nasḫuru (N of saḫāru), “to turn back, to turn
again with favor to.” Note the ventive on both verbs. The supplicant, having gotten Gula’s
attention in the previous lines, now begins expressing desires of reconciliation with their
angry deities (named earlier in lines 11 and 12).
ilī šabsu litūra ištartī zenītu lissaḫra
Line 18: This line repeats line 12 nearly verbatim.
il ālīya ša šabsū-ma kamlu ittīya
Line 19: Ezēzu, “to be(come) angry, to be in a rage.” Nâḫu, “to rest, to relent.” Agāgu,
“to be(come) furious.” Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled, to be
soothed, to forgive.” Ezēzu and agāgu occur together frequently (see CAD E, 427 for other
examples). The line consists of two grammatically and semantically parallel parts. One
might even suggest a certain phonological similarity between the two as well. As with the
personal gods, the supplicant makes known to Gula their desire for reconciliation with
their angry city god.
ša īziza linūḫa ša īguga lippašra
Line 20: Ṣabātu means “to seize” and abbūtu, “fatherhood, a fatherly attitude.” When
used together the idiom abbūta ṣabātu means “to intercede for someone, to help someone’s
cause” (see CAD Ṣ, 24–25). Despite the masculine connotation of the literal meaning of the
words, the idiom may be applied to gods or, as here, goddesses (see also line 22). Enšu,
“weak, powerless,” is used substantively. A fourth invocation echoes line 1 in the first part
of the line. The second part contains an epithet, which may be interpreting line 1’s
rēmēnītû. In any case, it illustrates Gula’s mercy and concern for the less fortunate.

Line 21: d AMAR . UTU = Marduk (on whom, see page 291). LUGAL = šarru, “king.” EN =
bēlu, “lord,” the masculine form of bēltu, used throughout the prayer. Rēmēnû, “merciful,”
for which see line 1. Marduk is being described with many of the same words used for
Gula earlier in the prayer.
ana Marduk šarri ilī bēlu rēmēnû
Line 22: Qabû, “to speak.” Damiqtu, “favorable, good,” is used substantively (“some-
thing favorable”). See CAD A/1, 50 for a similar line with 3ms pronominal suffixes on the
substantives. In the first half of the line the supplicant appeals to Gula’s merciful nature,
brought out already in line 20 with the same idiom as used here and earlier in lines 1 and
7, where the supplicant invokes caring parental imagery (“merciful mother”). In the sec-
ond half of the line the supplicant appeals to Gula’s effective word for a favorable pro-
nouncement (see lines 15 and 16). In both parts of the line, the supplicant asks Gula to
present the supplicant in a good light before Marduk. The assumption seems to be that
Marduk will have the power to set things right.
abbūtī ṣabtī qibî dameqtī
Line 23: Ṣulūlu, “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor of divine or royal protec-
tion (see CAD Ṣ, 243). Rapšu, “wide.” Tayyartu, “forgiveness” (tajārtu). Kabtu, “heavy,
important, noble, honored.” Bašû, see line 5. The ending –nim is a 1cs dative suffix. This
line brings to the goddess’s attention that her intercession with Marduk on the supplicant’s
behalf would demonstrate her protection and forgiveness for him. In other words, the
requested action in lines 21–22 and the requested relationship in line 23 are two sides of
the same coin.
ṣulūlki rapšu tayyartūki kabtu libšanim-ma
Line 24: Gimillu, “requital, a return in kind, a friendly deed.” Dumqi, “goodness, pros-
perity.” Balāṭu, “life.” UGU = eli, “on, upon, on to.” Šakānu, “to put, to place, to provide.”
The supplicant makes one final, summarizing plea to Gula, which recognizes her actions—
her acceptance of their prayer and successful intercession with Marduk on their behalf—as
the key to future happiness and prosperity.
gimil dumqi u balāṭi elīya šuknī-ma
Line 25: Narbû, “greatness.” Šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to proclaim, to announce.” Dalīlū,
“praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is,
the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomatically, “let me25226. ka-inim-ma šu-íl-lá d [g]u-la-kám

Line 26: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is
directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the
wording of a lifted-hand to Gula.”
Line 27: The ritual is fragmentary. The present text is based on Mayer’s MS G, but is
not in his edition. Other MSS deviate from this one. DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” These
words alert the user of the tablet that the ritual instructions follow. Compare the ÉN at the
beginning of the prayer. IGI = maḫru, “front,” or pānu, “face.” According to Mayer, maḫru
is the more likely reading for ina/ana IGI (see UFBG, 175–76). In any case, the meaning is
the same. KEŠDA = riksu, “ritual arrangement, assemblage of offerings.” Rakāsu, literally,
“to bind, tie up,” but in ritual instructions the word means “to prepare, to set out (offer-
ings).” The other verbs in the ritual instructions should be understood as second person
verbs, too. KAŠ = šikaru, “beer.” SAG = rēšu, “top, head, best.” Šikaru rēšu designates first-
rate beer, a very common item to libate. BAL = naqû, “to pour out, to libate, to sacrifice.”
epuštašu: ana maḫar Gula riksa tarakkas . . . šikara rēša tanaqqi
Line 28: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” Annītu, “this.” 3 -šú = šalāšīšu, “three times.” ŠID =
manû, “to recite, to count.” Teslītu, “petition, request.” Nešmû (N of šemû), “to be heard.”
The final phrase indicates to its user that the ritual-prayer will be successful.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In line 8 we learn that the goddess exists “among the myriad stars of the
heavens” (ina maʾdûti kakkabī šamāmī). The close association of Mesopotamian
gods and stars is well-known among contemporary scholars. 1 For example, Gu-
la’s star is Lyra and her constellation is the one we call Hercules. This close con-
nection between stars and gods is enshrined in the cuneiform writing system: the
divine determinative (DINGIR) looks like a star in the earliest pictographic forms
1
The ancient Hebrew scribes were aware of the Mesopotamian connection, too. See, e.g., Amos
5:26 and the comments on this passage by Shalom Paul, Amos: A Commentary on the Book of
Amos (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991), 194–97. See also my comments below on the “host of
heaven.”𒌋𒐼 A S HUILLA : G ULA 1 A
253
of the script. 2 Given this, it is worth considering whether or not there is a similar
relationship between divinity and stars in the Hebrew Bible. 3
Akkadian kakkabu is etymologically related to the BH word ‫ב‬ ‫כּוֹכ‬,
pl. ‫ים‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ‫כּוֹכ‬.
Like Akkadian, this word usually designates the innumerable group of small
celestial objects that are visibly dimmer than the sun and the moon (see, e.g.,
Gen 37:9, Ecc 12:2). The Hebrew word “host” (‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫—)צ‬a
term closely associated
with the military (both in terms of the army, e.g., Num 2:8, and its activities,
e.g., Num 31:14)—and the phrase “host of heaven” ( ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫צ‬ ְ ) were used as
collective designations for all the stars in the heavens (see, e.g., Isa 45:12, Deut
4:19).
There is some indication in the Hebrew Bible that stars were believed to be
divine beings that could influence the events on earth. Judges 5:20, where stars
fight from heaven against Sisera, is perhaps the best example of such an idea. 4
Stars were therefore venerated as deities both individually as, for example, the
“queen of heaven” (‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ‫כ‬ ֶ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫)מ‬,
identified as Ishtar—our Venus, in Jer 7:18 and
44:17–19, and collectively as the “host of heaven” (‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫א‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫)צ‬
in, for example, 2
Kgs 17:16, 21:3, 5, Jer 19:13, and Zeph 1:5. Some scholars have suggested this
astral worship was a direct result of Assyrian and then Babylonian influence. 5 In
any case, all such worship was illicit and condemned repeatedly by biblical au-
thors (see the previous references and, e.g., Deut 17:2–5, 2 Kgs 23:4–5, Job
31:26). In fact, Deut 4:19 informs the Israelites that Yahweh gave the worship of
celestial bodies to other nations, not to Israel.
Although the Hebrew deity’s dwelling was in the heavenlies (Ps 103:19), as
high as the stars (Job 22:12, Isa 14:13), it is significant that Yahweh himself is
never described as a star in the Hebrew Bible. Rather, Yahweh is always consid-
ered superior to anything in the celestial sphere. The stars and the heavenly
host, for example, are often said to be created or counted or in some way con-
trolled by Yawheh (e.g., Gen 1:16, 2:1, Ps 8:4, 136:9, 147:4, Jer 31:35, Job 9:7
[see v. 9], Ezek 32:7, Isa 13:10, 40:26, Joel 2:10, 15 [and see Amos 5:8 and Job
38:31–32, which name particular stars]). In Ps 148:2–4 celestial bodies offer
praise to Yahweh; in Neh 9:6 the host of heaven bow down to him, their creator;
and in Job 25:5 the stars are said to be impure compared to the Hebrew god.
Yet Yahweh’s royal retinue, his servants that surround him in the divine as-
sembly, is sometimes identified as the heavenly host (1 Kgs 22:19, 2 Chron

Another important context for seeing the connection between stars and divinity is Isa 14:12–
15, where a divinized king’s hubris is punished by Yahweh with expulsion from among the stars.
See Mattias Albani, “The Downfall of Helel, the Son of Dawn: Aspects of Royal Ideology in Isa
14:12–13,” in The Fall of the Angels (ed. Christoph Auffarth and Loren T. Stuckenbruck; Themes
in Biblical Narrative; Leiden: Brill, 2004), 62–86.

See, e.g., Lelli, “Stars,” 811.25418:18; and note Ps 103:20–21 and 148:2, where ‫יו‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫צ‬,
“his hosts,” and ‫יו‬ ‫כ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ָ ְ‫ל‬ ‫מ‬,
“his messengers,” are in parallel) or stars (see Job 38:7, where ‫ר‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֶ ‫ב‬ ‫י‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ‫כּוֹכ‬,
“morn-
ing stars,” and ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫י‬ ֵ‫נ‬ ‫ל־בּ‬
‫כּ‬,
“all the sons of god,” are in parallel). Yahweh stands
over these lesser divine beings (who are apparently not gods) as their king (Ps
103:19–21).
Yahweh himself was therefore not closely associated with a particular star
as was Gula; rather, he was the creator (Isa 40:26, Neh 9:6) and ruler of the ce-
lestial host (see Ps 89:6–9).

A Shuilla: Ishtar 2
“The Great Ishtar Prayer”
A NNA E LISE Z ERNECKE
I SHTAR :
See page 169.
T HE P RAYER :
The prayer Ishtar 2 is unique in its form, length, and transmission. Only one
of its six textual witnesses known in Akkadian preserves a subscription that clas-
sifies the prayer as a “prayer of the lifting of the hand” (šu-íl-lá). The present
treatment of the prayer follows this tablet exclusively, the only copy in which no
text is missing ( MS A in Zgoll’s edition). Its provenance is unknown. The tablet is
in the British Museum today (BM 26187). The colophon describes it as a votive
offering in the temple Esagila in Babylon, being the copy of an original from
Borsippa. Two copies of the prayer were found in Boğazköy, one of them in Ak-
kadian ( MS F in Zgoll), and a very fragmentary second one in Hittite. 1 Together
with a tablet from the Emar region containing Ishtar 10, 2 these tablets are the
only attestations of prayers from the second millennium that are later known as
shuillas, though neither this classification nor any other subscription is pre-
served in these early copies. 3 Despite the fragmentary state of the Akkadian text
from Boğazköy, it can be demonstrated that it contained a shorter version of the
prayer in which the praise of the deity was proportionally much more im-
portant. 4
The structure of the prayer can be established by correlating aspects of form
(the various uses of first, second, and third person voice, preponderance of nom-
inal clauses and/or predicative constructions versus imperatives and precatives)

257258and content. The beginning and the end of the prayer are formed by (hymnic)
invocations of the deity (lines 1–41, 103–105), the middle section is character-
ized by two petitions (lines 42–55, 79–102) framing a complaint (lines 56–78). 5
The first invocation (lines 1–41) contains epithets and sentences praising
Ishtar’s astral radiance, her power and prowess, and her cosmic and cultic im-
portance. This long section of praise culminates in the mentioning of Ishtar’s
function as righteous and pardoning judge (lines 25–26) and her attention to the
weak and sick (lines 40–41). Ishtar is the subject of inflected verbs only in these
two passages of the opening invocation. Throughout the invocation, the suppli-
cant approaches Ishtar in various ways: the address changes several times be-
tween third person and the more intimate second person voice.
The beginning of the first petition (lines 42–55) corresponds to the begin-
ning of the prayer: the supplicant mentions an act of invocation (line 42, com-
pare line 1) and characterizes themselves as weak and in pain, just after having
praised Ishtar’s saving of the weak and sick in general (lines 40–41). The main
aim of the first petition is to gain Ishtar’s attention and to pray for her for-
giveness (lines 45–50), as her wrath seems to be the most important reason for
their suffering (lines 45, 51–52).
The complaint (lines 56–78) describes the suffering of the supplicant and
the hostility of enemies and others. The state of the supplicant is compared to
natural phenomena (lines 62–64). The supplicant does not find fault in their
behavior, but feels to be treated as if they had neglected the personal protecting
deities (lines 67–68). The supplicant is separated from deities and humankind
and is already in the sphere of death (line 74). They are not active: in most cases
in which they are the subject, the verb is either intransitive or the form is a pre-
dicative construction.
The second petition (lines 79–102) is dominated by precise requests for Ish-
tar’s action and her care for the supplicant. They hope for an end of the disturb-
ance in their relations to both gods and humans. Only here do they mention
their guilt, but the terminology is comprehensive (lines 80–82). The supplicant
hopes for Ishtar’s intervention against enemies (lines 97–98) so that they them-
selves will be judged as a living demonstration of her might (lines 101–102).
The final section of invocation and praise (lines 103–105) forms the antici-
pated praise of the supplicant and the witnesses of Ishtar’s saving actions on the
supplicant’s behalf (compare lines 101–102). Most of the vocabulary is derived
from the beginning of the prayer (lines 1–5). Thus, the final praise forms an in-
clusio with the very beginning of the prayer. The ritual instruction demands the

The structure can also be analysed differently; compare Wright, 116; Reiner and Güterbock,
263; Mayer, UFBG, 28–29, n.60; Zgoll, 69. The differences are caused by transitional passages
leading from one main part to the next and by differing analyses of the overall structure of the
prayer (see Zernecke, 99–100). Mayer, UFBG, 28–29, n.60 characterizes Ishtar 2 as an atypical
shuilla because of its length, its elaborated structure, the repetitions of certain words and phrases
(“litaneiartig”) and the exceptional and partly literary motifs.𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

prayer to be recited three times (lines 109–110). Thereby, beginning and end
would merge. 6
Ishtar 2 is a very complex prayer with an elaborate structure. Only a few
aspects of the complex framework of references interlacing all parts can be men-
tioned here. The first lines of every part establish the mode of speech and the
main topic of the following lines. Furthermore, several “seams” are highlighted
by the use of terms for speech and prayer (lines 1, 42, 79–80). Also, the seman-
tic field of sight, face, care, and aversion pervades the prayer in different and
characteristic nuances. The relationship between Ishtar and the supplicant
changes in the course of the prayer. This can be shown best in the way the god-
dess is addressed: in both invocations, a variety of names is used (Ishtar, Irnini,
and Gushea) and—among others—the title bēlet, “lady.” In both petitions and in
the complaint, she is almost exclusively addressed as bēltī, “my lady,” thus ac-
centuating the personal relation between the supplicant and the goddess. 7 The
overall structure of the prayer can be described as approaching Ishtar for the
request that is reinforced by the complaint, and then withdrawing out of the
presence of the goddess. The ritual demanding the repeated recitation emphasiz-
es this circular structure. 8
No normalization of this text has been published so far. This is possibly not
without reason, as the written vowels frequently do not correspond to the stand-
ard grammar, especially at the end of the words. So every attempt to transcribe
the text “normalizes” it “away” from the textual witness. The normalization giv-
en here tries to follow the text.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, the superscription of the prayer, corresponding to the subscription
in line 106. Both superscription and subscription are not part of the prayer itself, but form
a frame for the text to be recited. Šiptu, derived from the same root as āšipu, the designa-
tion for the ritual specialist, is usually translated as “incantation” (CAD Š/3, 86). This
translation suggests a classification of the following text as “magical.” As the opposition of
“magic” and “religion” is obsolete, šiptu should be understood as a technical term for the
beginning of the text to be recited in a ritual. Compare Mayer, UFBG, 22–23 and Zernecke,
326. Sullû, a D preterite with suffix, “to implore, to pray to,” can be interpreted as per-
formative (Koinzidenzfall), Mayer, UFBG, 181–209. The same form occurs again in line 80
at the beginning of the second petition. Bēltu, “lady.” Iltu, “goddess.”
šiptu: usallīki bēlet bēlēti ilat ilāti
Line 2: Šarratu, “queen.” Šarrat is the expected bound form; the vowel at the end in
our text is unnecessary, which is not atypical in late Babylonian copies. Kullatu, “whole.”
Dadmū, “inhabited world.” Šarrati kullat dadmē is a construct chain. Šutēšuru (Št lex. of
ešēru), “to guide aright.” Tenēštu, “people, personnel,” pl. tenēšētu, “humankind.” The par-
ticiple, muštēširat, is used here to characterize Ishtar’s action towards humankind. In line
26 the objects of her guidance are the wronged and afflicted (compare ešēru in the G stem
in line 41), whereas in line 84 (imperative Št lex.) the supplicant uses it to ask her for
guidance.
Ištar šarrati kullat dadmē muštēširat tenēšēti
Line 3: d Irnini is an alternative name of Ishtar. Muttallu (muttellu), “noble.” The form,
muttallāti, is a 2fs predicative. This is the first time the goddess is addressed in the second
person. Rabû (m), rabītu (f), “big, great.” Ra-bat is problematic. As rabāt, the word may be
an unexpected fem. sg. form of the adj. bound to the following gen. (see CAD R, 37 and
the analogous leʾāt in line 32). Rabīt Igigî, “greatest of the Igigi,” is one of Ishtar’s epithets
(see page 112 for an example in an OB hymn). Alternatively, perhaps ra-bat is the 3fs pre-
dicative, rabât, “she is great,” but the change of person in the middle of the line seems
odd. Igigû is a general name for the gods of heaven, in contrast to Anunnakkū, who are the
gods of the netherworld (see Black and Green, 106; in Enūma eliš VI 69 the Igigû number
three hundred and the Anunnakkū six hundred whereas in VI 39–44, contradictorily, the
two groups both number three hundred).

Line 4: The predicatives continue in this line. Gašru, “powerful, very strong.” Malkatu,
“ruler (f), queen.” Šumu, “name.” Ṣīru, “exalted.” Ishtar’s name(s) are also praised in lines
15, 20, 22.
gašrāti malkāti šumūki ṣīrū
Line 5: Attī, “you” (fs). Nannartu, “luminary, light of the sky.” AN = šamû, “heaven”;
also in lines 20, 27, and 35. Interestingly, in lines 13 and 63, “heaven” is written syllabi-
cally as šá-ma-mi (gen. of šamāmū). But in both lines, this is not in the formula “heaven
and earth.” KI . TIM = erṣetu, “earth,” also in lines 13, 20, 27, 35. Zgoll, 61 classifies this
writing as pseudologographic or archaizing. Mārtu, “daughter.” d 30 = Sîn, the moon god
(see page 385). Qardu (m), qarittu (f), “heroic, valiant.” We expect qaritti here to be in the
nominative (qarittu), as in Zgoll’s MS C. The epithet mārat Sîn qaritti reappears as the last
words of the prayer in line 105.
attī-ma nannarat šamê u erṣeti mārat Sîn qaritti
Line 6: Ittabbulu (Gtn of [w]abālu), “to look after, to maintain, to serve; to control, to
steer.” Muttabbilat is the Gtn participle. GIŠ . TUKUL = kakku, “weapon.” Šakānu, “to put, to
place, to arrange.” Tuquntu (tuqumtu), “battle.”
muttabbilat kakkī šākinat tuqunti
Line 7: Ḫamāmu, “to gather, to collect.” Gimru, “totality, all.” Apāru, “to cover the
head, to wear on the head.” Agû, “crown.” Bēlūtu, “lordship.” Because of the varied mean-
ings of parṣu (also, line 15), “rite, ritual; temple office; divine authority, power, office;
symbol, insignia; authoritative decision, command, decree; custom, practice” (see CAD P,
195), the translations of this line differ widely. See Zgoll, 61.
ḫāmimat gimir parṣī āpirat agê bēlūti
Line 8: GAŠAN = bēltu, here a vocative; compare lines 29 and 104. Interestingly, this
title in this form is used only in the invocations. In the petitions and the complaint, bēltu is
always written with a first person pronominal suffix ( d GAŠAN . MU = bēltī, lines 43, 56, 59,

cases (genitive constructions), be-let is found (lines 1, 11, 27, 28, 30). Šūpû, “resplendent,
manifest.” Narbû, “greatness” (s), “great feats” (pl). UGU = eli, “on, over, above.” Kalû
(absolute, kala), “all.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.”

Line 9: MUL = kakkabu, “star.” Tanūqātu, “battle cry.” Šutamḫuṣu (Št lex. of maḫāṣu),
“to cause constant enmity” (see CAD M/1, 84). ŠEŠ = aḫu, “brother.” Mitguru, “harmoni-
ous.”

Line 10: Itaddunu (Gtn of nadānu), “to give constantly, repeatedly.” Itbāru, “friend,
colleague.” Compared to the rest of the text, this line is half as long as a normal line. But
on the tablet BM 26187, it is written as a whole line. Compare line 92, where the second
part of the line is erased.

Line 11: Itburtu is a hapax legomenon. AHw, 263 (etpuru) derives it from apāru and
translates “mit Tiara geschmückt” (“adorned with a Tiara”), compare CDA, 136 (itpuru).
Zgoll, 62 explains the form as a Gt verbal adjective of abāru / ubburu, characterizing Ish-
tar’s strength; see CAD I/J, 295. The same meaning is assumed in the translations of Foster
(“Strong (?) one,” 601) and Stephens (“O mighty one,” 384). Tūšaru (tūšāru), “battlefield,
pitched battle.” Muttakkipu, “goring, knocking over” (based on the Gtn participle of
nakāpu). Zgoll, 62 identifies šá-di-ia as a late Babylonian writing for šadî, “mountains”
(gen.).
itburti bēlet tūšari muttakkipat šadî
Line 12: Gušea is an alternative name for Ishtar, related to the poem of Agushaya and
Ishtar’s function as goddess of war (see Zgoll, 62). Ḫalāpu, “to slip into,” but in the predic-
ative (as here, 3fs), “clad in.” Labāšu, “to clothe oneself”; predicative, “clothed with.”
Ḫurbāšu, “terror, frost.”
Gušea ša tuqunta ḫalpat labišat ḫurbāša
Line 13: Gamāru, “to bring to conclusion, to settle.” Šipṭu, “judgment, verdict,” is
mentioned again in line 73 as something the supplicant has witnessed and is a source of
his complaints. EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision.” Ûrtu ([w]uʾʾurtu), “command, commission.”
KI . TIM = erṣetu, compare line 5, also concerning the syllabical writing of šamāmū, “heav-
en,” which can be found twice in this text, always at the end of the line (lines 13, 63).

probably to be analyzed as nom. plural. Kâši, “to you.” The verb puqqu, “to pay attention
to,” can be found again in line 79 at the very beginning of the second petition. In both
cases, Ishtar is the object. In line 79, the supplicant is the subject.

Line 15: Ēkīam, “where?” MU = šumu, “name,” see also line 22. Parṣu, see line 7.
Lines 15–17 all begin with ēkīam lā. This is not the only chain of lines beginning with the
same word or groups of words; in fact, it is one of the typical features of this prayer (see
lines 27–30, 46–50, 72–73, and 93–94). Note that only the repetitions in the first invoca-
tion have parallels in the version from Boğazköy (lines 15–16, 27–30).

Line 16: GIŠ . ḪUR = uṣurtu, “drawing, plan,” in the plural, “ordinances” of the gods.
Note the figura etymologica with uṣṣuru (D of eṣēru), “to draw, to plan.” ŠUB = nadû, “to
throw, to lay down,” also of foundations. The translation “set up” follows Foster, 602. BÁRA
= parakku, see line 14.
ēkīam lā uṣṣurā uṣurātīki ēkīam lā nadû parakkūki
Line 17: The adjectives rabû and ṣīru, in 2fs predicative form here, are used several
times in correspondence to characterize Ishtar. Rabû can be found in lines 3, 17, 23, and in
line 100 in an intensified form (rabbû); see also rabû, the verb with the same root, in lines
18 (Š) and 34 (G). Ṣīru is equally used several times for Ishtar: lines 4, 17, 23, 103, and
104. Line 17 therefore structures the text by relating to the combination of both adjectives
in lines 3 and 4 and to line 23. Lines 17 and 23 are especially parallel; they form a frame
around the passage dealing with Ishtar’s exaltation (lines 18–22).
ēkīam lā rabâti ēkīam lā ṣīrāti
Line 18: Anum, the god of heaven, see page 217. Ellil, the god of wind. Ea, the god of
water, wisdom, and magic, see page 227. These three gods are the highest gods in the
Mesopotamian pantheon. Ullû (D of elû), “to raise, to elevate.” Ina, “in, among, at.” The
line consists of two clauses. Ina ilī stands between both and can be understood as part of
either. Šurbû (Š of rabû), “to make great, to aggrandize, to promote, to magnify.” Lines 18–
19 (in fact, through line 22) refer to Ishtar’s exaltation among the gods, which is also
known from a separate text: Blahoslav Hruška, “Das spätbabylonische Lehrgedicht ‘Inannas
Erhöhung,’” ArOr 37 (1969), 473–522. In this text, Ishtar is made the queen of heaven and
earth and receives supreme power. In the present context (lines 18–22) the structure of the
text changes: verbal clauses dominate.

Line 19: Šašqû (Š of šaqû), “to exalt, to elevate.” Napḫaru, “total, sum, entirety.” As
with ina ilī in line 18, ina napḫar Igigî can be understood as pertaining to both clauses in
the line. Šūturu (Š of [w]atāru), “to make surpass, to make excel.” Manzāzu (mazzāzu),
“position, rank, abode.”

Line 20: Ḫissatu sometimes means “understanding, wisdom,” but here connotes “men-
tion, thought.” Râbu, “to shake, to tremble.”

Line 24: Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” refers to humankind. The imagery
comes from the simile of people as sheep in need of leadership. Nammaššû (nammaštû),
“moving things, animals, herds; settlement, people.” Qurdu (s), “heroism,” (pl), “heroic
acts.” Dalālu, “to praise, to glorify,” is interpreted in the translations as having two or
three subjects, with nam-maš-šu-ú te-né-še-e-ti as either a construct chain or as two nomina-
tives. The vowel ending of nam-maš-šu-ú makes the interpretation as construct chain more
probable. An interpretation as two nominatives cannot explain the ending vowel of te-né-
še-e-ti. The translation given here follows Zgoll, 50, in analyzing the two words as a con-
struct chain.

Line 25: Dīnu, “legal decision, lawsuit.” Baḫūlātu (baʾūlātu), “subjects, people,
troops.” Kittu, “truth.” Mīšaru, “justice.” Dânu (diānum), “to judge.” Lines 25 and 26 are
very important for the characterization of Ishtar in the first invocation: only here and in
line 40 is she the subject of inflected verbs, all of which are in the present (durative) in its𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

habitual function. Ishtar’s actions are described; her astral dimensions, cosmic importance,
or prowess in war are set aside: she is a righteous judge. Interestingly, lines 25–26 have no
parallel in the version from Boğazköy.
dīn baḫūlāti ina kitti u mīšari tadinnī attī
Line 26: This line is central for the connection between the first invocation and the
rest of the text. The verb Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to look at, to look favorably upon,” is
used for the first time to characterize Ishtar’s action as regards suffering. In line 40, she is
again subject of this verb. In the later parts of the prayer, the petition kīniš naplisīnnī-[ma],
“look faithfully upon me,” is repeated three times (lines 44, 54, 92); it is the most frequent
petition and is clearly related to the description of Ishtar’s actions in lines 26 and 40. The
second verb, šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to guide aright,” connects line 26 to the very be-
ginning of the prayer (line 2) and is also used at the end of the invocation (line 41) and in
a petition (line 84, see the note to line 2). Ishtar is helpful towards the ḫablu, the “wronged
person,” and the šagšu (verbal adj. of šagāšu “to kill, to slaughter”), here translated as “af-
flicted”—apparently a person in a life-threatening situation. Uddakam, “every day, forev-
er.”
tapallasī ḫablu u šagšu tušteššerī uddakam
Line 27: Lines 27–30 begin with aḫulap, “an exclamation used to express or to seek
compassion”; the word denotes both the mercy granted by a god or king or the petition for
such mercy (CAD A/1, 213–14; AHw, 22–23. See Zgoll, 75, n.164). Here aḫulap (with a 2fs
suffix and always followed by an address to Ishtar) is Ishtar’s answer to prayers, which is
praised by the supplicant. See the corresponding lines 45–50, which also begin with aḫulap
but this time with a 1cs suffix or as regens in a construct chain with this suffix. There, in
the first petition, the supplicant prays for Ishtar’s verbal action that they praise in lines 27–
30. Rēʾâtu (rēʾītu), “shepherd” (f). UN . MEŠ = nišū, “people.” Apâtu, “numerous, teeming.”
aḫulapki bēlet šamê u erṣeti rēʾât nišī apâti
Line 28: E-ana (E-anna) is the name of Ishtar’s temple in Uruk. Quddušu, “holy, con-
secrated.” Šutummu, “storehouse, treasury.” Ellu, “pure, clean, holy.” We expect the gen.
case ending on the last three words.
aḫulapki bēlet Eanna quddušu šutummu ellu
Line 29: See the notes to line 8. GÌR = šēpu, “foot”; II = the dual sign. Anīḫu (āniḫu),
“tired.” Lāsimu, “swift.” Both adjs. are used predicatively (3fp). Birku, “knee.” Like šēpu,
birku is a dual.

Line 30: Tāḫāzī (gen. pl.), “battles, combats.” bēlet tāḫāzī is a construct chain.
Tamḫārī (gen. pl.), “battles, combats”, is a second nomen rectum. Kalîšunu, “all of them,”
breaks the chain and is probably related to both recta.
aḫulapki bēlet tāḫāzī kalîšunu tamḫārī
Line 31: The MEŠ sign is actually a ME on the tablet; the exclamation point marks
the correction. Šūpūtu is the fem. sg. form of šūpû, for which see line 8. Labbatu (lābatu),
“lioness.” Kunnušu (D of kanāšu), “to subject, to force submission.” Sabsu (šabsu), “angry.”
Mukannišat ilī sabsūti is an important epithet for the course of the prayer because it corre-
sponds to several petitions: compare the use of sabsu in line 86 and the combination of
sabsu and kanāšu (D stem) in line 98 (Zgoll, 94; Zernecke, 149). In lines 31–33, Ishtar’s
rule over all humankind is detailed depending on their social rank.
šūpūtu labbat Igigî mukannišat ilī sabsūti
Line 32: Lēʾû (m), lēʾītu (f; also lēʾātu, see CAD L, 160), “powerful, capable.” Malku,
“prince.” We expect the oblique plural to be malkī. Ṣabātu, “to hold, to seize.” Ṣerretu,
“nose-rope,” was a rope tied to a ring that pierced the nose of an animal in order to con-
trol it. The same method was used on captive humans (see CAD Ṣ, 136–37 for a brief dis-
cussion). LUGAL = šarru, “king.”
lēʾāt kalîšunu malkū ṣābitat ṣerret šarrī
Line 33: Petû, “to open.” Pētât is a fs participle, bound form. Pusummu, “veil.” KI . SIKIL
= (w)ardatu, “girl, young woman.” This (and possibly line 39) is the only reference to
Ishtar’s otherwise prominent function as erotic goddess.
pētât pusummē ša kalîšina ardāti
Line 34: Nanšû (N of našû), “to be raised.” Nandû (N of nadû), “to be laid down.” The
first two words of the line can be understood as 3fs predicatives, uncontracted nanšeat for
expected nanšât and uncontracted nandiat for nandât (see GAG §102c). The content is diffi-
cult to understand. Since a reference to defeat is hardly probable in such a hymnic context,
an astral interpretation, relating to the different positions of the planet Venus, seems to be
most plausible (Zgoll, 50, n.130; Zernecke, 80, n.36). The CAD offers two other alterna-
tives. On the one hand, CAD N/2, 111 cautiously interprets the words as 2fs predicative
forms of našû and nadû and translates them with a military interpretation: “whether you
have been elevated or brought down, heroic Ištar (your warlike deeds are great).” CAD E,
379, 413, on the other hand, takes the words as forms of ešû and eṭû and translates, “(Ish-
tar) is disturbed, gloomy.”

Line 36: Ezzu (m), ezzetu (f), “furious,” is used substantively here. Qablu, “battle.” Lā
maḫār, “not confrontable, not opposeable; irresistible.” Qablu lā maḫār can be understood
as a frozen construction that was used as an adjective (see Burkhart Kienast, “qabal lā
maḫār,” JCS 29 [1977], 73–77). Alīlu (m), alīltu (f), “powerful,” is also used substantively.

Line 38: Mummiltu is often used for Ishtar, but it is not clear from which root it is de-
rived. Two possibilities are discussed: mummillu, derived from mēlulu (“dancer, player,
actor”), would lead to a translation as “dancing Ishtar” (see CAD M/2 196 and Foster,
603). The alternative is a D participle of (w)amālu, “to veil, to darken, to eclipse,” but also
used in connection with scintillating stars (AHw, 1459). In this latter case the word can be
understood as being related to Ishtar’s astral aspect (“scintillating, glimmering”), see Zgoll,
51; Zernecke, 81, n.38. Puḫḫuru (D of paḫāru), “to bring together, to assemble.” Puḫru,
“assembly.”
mummiltu Ištar mupaḫḫirat puḫri
Line 39: NITA = zikaru, “male, man.” MUNUS = sinništu, “female, woman.” d Ištar is in
this case probably not the name of the goddess but the bound form of the noun ištaru,
“goddess.” Note the unequivocal instances of ištaru, “goddess,” in lines 67, 68, 86 (always
with ilu), which are also written with the determinative. Lamādu, “to learn.” Milku, “ad-
vice, counsel, plan.” Mamman, “somebody,” with neg. “nobody.”
ilat zikarī ištar / Ištar sinnišāti ša lā ilammadu milikšu mamman
Line 40: Ašru, “place.” The bound form, ašar, indicates that a subordinate clause fol-
lows (comprising one verb); the word may be translated as “wherever.” Balāṭu, “to live, to
be healed.” ADDA (LÚ X ÚŠ) = mītu, “dead, dead person.” Tebû, “to rise up, to get up.”
Marṣu, “sick, sick person.” As in lines 25–26, Ishtar here is the subject of an inflected verb,
the N stem of palāsu, as in line 25 (see the notes to lines 25–26). The designation of the26841. iš-ši-ir la i-šá-ru a-mi-ru pa-ni-ki

person who receives help as marṣu is interesting, as the supplicant uses šumruṣu, derived
from the same root and intensified in meaning, as a self-description only two lines later
(line 42; see also lines 47 and 66). In the complaint, they describe themselves as being
already in the sphere of death (line 74).
ašar tappallasī iballuṭ mītu itebbi marṣu
Line 41: Ešēru, “to be well, to thrive, to prosper.” Lā išaru is a substantive here, mean-
ing “the one who is not right.” Amāru, “to see, to look at.” The form of āmiru is a ms parti-
ciple, bound to pānū, “face.” An “overhanging” u on a participle in construct is not un-
common in SB Akkadian (see Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der
jungbabylonischen „hymnischen“ Literatur, 2 Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien
14/1–2; Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 2.41 for numerous examples). In lines 40–
41, at the end of the first invocation, Ishtar’s help for the afflicted is presented as eye con-
tact. The goddess’ gaze gives life (line 40); a look at the goddess puts one in order (line
41). The motif of eye contact between Ishtar and the supplicant is central throughout the
whole prayer.
iššir lā išaru āmiru pānīki
Line 42: Anāku, “I.” Šasû, “to call out.” Alsīki is a 1cs preterite and is to be interpret-
ed as performative (see line 1). Anḫu, “tired.” Šūnuḫu, “wearied.” Both adjs. come from
anāḫu. Šumruṣu, “suffering” (adj.). ÌR = (w)ardu, “slave, servant.” Referring back to line 1,
the supplicant mentions their act of praying at the beginning of the first petition (lines 42–
55; see the introduction to the prayer). There is no self-introduction in Ishtar 2, where the
supplicant has to mention their or their father’s name (see Mayer, UFBG, 46–58). Instead,
they introduce themselves in line 42 with their relation to Ishtar as her servant (aradki)
and as an afflicted person, therefore already identifying themselves as the afflicted who
receives the help of the goddess (lines 25–26, 40–41).

Line 43: A . MUR -in-ni-ma: Zgoll interprets this as an alternative (CVC for CC) writing
for amrīnnī-ma, which is a G fs impv. with a 1cs suffix and enclitic –ma. This is not unique
in the shuilla-prayers addressed to Ishtar (see Zgoll, 64, 189). d GAŠAN . MU = bēltī, see note
to line 8. Leqû, “to receive, to accept.” Unnīnu, “supplication, petition.” In correspondence
to the end of the invocation, the very first petition resumes the subject of eye contact: the
supplicant asks the goddess to look at them. The second petition mentions the actual pray-
er. It is a typical stock-phrase, repeated in line 82 (see Mayer, UFBG, 217).

Line 44: Kīniš, “faithfully, truly.” Both petitions are typical (see Mayer, UFBG, 214,

N stem, here as an impv.; see the note to line 26) and the praying (teslītu, “prayer,” which𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

comes from the same root as sullû in lines 1 and 80). The petition kīniš naplisīnnī-[ma] is
repeated three times in this single prayer (lines 44, 54, 92). Šemû, “to hear.”
kīniš naplisīnnī-ma šimê teslītī
Line 45: See line 27. Both parts of the line are usual stock-phrases in petitions. Kabat-
taki lippašra appears also in lines 52, 96. See Mayer, UFBG, 226, 241. Kabattu, often in
parallel to libbu, “heart” (see lines 51–52), probably denotes the liver, but more often
“emotions, thoughts, mind, spirit” (CAD K, 11). This reflects the physiological observation
that the intestines react very strongly to negative situations (compare the use of “guts” in
English!). Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled, to forgive.” Lippašra is a
3cs precative with a 1cs dative suffix (–a).
aḫulapīya qibî-ma kabattaki lippašra
Line 46: SU = zumru, “body, person.” Nassu, “groaning, wretched.” Malû, “to be full.”
Although it looks like the infinitive, malû is a 3ms predicative with the subjunctive –u,
which has contracted with the i of mali. Ešû, “confused.” Dalḫu, “troubled, disturbed.”
Lines 46–50 are part of the first petition, but already they give information about the suf-
fering of the supplicant. It is interesting that most of the vocabulary is not reused in the
complaint (see Zernecke, 136).
aḫulap zumrīya nassi ša malû ešâti u dalḫāti
Line 47: Šumruṣu modifies libbīya despite the presence of a nom. case ending. Dimtu,
“tear,” is translated as plural, but it is singular; see also in line 50. Tānēḫu, “sighing, dis-
tress.”
aḫulap libbīya šumruṣu ša malû dimti u tānēḫi
Line 48: Note that the omina (têrtu, “omen,” pl. têrētu) are qualified in the same way
as the body in line 46 (nassu, ešû, and dalḫu).
aḫulap têrētīya nassāti ešâti u dalḫāti
Line 49: É = bītu, “house.” Šudlupu, “sleepless, troubled.” Nussusu (D of nasāsu), “to
lament, to wail, to moan.” ÉR = bikītu, “weeping, wailing, mourning.”
aḫulap bītīya šudlupu ša unassasu bikâti
Line 50: See note on line 47. Šutabrû (Št lex. of bitrû), “to continue, to persevere.”
Uštabarrû is a durative with subjunctive –u (see AHw, 123, sub berû/barû II and CAD B,
280, sub bitrû). Kabtatu (lines 50, 94) is an alternative form of kabattu (see line 45). The27051. d ir-ni-ni(one sign erased)-i-tu 4 la-ab-bu na-ad-ru lìb-ba-ki li-nu-ḫa

description of the suffering of the supplicant’s kabattu (lines 50, 66) corresponds to the
petitions concerning Ishtar’s kabattu (lines 45, 52, 94, 96).
aḫulap kabtatīya ša uštabarrû dimti u tānēḫi
Line 51: The interpretation of Irninītu (hapax legomenon) is dubious because of the
erasure. As the text is very diligently written and corrected (see lines 32, 82, and 92), it is
most probably to be considered as a form of Ishtar’s name Irnini (see lines 3 and 105).
Possibly, it is a mythical allusion (see Zgoll, 279). Labbu, “lion.” Nadru, “wild, aggressive.”
Nâḫu, “to (be at) rest, to calm down.” Linūḫa is a 3cs precative with a 1cs dative suffix.
This and the following line contain the first references to the supplicant as the object of
Ishtar’s wrath.
Irninītu labbu nadru libbaki linūḫa
Line 52: Rīmu, “wild bull.” Šabbasû, “very angry.” See also the notes to line 45.
rīmu šabbasû kabattaki lippašra
Line 53: SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f; see line 95), “good, kind.” IGI = īnu, “eye”;
with the dual sign. Bašû, “to be.” Eli, “on, over, upon.” This line and the following two,
which conclude the first petition, contain yet another reference to the eye contact between
supplicant and deity.
damqātu īnāki libšâ elīya
Line 54: Būnu, “goodness, outward appearance,” pl. “face.” Namru (nawrum), “bright,
shining.” See also the note to line 44.
ina būnīki namrūti kīniš naplisīnni yâši
Line 55: Ukkušu (D of akāšu), “to drive away, to expel.” upīšū, “magical procedures,”
is typically plural. We therefore expect upīšī here as the object of the impv. ḪUL = lemnu,
“bad, evil.” SU = zumru, see line 46. ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.” Lūmur is a 1cs precative from
amāru.
ukkišī upīša lemnūti ša zumrīya nūrki namru lūmur
Line 56: Adi mati, “how long?” The complaint (lines 56–78) is introduced by two
questions (lines 56 and 59); in the second petition, another two questions have the same
interrogative particle (lines 93–94). The seam of the text before line 56 is not stressed by
references to the act of praying (see lines 1, 42, and 79–80), but the theme of eye contact
is kept up, though it is now the malevolent regard of the enemies (nekelmû, “to frown at,𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

to regard malevolently”; the form is an “active-stative” or transitive parsāku construction).
EN = bēlu, “lord, master.” Bēl dabābi, “adversary, enemy.”
adi mati bēltī bēlū dabābīya nekelmûʾinnī-ma
Line 57: Surru, “deceit, falsehood.” Kīnu, “true, right.” Kapādu, “to plan, to scheme
against.” Lemnu, “bad, evil.”
ina surrāti u lā kīnāti ikappudūni lemnēti
Line 58: Rēdû, “pursuer, persecutor.” Ḫādû, “one who rejoices, gloats,” is a person
who takes pleasure in another’s misfortune. UGU = eli. We find ištammarū here instead of
ištammurū, 3mp durative. The verb is the Gt of šamāru, “to be furious, to attack furiously,
to rage”; see Zgoll, 64.
rēdûya ḫādûya ištammarū elīya
Line 59: Lillu, “idiot.” Akû can mean “cripple” or “powerless, weak,” depending on
which of the two homonyms one accepts in the context. Bâʾu, “to walk, to go along, to
pass, to overtake, to defeat.”
adi mati bēltī lillu akû ibâʾanni
Line 60: Panû, “to go ahead, to be in front.” Muqqu, “wearied.” Arkû (warkû), “rear,
hindmost.” Nemerkû (namarkû; N stem), “to be late, to lag behind.” Ammerki is a 1cs pret-
erite.
ipnânni muqqu arkûm-ma anāku ammerki
Line 61: Enšu, “weak.” Danānu, “to be(come) strong.” Enēšu, “to be(come) weak.”
enšūti idninū-ma anāku ēniš
Line 62: Sabāʾu, “to rock, to toss about.” Agû, “wave” (compare the homonym in line
7). Uppuqu (D of epēqu), “to make massive” (see CAD E, 184). IM = šāru, “wind, breath.”
asabbuʾ kīma agî ša uppaqu šāru lemna
Line 63: Šâʾu, “to fly.” Itaprušu (Ntn of naprušu), “to fly about.” Ittanapraš is a 3cs du-
rative. Iṣṣūru, “bird.”

Line 64: Damāmu, “to wail, to moan.” Summatu, “dove, pigeon.” Mūšu, “night.” Urru,
“day.” The simile is a stock-phrase used in several prayers, see Mayer, UFBG, 83.
adammum kīma summatu mūši u urra
Line 65: The meaning of nangulāku (N 1cs predicative from nagālu) is uncertain; the
verb is used in two different contexts: with stars as subject or with expressions of emo-
tions, especially in complaints. Zgoll, 52, 65 translates as “glühend” (“glowing / burning”),
because of a possible reference to a symptom of an illness. See Zernecke, 83. n.45. Bakû,
“to weep, to cry.” Ṣarpiš, “bitterly.”
nangulākū-ma abakki ṣarpiš
Line 66: Ūʾa, “woe! alas!” Â (ai), “alas!” See also line 42.
ina ūʾa â šumruṣat kabattī
Line 67: Mīnâ (mīnu), “what?” Epēšu, “to do, to make.” In this line, the “third party
involved” is introduced, the supplicant’s personal protective deities. Ištaru with suffix is
here definitely not the principal addressee of the prayer but used as a noun for “goddess.”
Like Ishtar (see lines 51–52), the personal deities are angry, but the supplicant is not con-
scious of guilt or negligence (line 68). Foster, 604, understands the line as a direct address
to the personal deities. As they are obviously not addressed in the following line 68, this
singular change of direction of speech is improbable.
mīnâ ēpuš ilī u ištarī anāku
Line 68: Kī, “as, like.” Palāḫu, “to fear, to revere.” The 1cs predicative elides the final
vowel (epšēku becomes epšēk).
kī lā pāliḫ ilī u ištarī anāku epšēk
Line 69: Diʾu, “headache.” Ḫuluqqû (ḫuluqqāʾu), “loss.” Šaḫluqtu, see line 37.
šaknūnim-ma murṣu diʾi ḫuluqqû u šaḫluqti
Line 70: Pardāti: Zgoll, 46 reads per-da-a-ti; but as the first sign can also be read as
par, the word pardāti, a fem. plural. form of pardu, “afraid, fearful; frightening,” is also
possible. The adj. is used as a noun here, “terror, fright.” Suḫḫuru, “to turn away, toward.”𒌋𒐊 A S HUILLA : I SHTAR 2, “T HE G REAT I SHTAR P RAYER ”

Libbātu, “rage, fury.” The infinitives are bound to the following nouns.
šaknāni pardāti suḫḫur pānī u malê libbāti
Line 71: Uzzu, “anger.” Uggatu, “rage, fury.” Sibsatu (šibsatu), “anger, angry rejec-
tion.” Amēlūtu (amīlūtu), “humanity.” This enumeration of further pains is also dependent
on šaknāni in line 70.
uzzu uggati sibsat ilī u amēlūti
Line 72: UD (or U 4 ) = ūmu, “day.” Ukkulu, “very dark.” ITI = (w)arḫu, “month.” Nan-
duru (naʾduru), “darkened, obscured, eclipsed.” MU = šattu, “year.” Niziqtu, “worry, grief.”
Again, the motif of seeing and eye contact is taken up: the supplicant looks back and be-
holds (amāru) their suffering, whereas they hope to see (amāru) Ishtar’s face. Note the
other instances of amāru in lines 41, 43, and 101.
ātamar bēltī ūmī ukkulūti arḫī nandurūti šanāti ša niziqti
Line 73: Šipṭu, see line 13. Išītu (ešītu), “confusion.” Saḫmaštu, “rebellion, uprising.”
ātamar bēltī šipṭa išīti u saḫmašti
Line 74: Mūtu, “death.” Šapšāqu, “constraint, hardship.” Kullu (D), “to hold, to hold
back.” The supplicant is already in the sphere of death. In line 73, they are the subject of a
verb for the last time in the complaint section. Here in line 74, they themselves are men-
tioned for the last time. In the following lines, the supplicant has grammatically vanished
and is present only in nouns that have a 1cs suffix.
ukallânni mūtu u šapšāqu
Line 75: Šuḫarruru, “to be deathly still.” Sagû (sāgu), “cella, shrine.” Aširtu (ešertu),
“chapel, shrine.” The verb appears as a predicative in both instances (3ms and 3fs).
šuḫarrur sagêya šuḫarrurat aširtī
Line 76: UGU : see line 8. KÁ = bābu, “gate, door.” Qarbatu (qerbetu), “environs, mead-
owland, field.” Šaqummatu, “deathly silence.” Tabāku, “to pour out.”
eli bīti bābi qarbātīya šaqummati tabkat
Line 77: Ašaršanimma (ašaršani), “anywhere else.” See also lines 67–68 and 70.

Line 78: Sapāḫu, “to scatter, to disperse.” Illatu, “family, group, clan.” Tabīnu, “shel-
ter.” Purruru (D of parāru), “to scatter, to smash.” The first complaint in this line is taken
up as a petition in line 89 (sapiḫtu illatī lipḫur).
sapḫat illatī tabīnī purrur
Line 79: GEŠTU = uznu, “ear, wisdom, understanding.” Both preterites can be under-
stood as performatives (see line 1). With this line, the attention turns back from the suffer-
ing of the supplicant to Ishtar. See the relation to line 14 (puqqu D). At the beginning of
the first invocation (line 1) and the first petition (line 42), the act of praying is mentioned.
In line 79, at the beginning of the second petition (lines 79–102), the main stress lies at
first on the awaiting of Ishtar’s reaction.
upaqqa ana bēltīya kâši ibšāki uznāya
Line 80: Kâši, “to you,” is redundant with the pronominal suffix (–ki) on the verb; it
probably serves to emphasize the supplicant’s calling out to the deity and it underlines the
shift of attention from the supplicant back to the deity. Eʾiltu (iʾiltu), “bond, liability, sin.”
Paṭāru , “to release, to absolve.” Now the act of praying is mentioned with direct reference
to the very beginning of the prayer (line 1: usallīki bēlet bēlēti ilat ilāti). Only here does it
become evident that the supplicant feels guilty despite the plea to the contrary in line 68.
In line 81, however, there is a whole catalogue of terms for sin and guilt, which has paral-
lels in other prayers (see Mayer, UFBG, 115, n.93.).
usallīki kâši eʾiltī puṭrī
Line 81: Arnu, “guilt, penalty, fault, sin.” Šērtu, “guilt, offense, punishment.” Gillatu,
“sin.” Ḫiṭītu, “act of negligence, sin, offense.”
puṭrī arnī šērtī gillatī u ḫiṭītī
Line 82: Mêšu, “to disregard.” Išītu, see line 73. See also line 43.
mēšī gillātīya [gloss: išītīya] leqê unnīnīya
Line 83: Ru-um-mi-ia is to be read as rummî (D impv. from ramû, “to release, to un-
lock”), a late Babylonian writing, see šadî in line 11 (Zgoll, 65). Kīsu, “bonds, binding.”
Šubarrû, “freedom from service obligations,” with a 1cs suffix.

Line 84: Kibsu, “step, track, route.” Namriš, “brilliantly, brightly.” Etelliš, “like a lord.”
Itti, “with.” The verb šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), here as an imperative, is used twice in the
first invocation to characterize Ishtar’s action towards mankind (see lines 2 and 26). The
petition in this line refers back to these praises and shows the interconnection between the
different parts of the prayer. LÚ . TI (or LÚ . TÌL ) = balṭu, an adj. meaning “alive, safe and
sound.” In its substantival use, it means “living person.” Compare mītu in line 40. SILA =
sūqu, “street.”
šutēširī kibsī namriš etelliš itti balṭūti lubāʾ sūqa
Line 85: Qibītu, “command, order.” Zenû, “angry.” Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace.”
Note the repetition of the root qabû, which is not translated concordantly. A variant in
another textual witness ( MS C: ilī ša iznû: “my god who was angry,” see Zgoll, 46) makes
clear that the personal god is meant.
qibî-ma ina qibītīki ilu zenû lislim
Line 86: In correspondence to the previous line, d 15 is best understood as a substan-
tive (ištaru, “goddess”) and not as Ishtar’s name. Unfortunately, MS C, the alternative tex-
tual witness in line 85, is broken here. Târu, “to return, to turn back, to relent.”
ištaru ša isbusa litūra
Line 87: Eṭû, “dark.” Qatru, “smoky.” Namāru (nawārum), “to become bright.” Kinūnu,
“brazier.” This and the following lines describe a state of darkness but petition for light
and warmth. See the praise of Ishtar’s astral aspects in the first invocation (see, e.g., lines
5, 35, and 37–38).
eṭû qatru limmir kinūnī
Line 88: Belû (m), belītu (f), “extinguished.” Nanpuḫu (N of napāḫu), “be ignited.”
Dipāru, see line 35.

Line 90: TÙR = tarbaṣu, “pen, enclosure, courtyard.” Rapāšu, “to be(come) broad,
wide.” Supūru, “sheepfold.” Šutaddulu (Dt of šadālu), “to be widened, broadened.” Lištamdil
is a 3cs precative, with reduplication via nasalisation (–dd– becomes –md–); see GAG §96j.
The final –u, as with other cases in this late Babylonian MS , is superfluous.
tarbaṣu lirpiš lištamdilu supūrī
Line 91: Magāru generally means “to consent, to agree,” but in this context of suppli-
cation it means “to hear, to grant.” The expression lebēn appa is not usually translated
literally (“stroking of the nose”), see CAD L, 11 (sub labānu), “to beg humbly, to exhibit
utmost humility (in gestures), to pray contritely.” It is usually found in the context of ges-
tures of praying, its function is to praise the gods and to accept their might; see Zgoll, 65;
Zernecke, 84 n.51. Supû, “prayer, supplication.”
mugrī lebēn appīya šimê supêya
Line 92: See lines 44 and 54. According to the first edition, “the second half of the
line has been deeply erased by the scribe” (King, pl. LXXXIII). Several translations com-
plete the line with “accept my supplication” (see, e.g., King, 1.235; Stephens, 385).
kīniš naplisīnnī-ma [...]
Line 93: See lines 56 and 59 for adi mati and line 85 for zenû, which is used predica-
tively here (2fs). In line 77, the same expression is used for the averted face of the person-
al deity (suḫḫurū pānū). Only here, at the end of the prayer, the supplicant can explicitly
mention Ishtar’s wrath. It is a distinctive feature of this prayer that her anger is not “cam-
ouflaged” in a subordinate clause (see Zgoll, 65, 93; Mayer, UFBG, 96, n.58).
adi mati bēltī zenâtī-ma suḫḫurū pānūki
Line 94: Raʾbu, “raging.” Uzzuzu (D of ezēzu), “to make furious,” but in the predica-
tive, “be infuriated.”
adi mati bēltī raʾbātī-ma uzzuzat kabtatki
Line 95: SIG 5 = damiqtu, “good, kind”; see line 53. Tirrī is a fs impv. from turru (D of
târu), “to turn, to bend.” Kišādu, “neck.” Ta-ad-di-ia is a late Babylonian writing for taddî
(see also lines 11 and 83; Zgoll, 65). The form is a G preterite from nadû, “to throw,” but
in reference to a body part it frequently means “to drop.” Amātu (awātum), “word, matter.”
Šakānu with pānū as the object, “to set the face,” means “to intend, to decide.”

Line 96: A . MEŠ = mû, “water.” ÍD = nāru, “river, watercourse, canal.” For the second
half of the line, see line 45. It is not clear to which act the reconciliation of the feelings is
compared in the first half of the line. Pa-šìr can be analysed as a G predicative or participle
of pašāru. Tertium comparationis is the water, but it is not clear if the water is calm, flow-
ing, or cleansing by flowing, or if this is a reference to the “undoing water” (mû pāširūtu)
from namburbi-rituals. The translation follows Zgoll’s, “wie (durch) Wasser, den ‘Löser’ des
Flusses,” who also offers a list of previous translations (53, 65–66). CAD P, 252–53 analyz-
es the word as pāširu, an adjective of uncertain meaning, and lists this passage together
with the namburbi references.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
A text of such length and depth as Ishtar 2 comprises many aspects that
could be compared to biblical texts and their problems. Only two shall be men-
tioned here: an interesting structural parallel concerning the end of the prayer
and the two stages of use of this text. 1
The “Sudden Change of Mood”—A Structural Parallel. 2 A sudden transition
from complaints and petitions to praise and promise to praise at the end of the
text, the so-called sudden change of mood (“Stimmungsumschwung”), is a char-
acteristic feature of certain psalms of lament, though its interpretation is debat-
ed. One hypothesis reconstructs an oracle of salvation, which would have been
spoken by a priest, between the complaints and the praise. 3 The alternative in-
terpretation explains the change of mood within the course of the prayer: de-
spite describing a god-forsaken situation, the supplicant hopes that God is near
during their time of despair. On this line of interpretation complaints and peti-
tions are enriched by elements of trust; the elements of continuity between com-
plaint and praise are stressed. 4
As there is also a sudden change of mood in the prayers of the lifting of the
hand, it is strange that they have only rarely been used within this debate in Old
Testament scholarship. In this point, it is possible to compare the texts, and the
analogy is significant. The ritual instructions of the Mesopotamian prayers allow
one to draw conclusions about the ritual context of the recitation. Ishtar 2 hopes
for Ishtar’s verbal action, her “word of salvation,” in favor of the supplicant. But
there is no evidence that this word of salvation was “performed” in any way
within the ritual procedure.
1
Further comparative discussion concerning Ishtar 2 can be found in Zernecke, 276–362.
See ibid., 306–15.
3
The first prominent development of this hypothesis is Joachim Begrich, “Das priesterliche
Heilsorakel,” ZAW 52 (1934), 81–92.

Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 2006), 77–84.
2280In both types of prayer the final praise has two different functions, one for
the relation between supplicant and deity and the other for the supplicant only.
The promise and the appeal to praise can be understood as “offer of service” by
the supplicant to the deity. They do not only promise to praise but to function
themselves as living examples of divine action. Such an unequivocal “offer of
service” can also be found in biblical texts. Note the appeal to Yahweh to save
the supplicant from the underworld, since no-one praises him there (see Ps 6:6,
30:10, 88:11–12, Isa 38:18). Such an offer can be understood within the concep-
tion of the prayer as audience, which is important at least for the prayers of the
lifting of the hand. 5 The gift as greeting in an actual audience (corresponding to
the offering in the hand-lifting ritual), the proskynesis, and the praise of the ele-
vated person aim at obligating the elevated person to help. The structure of the
audience—and the prayer respectively—want to make the counterpart accept
the petition. Because of the logic of reciprocity governing audiences in the an-
cient Near East, it is possible that the praying person already gives thanks and
praise though their situation is still the same.
The concluding praise has a second but different function for the suppli-
cant. 6 At the end of the prayer, they envision the power of the deity. They bring
to mind the deity they experience as turned away, hoping that the god will act
on their behalf. The certainty of salvation is realized in advance by articulating
it. In this context, the basic character of the prayers as set forms, not as individ-
ual expression has to be kept in mind: praise and promise to praise that antici-
pate the salvation can strengthen the trust of the supplicant in the saving power
of the deity. In this way, their function can be compared to the functions of the
expressions of confidence in the psalms of lament and the hymnic invocation in
the prayers of the lifting of the hand. The form invites the supplicant to leave
behind the fixation on their own needs and to rest in the saving action by the
deity. This structure can be compared to “de-reflection” in its psychotherapeutic
sense. Prayers of the lifting of the hand can lead back from the final praise into
the initial invocation in repeated recitations; psalms of lament can proceed from
complaint to praise. The sudden change of mood can be interpreted as an ele-
ment of “pastoral care” in both cases, independent of the different structures of
the prayers.
The form of the sudden change of mood in Ishtar 2 is special: there is not
only a promise to praise (lines 101–102) but the anticipated praise itself in the
final section of the prayer (lines 103–105). These last three lines could well be
set in quotation marks. This phenomenon is attested in other Mesopotamian
prayers, too, 7 but also in biblical laments of the individual. A striking example is

rituale. Mit einer Deutung der Novelle vom Armen Mann von Nippur,” BaghM 34 (2003), 181–203

281
Ps 22, a long psalm of individual lament, in which the section of complaint,
mixed with petitions and expressions of confidence (Ps 22:2–22), is followed by
elements of a thanksgiving psalm: a double promise of praise (Ps 22:23, 26) and
its fulfillment (Ps 22:24–25, 27). 8 This “mixture of genres” has been interpreted
as indicating that the “true” genres and their Sitze im Leben were not valid any-
more at the time of writing; therefore, Ps 22 was considered “nachkultisch,” not
as prayer, but as “Gebetsliteratur” (prayer literature). 9 The parallel of Ishtar
2:101–105 makes it possible to understand Ps 22:23–27 as promise to praise and
anticipated praise without necessitating the use of source criticism. 10
The history of use. 11 The tablet BM 26187 ( MS A) only contains Ishtar 2. Its
colophon (lines 112–113 in Zgoll’s edition; line 111 gives the beginning of the
prayer Ishtar 3) can be translated as follows: “A copy from Borsippa. According
to its original. Nergal-balassu-iqbi, son of Atamar-KAL.ME, ritual expert (āšipu),
has written (it) for his life, checked (it) through and permanently deposited (it)
in Esagila.”
This colophon contains information about the scribe and the use he made of
this particular copy of the prayer. Nergal-balassu-iqbi, the scribe, was a ritual
expert (āšipu). 12 He deposited the tablet in Esagila, the temple of Marduk in Bab-
ylon, “for his life.” Thus, this tablet is a votive offering of one of the persons
who transmitted and executed this kind of ritual and was never meant to be
used for the execution of the ritual written down on it with all of the practical
instructions. The Sitz im Leben of the text inscribed on the tablet therefore is not
identical with its use. The use has changed; in this special case, it is part of the
“private piety” of a ritual expert.
In all probability, most psalms were not written for the collection of the
Book of Psalms, but independently, and were collected and arranged after-
wards—possibly also for “private piety” in the post-exilic period. 13 The two stag-
es of usage of Ishtar 2 are an interesting parallel to the development of the con-
textualization of the Psalms.

Ps 22:28–32 seem to be a later addition which enlarges the praising people in time and space;

A Shuilla: Marduk 4
A LAN L ENZI
M ARDUK :
Marduk was the local god of the city of Babylon. He eventually replaced En-
lil as the chief god of the Mesopotamian pantheon. Although he had many
names, Bēl, “lord,” best conveys Marduk’s ultimate position in Mesopotamian
religious thought. Marduk’s shrine in Babylon was called É-sag-íl, “the house
with uplifted head,” and his ziggurat was É-temen-an-ki, “house of the founda-
tion platform of heaven and the netherworld.” Zarpanitu was Marduk’s consort;
Nabu was his son.
There is some dispute about the etymology and meaning of Marduk’s name.
The common logographic writing d AMAR . UTU may represent Sumerian amar-utu-
a(k). (Whether this is a genuine Sumerian etymology or a folk etymology, that
is, an indigenous attempt to explain an incomprehensible pre-Sumerian name
with Sumerian, is a matter of speculation and ultimately moot.) Some have
translated amar-utu-a(k) as “calf of the Sun (god)” (Lambert, 8) and others as
“calf of the storm” (Abusch, 543). In any case, the Sumerian etymology suggests
the early name of the deity (i.e., in the OB period) was Marūtuk or Marūtu,
which may have been shortened in later periods to Martuk / Marduk. But the
lack of unambiguous syllabic spellings of the name (e.g., d ma-ar- instead of the
typical d mar(u)-) 1 sheds some doubt on the existence of this short form as do
Hebrew and Greek transliterations of the name in the biblical tradition (e.g., Jer
50:2 MT : ‫ְך‬ ‫ֹד‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ‫;מ‬
Jer 27:2 LXX : μαρωδαχ). 2
Although Marduk is probably attested as early as the third millennium in
texts from Fara (ancient Shuruppak) and Abu Salabikh, 3 we can only begin to
trace his veneration in the OB period. Originally, Marduk was a rather insignifi-
cant local god from the city of Babylon, perhaps associated with justice (so

See Lambert, 7, who notes the increased use of CVCV signs in post-Kassite Akkadian and thus
the ambiguity of writings with mar.
2
Note also the spelling of the name in Ashurbanipal’s acrostic hymn to Marduk (ma-ru-du-uk).
See Alasdair Livingstone, Court Poetry and Literary Miscellanea (SAA 3; Helsinki: Helsinki Univer-
sity Press, 1989), no. 2, rev. 1, 3, 6, and 8.

The interpretation of these texts is disputed. Compare Sommerfeld, “Marduk,” 363 and Lam-
bert, 8.
291292Sommerfeld, 364), thunderstorms (so Abusch, 544), or canal digging (so Oshi-
ma). With the advent of Hammurabi in the early eighteenth century BCE and the
meteoric rise of Babylon as a political and cultural power, Marduk was elevated
to a position among the high gods of the pantheon. This is clearly evidenced by
the opening lines of the Code of Hammurabi as well as by Marduk’s growing
popularity as the theophoric element in personal names. 4 Although he was not
made the head of the pantheon in the OB period, Marduk’s prominence was se-
cured at this time and his cult spread to several other cities.
Marduk’s rise to the head of the pantheon is probably first officially recog-
nized during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I (1125–1104 BCE ), who unified post-
Kassite Babylonia and recovered Marduk’s statue from the Elamites, who had
carried it off a generation earlier. 5 Mythologically speaking, Marduk’s rise is
recounted in the Enūma eliš, which may date to this period (though the dating of
Enūma eliš continues to elicit debate). In this well-known myth the gods send
Marduk to defeat the raging Tiamat and her minions. As a reward for this heroic
exploit, the gods crown him king of the gods (see IV 28 and V 110). After Mar-
duk creates the cosmos and forms humanity, the gods build him a temple, Esagil,
and a ziggurat, Etemenanki, in Babylon. The myth concludes with a long section
in which the gods pronounce Marduk’s fifty names. The founding of Babylon in
this myth was clearly intended to replace the former central sanctuary of Meso-
potamia, Nippur, the seat of Enlil. Giving Marduk fifty names was a piece of
theological revisionism to position Marduk as the replacement of Enlil (whose
divine number was 50). 6
Throughout the first millennium, Marduk was honored as the chief god of
the Mesopotamian pantheon, even recognized as such by the Assyrians in their
royal inscriptions. This prominence was celebrated in an unparalleled manner
during the Neo-Babylonian empire and later employed politically by the Persians
to legitimize their conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE (see The Cyrus Cylinder 7 ).
Although the cult of Marduk suffered a major set back when Alexander failed to
rebuild Marduk’s destroyed temple complex, Marduk (Bel) was still revered in
the Hellenistic and Parthian periods.
4
Sommerfeld has shown that the use of Marduk as a theophoric element in personal names sky-
rocketed between the early and late OB periods, so much so that he thinks it likely that nearly
every family had a member bearing a name formed on Marduk (“Marduk,” 364).

A similar attempt is probably attested in the god list AN = d Anum, where Marduk is given fifty
names (some of which are different from those in Enūma eliš). See Richard L. Litke, A Reconstruc-
tion of the Assyro-Babylonian God-Lists, AN : d an-nu-um and AN : anu ša amēli (Texts from the

Marduk was associated and then identified with a god named Asalluḫi (As-
arluḫi), a move that started in the early OB period and was completed by Kassite
times. 8 Since Asalluḫi was the son of Ea, god of wisdom and magic, this identifi-
cation resulted in linking Marduk (and therefore Babylon) to the ancient and
prestigious pantheon of Eridu, which gave Marduk, who was previously an in-
significant deity, a legitimate place in the high levels of the Mesopotamian pan-
theon and bolstered his authority. 9 It is no accident therefore to see Marduk’s
birth to Ea (and Damkina) depicted in Enūma eliš I 79–108. 10 We know that
Marduk became an important god of magic and exorcism. What is not complete-
ly clear is whether this status suggested his eventual identification with Asalluḫi
or whether it was the result of his association with Asalluḫi and/or Ea. For more
about Asalluḫi, see page 403.
In iconography Marduk was symbolized by a pointed spade and associated
with a snake-dragon (mušḫuššu). Jupiter was his astrological representation.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer shows the three typical structural elements of a shuilla-prayer,
hymnic introduction, petition, and concluding praise, but it implements these in
an unusual manner, probably under the influence of ershaḫunga-prayers.
The prayer opens with an unusually short invocation and hymnic introduc-
tion; in fact, its two lines form one of the shortest hymns attested among shuilla-
prayers.
The petition section of the prayer is also unusual in size, accounting for all
but a couple of the text’s remaining lines (3–27, 29–39). This section divides
into several smaller units that may be characterized successively as complaint,
protest, and petition. An introductory complaint in lines 3–6 is followed by the
supplicant’s protestation of human fallibility and ignorance in lines 8–15—an
unusual theme for a shuilla but attested in ershaḫungas (see page 449). 11 A sec-
ond invocation in line 7 bridges the two units. A unique and very brief self-
presentation formula (line 16a) stands at the head of the first section of petitions
(lines 16b–27). A second section of petitions, whose leitmotif is anticipated by
line 19b, occurs in lines 29–39. This section consists of a seven-fold, repetitive
litany in which the supplicant pleads for forgiveness of sin (lines 29–37) and a
couplet in which the supplicant seeks the restoration of parent-like divine favor

See Mayer’s edition, 199, who notes parallels with ershaḫungas and several other kinds of
prayers, including a “literary prayer” to Marduk, for which, see W. G. Lambert, “Three Literary
Prayers of the Babylonians,” AfO 19 (1959/1960), 47–66, here 57:105–110. Translations of the
latter are in Foster, 611–16, Seux, 172–81, von Soden, 270–72, and Hecker, TUAT II/5, 754–58.
9294(lines 38–39). Both of these elements reflect the concluding sections of the er-
shaḫunga-prayers (compare the ending of the prayer at page 448, n.5 and see
the general introduction, page 46); they do not normally occur in Akkadian
shuillas. 12
Lines 28 and 40 bracket this second section of petitions and together form a
disjointed promise of praise that concludes the prayer. This discontinuous con-
cluding praise might suggest that lines 29–39 are a secondary insertion in the
prayer. 13 Given the manner in which incantation-prayers were adjusted and
adapted for various purposes, this is not an implausible suggestion, but it is not
currently supported by the evidence at hand (i.e., we do not have a MS lacking
the litany). Rather than evidence for literary accretion, it seems more likely that
the disjointed promise of praise points to the influence of another structural fea-
ture of the ershaḫungas. As mentioned in the general introduction, the er-
shaḫunga-prayers may include a transitional statement that leads into the inter-
cessory litany; this transition may include praise to the deity. Given this and the
affinities mentioned above, it is likely that the text of this prayer was influenced
by typical features of both the shuilla- and ershaḫungas-prayers.
Three elements frame the prayer: the invocation qarrādu Marduk, “O warri-
or Marduk,” in line 1 and line 40; the parental imagery in line 2 (abu) and lines
38–39 (abi ālidīya, ummi ālittīya); and the contrasting imagery of the supplicant
as an old man (šību) in line 6 and as a youth (ṣeḫērīya) in line 36. Two of these
framing elements also appear in the middle of the text: the parental / familial
terms appear in lines 22–23 and the supplicant’s youth mentioned in line 18.
Furthermore, the qarrādu Marduk invocation occurs again at line 30. All of these
features lend literary coherence to the prayer.
The three-fold repetition of the invocation qarrādu Marduk, “O warrior
Marduk,” in lines 1, 30, and 40 may help bind this rather complex and atypical
prayer into a unit. But Hunt (90–91) argues that this epithet may also shed light
on the prayer’s literary development. Because he believes qarrādu is superfluous
in the opening hymn (i.e., it has no parallel in line 2) and absent in a (supposed)
citation of the prayer’s incipit in a letter from an exorcist (ABL 716 = SAA 18,
no. 181, rev. 25), he suggests the epithet may have been inserted into line 1 to
give unity to the prayer after the petitionary litany in lines 29–39 had been, in
his opinion, added. Although this is an interesting idea, the evidence is not
strong enough to support it. First, Hunt’s poetic understanding of lines 1–2 is
open to question. Qarrādu may not have a parallel term in line 2 but neither
does Marduk’s name; the parallelism between lines 1–2 lies in ša ezissu abūbu 
napšuršu abu rēmēnû. Since qarrādu Marduk was a commonly used phrase to de-
scribe Marduk (see CAD Q, 141), it may have been understood as a single epi-
thet here, whose lack of parallel in line 2 was intended to give the deity’s invo-
cation prominence in this first line of the prayer. Second, the assumed absence

295
of the word qarrādu in the citation of the prayer’s incipit may be a mistaken
assumption. Perhaps the writer of the letter who cited the incipit simply left
qarrādu out due to a memory lapse or because the word did not fit his rhetorical
purpose. If one looks at the context of the letter, the writer is alluding to attrib-
utes of Marduk to flatter the king; he is not explicitly citing an incipit to pre-
scribe a prayer. In fact, it may well be that he was not alluding to this prayer at
all. Rather, he may have been simply using epithets of Marduk that also occur in
our prayer to flatter the king. It is clear that our prayer has been influenced by
features of ershaḫunga-prayers. But the evidence is still too slight and ambigu-
ous to posit this influence occurred after the initial composition of the prayer
rather than at the time of it.
The prayer turns thematically on a single idea, forgiveness of sins, and
therefore recalls the themes of the ershaḫunga- and dingirshadibba-prayers, both
of which are penitential in nature. 14 Although the supplicant confesses sin in
lines 16–18 and 36, they also present three general reasons for sin—not to ex-
cuse their disobedience but to garner mercy and avert punishment. First, lines 8–
15, the protest section, depict humans as frail and ignorant, living and working
under a divine economy that makes human sin practically inevitable. The prayer
seems to ask implicitly, How could the supplicant not sin in such a world? Sec-
ond, the prayer mentions the issue of adolescent sins twice (lines 18 and 36). In
these cases, the supplicant seems to request forbearance for immature mistakes.
Finally, inherited sin or collective guilt finds a place in the prayer in lines 22–24.
The supplicant does not plead their family’s innocence in these lines. Rather,
they wish to avert personal responsibility for the sins and ask that the sins’ ill
effect go elsewhere. Throughout the long petitionary section of the prayer, one
sees a supplicant striving to cover the gamut of reasons for culpability, includ-
ing, significantly, the mention of inadvertent sin in line 18b. Such broad cover-
age of possibilities is clearly due to the supplicant’s ignorance of a precise cause
for the misfortune that has come their way, a common motif in Mesopotamian
religious texts. 15
But all is not darkness and gloom. There is reason for hope, which peeks
through in line 40, in the very existence of the prayer itself: for if there was no
hope for the supplicant to change the situation, there would be no reason to use
the divinely-inspired shuilla.
Two MSS preserve varying ritual instructions. Mayer’s MS A is followed here.
MS A also preserves a catchline to Marduk 9 (see Mayer, UFBG, 396) after our
line 45 and before the tablet’s colophon.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer but is not a part of the prayer itself. It may have been read as Sumerian rather
than Akkadian. The prayer opens with a very short hymnic introduction that invokes Mar-
duk with appropriate divine epithets. Qarrādu, “hero, warrior.” Qarrādu is a very common
epithet for male deities (see CAD Q, 141–42). d AMAR . UTU = Marduk. Ezēzu, “to be(come)
angry, furious.” Ezissu is a 3ms predicative plus 3ms (resumptive) pronominal suffix, which
literally means “his being angry,” that is, Marduk’s present state of rage. It is best rendered
by “his anger.” The pronominal suffix resumes the relative pronoun ša at the head of the
phrase (ša ezissu abūbu). Abūbu, “flood,” is often used metaphorically to characterize the
inexorable power of a deity’s anger, a king’s military actions, or either’s weapons (see CAD
A/1, 78–79).
šiptu: qarrādu Marduk ša ezissu abūbu
Line 2: Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to be reconciled to, to forgive.” Abu,
“father.” Rēmēnû, “merciful.” (Gula is called “merciful [rēmēnû] mother” on page 246.)
Abu, a positive image here, plays on the negative abūbu in line 1. The use of eziz and
napšur here at the beginning of the prayer recalls the second line in the opening hymn of
Ludlul bēl nēmeqi (see page 486): eziz mūši muppašir urri, “he is angry at night but relenting
at daybreak” (I 2). As mentioned by Hunt (89), it is significant that the merciful aspect of
Marduk’s character lies closest to the petitionary part of the prayer that follows.
napšuršu abu rēmēnû
Line 3: This line begins the complaint section of the prayer. Qabû, “to speak, to com-
mand, to decree.” Lā, “not,” is the particle used to negate individual substantives. Šemû,𒌋𒐋 A S HUILLA : M ARDUK 4

re-mé-nu-ú
“to hear.” The infinitives are being used as nouns here (more specifically, as gerunds),
“speaking and not hearing.” Ineffective speech, to speak an unheeded word, is a common
Mesopotamian concern. When in the context of other humans, this anxiety may be related
to a (perceived) loss of communal respect or self-esteem. In a context of divine communi-
cation, the supplicant expresses worries that his petitions are ignored. The heavens have
become brass. Dalāpu, “to keep someone awake, to stir up, to harrass.” The –dd– in the
verb is the result of an assimilation of the perfect’s infixed –t– to the first letter of the root.
See also the verb in line 4. (One exemplar of the prayer inserts a still very fragmentary line
between lines 3 and 4. All that is preserved is the word iššaknūni, “they are placed here for
me.” See Mayer, 201.)
qabû u lā šemû iddalpanni
Line 4: Šasû, “to shout, to call out.” Apālu, “to answer.” Dâṣu, “to treat with injustice,
to treat with disrespect.” With perfect grammatical parallelism, line 4 restates line 3; se-
mantically speaking, however, the two lines bear witness to an intensifying of the anxiety.
The action in the lines moves from reception of the spoken word (“hearing”) to active
response (“answering”), precisely what the supplicant wants but is not getting. Moreover,
the supplicant’s reaction moves from agitation to a feeling of disrespect.
šasû u lā apālu iddāṣanni
Line 5: Ammatu, literally, “forearm, cubit,” but seems to have a metaphorical mean-
ing here (and only here), “strength” (see CAD A/2, 70, which says the meaning of this
passage is uncertain). Libbu, “heart, mind.” Šūṣû (Š of [w]aṣû), “to cause to go out, to ex-
pel.” Given the odd use of ammatu and its phonological similarities to amātu (awātum),
“word, matter,” one might well wonder if there is a double meaning to this line. The pri-
mary one is clear: the supplicant’s strength is sapped; the secondary one, reading the verb
as a 1cs, is more subtle: the supplicant has revealed the secrets of his heart, presumably to
the god. For amāta šūṣû, “to reveal a matter (i.e., secret),” see CAD A/2, 372–73. On this
reading, line 5 is a sort of conceptual pivot point between lines 3–4 and line 6.
ammatīya ina libbīya uštēṣī-ma
Line 6: Kīma, “like.” Šību, “elder, old person.” Quddudu (D of qadādu), “to bend down,
to bow low.” Although qadādu sometimes describes a gesture of humility, the preceding
line and the simile here (kīma šībi) require us to understand the verb in terms of degenera-
tion of the supplicant’s body. The chain of 3cs perfect verb forms continues into this line,
the last of the complaint section. It is surely significant that three of the four verbs in the
complaint section end with the –anni pronominal suffix.
kīma šībi uqtaddidanni
Line 7: EN = bēlu, “lord.” GAL = rabû (m), “great.” DINGIR = ilu, “god.” Line 7 pro-
vides a transition between the complaint and protest sections of the prayer. This line’s2988. a-me-lu-tu ma-la šu-ma na-bat

vocative, “O great lord Marduk,” is unique within the prayer (compare lines 1, 30, and
40); the attached epithet, “merciful god,” recalls line 2. The epithet Bēl(u) would eventual-
ly become Marduk’s primary name in Babylon.
bēlu rabû Marduk ilu rēmēnû
Line 8: Lines 8–15 form the supplicant’s protest, not of innocence but of human frail-
ty and the divine economy that makes human sin practically inevitable. Compare the simi-
lar ideas about human sinfulness in lines 132–134 of a dingirshadibba (see W. G. Lambert,
“DINGIR.ŠÀ.DIB.BA Incantations,” JNES 33 (1974), 280–83) and other examples cited by
Hunt, 101–4 and Karel van der Toorn, “Theodicy in Akkadian Literature,” in Theodicy in
the World of the Bible: The Goodness of God and the Problem of Evil (ed. Antti Laato and Jo-
hannes C. de Moor; Leiden: Brill, 2003), 62, 72–73. Human ignorance and tendency to sin
is not used as an excuse; rather, they are a basis for the supplicant’s request for divine
mercy and forgiveness. Amēlūtu (amīlūtu, awīlūtum), “humanity, human being, people.”
Mala, “as much as, as many as.” Šumu, “name.” Nabû, “to name.” Mala / ša šuma nabû, is
an idiom for “everything, everyone” (see CAD N/1, 35 for other examples with amēlūtu).
Foster’s “by whatever name” captures the sense and style of the Akkadian idiom nicely
(680). Nabât is fem. because amēlūtu is fem. Line 8 introduces by way of anacoluthon the
referent of mannu, “who?,” in the next several lines.
amēlūtu mala šuma nabât
Line 9: Annu (arnu), “guilt, fault, sin.” Ramānīša, “itself, its own”; the fem. pronomi-
nal suffix refers back to amēlūtu. Mannu, “who?” Lamādu, “to learn, to recognize, to under-
stand.” Lines 9–11 use rhetorical questions (note the use of mannu in each) to emphasize
humanity’s ignorance with regard to their own sins. Prayers often express this idea with
simple statements such as “I do not know my sin” or “my sin which I do not know but you
know” (compare line 18 below). The point is clear: Mesopotamians almost always assumed
some sin was behind the problems they experienced, even when they could not identify it
(see similarly Mayer, 207).

Line 10: Lā, “not,” is also the form of negation used after interrogative pronouns.
Šêṭu, “to miss, to disdain, to be negligent.” Ayû (ajû, ayyu), “who?, which?, what?” Gullulu,
“to commit a sin.” Continuing the rhetorical questions, the line offers two that are both
grammatically and semantically parallel. These raise the stakes laid out in lines 8–9 be-
cause not only is it difficult to know one’s own sins, everyone does it. Everyone sins. For
similar statements in prayers, see the references in Seux, 170, n.10.

human realm (line 9) to the divine (line 11). Alaktu, usually means “way, manner, course,”
but also means “divine decree” in some contexts (see I. Tzvi Abusch, “Alaktu and Hala-
khah: Oracular Decision, Divine Revelation,” HTR 80 [1987], 15–52). If the latter meaning
is correct here, the supplicant may be complaining that the divine will is inscrutable. See
similarly, e.g., the statement in Ludlul II 34–36 (see Amar Annus and Alan Lenzi, Ludlul bēl
nēmeqi: The Standard Babylonian Poem of the Righteous Sufferer (SAACT 7; Helsinki: The
Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2010) , xxi, with other references cited in n.35).
alakti ili mannu ilammad
Line 12: Itʾudu (Gt of naʾādu), “to watch carefully, to observe strictly.” Gullutu, “sin,”
which is cognate to the verb in line 10. Rašû, “to acquire, to gain.” The 1cs precative may
express an indirect command (“I ought”) here (and in line 13) rather than a wish (“let
me”). One’s understanding of the context will determine one’s decision between the two.
In the second half of the line, the lā plus durative indicates a prohibitive (“I may not”).
After painting the big picture of human ignorance, the prayer now focuses in on the indi-
vidual supplicant. The second half of the line presents the result of the supplicant’s actions
in the first half.
luttaʾid-ma gullultu lā arašši
Line 13: Ašru, “place, location”; ašrātu (pl). Balāṭu, “life, health, well-being.” Šiteʾʾû
(Gtn of šeʾû) means “to look all over, to search everywhere” but also “to be assiduous (in
reverence) toward,” especially when used with something like ašrāt ili, “sanctuaries of a
god” (see CAD Š/2, 358–62).
ašrāt balāṭi lušteʾʾī-ma
Line 14: Arratu, “curse.” Ittabbulu (Gtn of [w]abālu), “to look after, to manage, to
direct, to be active.” The form is an inf. DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Qabât is a 3fs predicative
from qabû, which here seems to mean something like “to command, to decree.” The fem.
subject may go back to amēlūtu in line 8 or may simply refer to the general situation de-
scribed in the line (an impersonal “it”); in either case, the focus is pulled away from the
supplicant and back onto a general, rather pessimistic view of humanity’s situation (lines
8–11), as is clear from line 15, which shows why the sentiments of lines 12–13 are so diffi-
cult to implement in real life (see Mayer, 207).

Line 15: Qātu, “hand.” LÚ = amēlu (amīlu, awīlum), “human being, man.” Qāt DN,
“the hand of [a god’s name],” is often used to denote illnesses and diseases (e.g., qāt Ištar).
Here the word may explain arratu in the previous line, meaning something like divine
weight or affliction (see Foster, 681 for the latter option). Babālu, “to carry, to bring,” is a
by-form of (w)abālu, the inf. of which was also used in the previous line (in the Gtn stem).
qāta ša ili ana amēli babālu
Line 16: The self-presentation formula is minimal. ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.”
Servant language is very common in Mesopotamian religious texts. The gods are conceived
as divine kings. Humans are therefore their subjects. Anāku, “I.” This is the only instance
of aradka preceding anāku in a self-presentation formula (see Mayer, UFBG, 49, n.8). Some
MSS preserve the opposite, more typical order (see UFBG, 203, n.16(1)). There are at least
three possible understandings of aradka anāku. The phrase may be understood as a nomi-
nal sentence, “I am your servant.” The two words may be in apposition to one another and
rendered as an introduction to the line, “as for your servant, me.” (More idiomatic English
requires rephrasing: “as for me, your servant.”) Finally, aradka may introduce the line, “as
for your servant,” and anāku may emphasize the first person verb, “I myself, I actually.”
One’s interpretive decision here and in the rest of the line will be based on one’s under-
standing of the larger context. Šettūtu, “sin.” Lū plus preterite may express concession,
“even if, even though,” or affirmation, “indeed, verily” (see also line 17). Epēšu, “to do.”
The prayer returns to focus on the supplicant, who confesses that they have in fact sinned.
aradka anāku šettūtu lū ēpuš
Line 17: Itû, “boundary, border.” Etēqu, “to cross over, to pass through.” Idiomatical-
ly, itâ etēqu means “to trespass, to transgress.” Line 17 provides a second, parallel confes-
sion of sin to that of line 16.
itâ ša ili lū ētiq
Line 18: The restoration here follows Mayer, who also lists and discusses the variants
in the other textual witnesses (203, n.18(1) and 209–10). The line opens with a subordi-
nate clause in which the ša functions substantively, “that which.” We expect the verb to
conclude the clause, but in this poetic context the word order does not follow the norm.
Meṣḫēriš, “in / during childhood, youth.” The supplicant refers back to possible sins com-
mitted earlier in his life. ZU = edû (idû), “to know.” NU = lā, “not.” Here the supplicant
covers both known sins and those unknown to them—a common motif in Mesopotamian
religious texts. The entire subordinate clause forms the object of the main verb, an impera-
tive. Mêšu, “to disregard, to forgive.” We expect the imperative of mêšu (mēš) to appear
without a final vowel. For other instances of the imperative with various final vowels, see
CAD M/2, 42. This line forms the beginning of a long litany of petitions.

Line 19: Libbu, see line 5. Nakādu, literally, “to throb, to pound.” Ina libbīka nakādu
may be understood metaphorically to mean “to worry, to be concerned about.” Paṭāru, “to
loosen, to undo, to release.” Šērtu, “guilt, offence, punishment.” Pašāru, “to loosen, to un-
do, to release.” Both pašāru and paṭāru occur in contexts dealing with the forgiveness of
sins/guilt or the release from sickness/demonic oppression (CAD P, 237–39 and 290–92).
The second half of line 19 anticipates lines 29–35. Volitional forms, here a vetitive (a neg-
ative precative) and two imperatives, continue to dominate the text and will continue to
do so for a number of lines hence. Notice, finally, the consonance and assonance in the
second half of the line.
ina libbīka ayy-ikkud annī puṭur-ma šērtī pušur
Line 20: Lines 20 and 21 seem rather short and probably belong together in one poet-
ic line. Ešû, “unclear, confused, uncertain.” Ešâtīya is a mp verbal adjective with a 1cs
pronominal suffix, “my confused states (of mind)” (similarly dalḫâtīya in line 21). Num-
muru (D of namāru), “to brighten, to illuminate, to clarify, to clear up.” The imperative
requests a reversal of the supplicant’s state of mind (likewise in line 21).
ešâtīya nummer
Line 21: Dalḫu, “troubled, disturbed” (when used of water the word means, “mud-
died,” and of eyes, “blurred”). Zukkû (D of zakû), “to cleanse, to purify, to free.” Lines 20
and 21 show close grammatical and semantic parallelism. Significantly, ešâtu and dalḫâtu
are also both used to describe ambiguous results of divination (“omens are confused”); see,
e.g., CAD E, 378.
dalḫâtīya zukki
Line 22: AD = abu, “father.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix, “my.” AMA = ummu,
“mother.” It is not uncommon for a prayer to add a reference to one’s brother and sister in
such a list of relatives (see line 2 on page 136 for an example in this volume). In fact, three
MSS of the present prayer preserve a longer list that includes them (see Mayer, 203,
n.22(5)). This line and the next form the compound subject of the vetitive in line 24, ayy-
iṭḫâ. The supplicant turns now to deal with sin that may have been inherited from family
members.
anna abīya abi abīya anna ummīya ummi ummīya
Line 23: Kimtu, “family.” Nišūtu, “kin, relatives.” Salātu, “family, clan.” The list of
relatives continues from line 22 but now with collective terms rather than terms for indi-30224. a-na ra-ma-ni-ia a-a TE -a a-ḫi-tam-ma lil-lik

vidual members. Notice how the 1cs pronominal suffixes on each noun in lines 22 and 23
affect the phonological rhythm of the lines.
anna kimtīya nišūtīya u salātīya
Line 24: Ana ramānīya, literally, “to my person, self.” TE = ṭeḫû, “to draw near, to
approach.” The phonetic complement on the logogram (–a) must indicate the ventive.
Aḫītam, “aside, elsewhere,” is an adverb of place. Alāku, “to go.” The two halves of the line
are generally parallel in terms of grammar and semantics. Rather than the supplicant wish-
ing guilt (or its consequences) to be turned toward some other person (e.g., a foreigner or
enemy, aḫû), the supplicant simply wishes it to go away, to go elsewhere (aḫītam alāku).
ana ramānīya ayy-iṭḫâ aḫītam-ma lillik
Line 25: Mayer has collated the witnesses to this line and determined that the reading
previous translators have used (iq-ṭa-ba-an-ni, deriving from King’s copy, BMS 11) is mis-
taken. He takes the first verb as a Š durative of ṭâbu, “to make good, to make favorable,”
with the š changing to l before the dental, rather than taking it as a G perfect of qabû (see
Mayer, 210–11). Due to the non-volitional form of the verb at its head (a durative), previ-
ous translators have usually understood the first half of the line as a subordinate clause,
either conditional (assuming an understood šumma, “if”) or temporal (enūma, “when”). GIM
= kīma, “like.” Ú . KI . KAL = sassatu, “grass.” The supplicant wants to become as pure as
grass. Ubbubu (D of ebēbu), “to cleanse, to purify.” The form is a D impv. with a 1cs object
suffix. Since the other volitional forms in the immediate context are directed to Marduk, it
seems likely that the final verb in this line is, too. One might identify the god mentioned in
the first half of the line as either Marduk or the supplicant’s personal god. The latter may
seem more likely given the generic and personal manner of reference: ilī, “my god” (thus
Mayer, 206). But one does not expect Marduk to wait on a personal god’s actions to act
upon the supplicant’s petition (ubbibanni, “purify me”). Moreover, the supplicant asks
Marduk to entrust them to the hands of the personal deities in the very next line. The sup-
plicant therefore does not seem to be in any position just yet to place hope in the actions
of the personal god. Finally, one might wonder if the orthography for ilī, ì-lí = NI-NI, pre-
served in one MS (another reads DINGIR . MU ), was intentionally used to differentiate between
Marduk and the personal god, who is referred to in the next line with the more typical
logogram DINGIR . (For different understandings of the line, see, e.g., Hunt, 122–24 and
Seux, 171, n.27.)

= ištarī, “my goddess.” Šalmu, “peace, well-being.” TI . LA = balāṭu, “life, health, well-
being.” Paqādu + ana, “to entrust, to hand over something to someone.” The supplicant
continues to petition the deity for favor. In this case, he requests the deity to entrust them
into the hands of their personal god and goddess. It is significant that the text specifies
“the favorable hands” of the deities. The working assumption in the prayer may be that𒌋𒐋 A S HUILLA : M ARDUK 4

the supplicant was not on the best of terms with the personal deities. They now ask Mar-
duk to set that relationship aright. The imagery of the “hand of a god” here and in line 15
presents a significant contrast.
ana qātī damqāti ša ilīya u ištarīya ana šalme u balāṭi piqdanni
Line 27: Ikribū, “prayers, votive offerings” (for a discussion of the nuances of this
term, see CAD I/J, 66). Teslītū, “petitions, requests.” Tēmēqū (tēmīqū), “deep prayers, well-
conceived presentations of a case” (see CAD T, 335). Dāriš, “forever.” Izuzzu, “to stand, to
serve,” has here a dative 2ms pronominal suffix, “to, for you.” Having addressed their
position with regard to their personal deities, the supplicant now attends to their relation-
ship to Marduk. They wish to stand before him in perpetual supplication. Standing before
another is a sign of one’s subservience. This fits the relationship between deity and suppli-
cant perfectly (see line 16, aradka). Perpetual supplication may seem obsequious, but one
might also consider this wish from another standpoint: uninterrupted access. To have con-
stant communicative access with the deity would be a great privilege and a means for
insuring one’s security. Contrast this desire with the problem mentioned in line 3.
ikribē teslītī u tēmēqī dāriš luzzizku
Line 28: Nišū (f), “people, populace.” Dešû, “abundant, numerous.” The precise syn-
tactical function of KUR = mātu, “country, land,” and the relative clause that it governs is
unclear. It may be in apposition to nišū dešâtu, “abundant people,” at the head of the line.
It may modify nišū dešâtu somehow: “the abundant people (living in, of, from) the land. . .”
(see CAD D, 129 and Š/1, 148). Or, it may functional adverbially, specifying where the
people offer their praise: “let the abundant people praise you (in) the land. . . .” Ašru, see
line 13. Šakānu, “to put, to establish, to set up.” The nuanced meaning of the relative
phrase ša ina ašri šaknat, literally, “which is set in (its) place,” is also unclear (see Mayer,
211). The CAD suggests “which is well organized” (D, 129 and N/1, 102) or “which is well
established” (Š/1, 148). AHw suggests “which lies on the earth” (83, see likewise, Hunt,
127–28), but understanding ašru as “earth” is unique. Nâdu, “to praise.” The final verb is
actually the first word in line 29, but it only makes sense if it is considered a part of line
28. The supplicant now broadens their view and wishes that a large body of people will
also honor Marduk with their praise. The implication is that the people will see what Mar-
duk has done for the supplicant and join in their thanksgiving. The same idea is presented
explicitly and more fully in Ludlul IV 69–82 (according to the line numbers of SAACT 7).
This line seems to lead naturally into line 40, the final line of the prayer.
nišū dešâtu māti ša ina ašri šaknat linādūka
Line 29: This line begins a seven-fold petition for forgiveness of sin. The supplicant
begins here with a general request, presumably directed to Marduk. All of the ones to
follow will be directed to a specifically invoked deity. It may be surprising to see the issue30430. UR . SAG d AMAR . UTU an-ni

of forgiveness resurface after the wish for widespread praise of the deity in line 28. But the
prayer seems to be under the influence of the ershaḫunga’s form (see the introduction to
this prayer). For annu, paṭāru, and pašāru, see lines 9 and 19. Annu is consistently written
with the 1cs pronominal suffix in the following lines.
annī puṭur annī pušur
Line 30: UR . SAG = qarrādu. See line 1 for this epithet. Although the prayer is already
directed to Marduk, the supplicant re-invokes Marduk, echoing the opening words of the
prayer, and asks him to forgive their sins. This line seems redundant after line 29.
qarrādu Marduk annī puṭur annī pušur
Line 31: GAŠAN = bēltu, “lady.” GAL = rabītu (f), “great.” d E 4 -ru 6 -u 8 is Zarpānītu, con-
sort of Marduk (see Mayer’s MS E, which spells out the goddess’s name).
bēltu rabītu Zarpānītu annī puṭur
Line 32: Šumu, “name.” Ṭābu, “sweet, good,” used with šumu means “excellent, wor-
thy.” d AG = Nabû, scribal god and son of Marduk (see page 325).
šumu ṭābu Nabû annī puṭur
Line 33: Tašmētum, consort of Nabu. The litany appeals to the first god of the panthe-
on and his spouse in lines 30–31 and then the next ranking divine pair, Nabu and Tash-
metu, in lines 32–33.
bēltu rabītu Tašmētum annī puṭur
Line 34: d U . GUR = Nergal (one MS writes Nergal’s name d GÌR . UNU . GAL ), an underworld
deity associated with plague and disaster (see page 339). He is probably used here as a
contrast to the heavenly gods invoked in the next line (Hunt, 133).
qarrādu Nergal annī puṭur
Line 35: Ašābu (wašābum), “to sit, to dwell.” d Anum is literally “(the god) Anu,” who
stands for the cosmic realm of “heaven” here. The litany broadens its view to all the celes-
tial deities.

Line 36: Ša introduces a relative clause that modifies anna rabâ. Ultu, often for ištu,
“from, out of; since, after, when.” Ūmu, “day.” Ṣeḫēru, “to be(come) small, little,” but as an
infinitive, “to be young, to be a minor” (see CAD Ṣ, 122). The pronominal suffix is the
subject of the infinitive, literally, “my being a minor.” A substantive would provide a bet-
ter idiomatic rendering. Epēšu, “to do, to make.” Here īpušu stands for ēpušu (1cs). The
final –u is the subjunctive marker, indicating that the verb only functions within the rela-
tive clause; it is not the main verb of the sentence. The entire line forms the object of the
verbs in line 37. The supplicant now treats the accumulation of all of their sins since their
youth as one large, collective sin. In so doing, it recalls line 18.
anna rabâ ša ultu ūm ṣeḫērīya īpušu
Line 37: Suppuḫu (D of sapāḫu), “scatter, disperse.” EN = adi, “up to, until, as far as.”
7 -šu = sebîšu, “seven times, sevenfold.” A seven-fold dispersal, paralleling the seven-fold
call for forgiveness in lines 29–35, indicates the desire for total forgiveness of all accumu-
lated sin. The supplicant wants a fresh start, a clean slate.
suppiḫ-ma adi sebîšu puṭur
Line 38: Alādu (walādum), “to give birth to” (female subject), “to engender, to beget”
(male subject). The pronominal suffix on the participle (here and in the next line, accord-
ing to Mayer’s MS A) is the object of the verbal action. Libbaka is the object of the sen-
tence’s main verb at the end of line 39. The parental simile here and in the next line re-
calls the use of abu in line 2.
libbaka kīma abi ālidīya
Line 39: Ālittu is a fs participle from alādu. The third root letter d, a dental, has assim-
ilated to the t of the feminine marker. Ašrīšu is ašru plus a 3ms pronominal suffix. Târu, “to
return, to turn back”; but târu with ašru means “to return to normal” (see CAD T, 255).
Marduk has been angry; his heart has been exercised. The supplicant asks that Marduk
now return to normal (i.e., relent from his anger), which the supplicant defines in terms of
the affection of human parents.
u kīma ummi ālittīya ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 40: The same invocation used in lines 1 and 30 is repeated here in the otherwise
formulaic promise of praise. Bulluṭu, “to restore to health, to revive.” Dalīlū, “praises.”
Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and
its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomatically, “let me proclaim your
praises” or the like.

Line 41: This line is the rubric, which tells something about the classification of the
preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the kind of prayer on the tablet and to
whom it is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated,
“it is the wording of a lifted-hand to Marduk.”
Line 42: KÌD . KÌD . BI = kik(k)iṭṭûšu, “its ritual.” One MS preserves a common alternative:

exists in his MS d. KÌD . KÌD . BI (or DÙ . DÙ . BI ) alerts the user of the tablet that the ritual instruc-
tions follow. Compare the ÉN at the beginning of the prayer. All of the items included in
the following are common elements of Mesopotamian ritual. IGI = pānu, “face,” or maḫru,
“front”; both are possible. Ana pāni, maḫri means “to the face of, in front of.” NÍG . NA =
nignakku, “incense burner.” ( GIŠ .) ŠIM . LI = burāšu, “juniper” (pieces of wood or its resin).
The juniper is the material to be burnt in the incense burner. GAR = šakānu, “to set up, to

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
There are many items in this prayer that we could discuss comparatively
with the Hebrew Bible, but space only permits a few suggestions. 1
Lines 2 and 38 of our prayer compare Marduk to a father (abu). 2 Several
texts in the Hebrew Bible also imagine Yahweh as a father (‫ב‬ ‫)א‬:
to Israel as a
people (e.g., Deut 32:6, Isa 63:16, 64:7, Jer 3:19, 31:9, Mal 2:10, and 3:17), to
their king (e.g., 2 Sam 7:14 and Ps 89:7, and compare Ps 2:7, in which Yahweh
says, “you are my son, today I have fathered you” [‫יָך‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ִ ְ‫י‬, cognate to Akk. alādu
in lines 38–39]), and to individuals within Israel (e.g., Prov 3:12). Although it
provides another example of Yahweh as father to the individual, Ps 103:13 is
particularly striking in its similarities to the sentiments of abu rēmēnû, “merciful
father,” in line 2 of our prayer: ‫יו‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ֵ ְ‫ל־י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ל־בּ‬
‫ע‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫כּ‬,
“as a father
shows mercy (‫ם‬ ‫ח‬ ֵ ‫ר‬, ַ D inf., cognate to Akk. rēmēnû) to (his) children, (so) Yahweh
shows mercy to those who fear him.” The comparable use of parental or fatherly
imagery for a deity in Israel and Mesopotamia should not be understood in
terms of cultural diffusion or borrowing. Rather, the use of parental imagery is
rooted in an anthropomorphizing model of deity that clarifies certain divine
attributes via analogy with a common, basic social reality: loving parents.
A rhetorical question in lines 8–9 of our prayer broaches the topic of human
ignorance of sin (see also line 18), a common motif in Mesopotian prayer. 3 Ps
19:13 contains a very similar idea in the form of a rhetorical question: ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫יאוֹת‬ ‫ג‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ְ
‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫קּ‬ ֵ ַ‫נ‬ ‫רוֹת‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ס‬ ְ ִ‫נּ‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ין‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ָ‫י‬, “Who can discern (one’s) errors? Acquit me of hidden sins” (con-
trast Ps 51:5, where the supplicant is quite aware of his failing). 4 Although the
question in this verse is almost identical to what we see in line 9 of our prayer,
the biblical petition does not have the same tone as the petitions of the Akkadi-
an prayer. Rather, in the psalm the measure for understanding the depths of
one’s failings as well as the means to achieve obedience are revealed in the Torah
(vv. 8–12). The petition in v. 13 and those in vv. 14–15, therefore, seem to be
uttered by a supplicant confident about the deity’s will and requirements; this
1
Many broad thematic studies could be suggested. For example, Marduk’s epithet qarrādu,
“warrior,” suggests a comparison with the Hebrew Bible’s depiction of Yahweh as divine warrior.
The penitential theme of the entire prayer suggests a comparison with the Penitential Psalms
(Pss 6, 32, 38, 51, 102, 130, 143), among others. And the sentiments expressed in lines 11–15 of
our prayer represent a rather pessimistic view on divine–human relations, bringing to mind for
different reasons both the primeval curse on the original humans in Gen 3 and the grim outlook
on everyday life expressed in Qoh 1:13–15. As interesting as they are, these topics are too large
and involved to consider here.
2
Contrast line 39, where Marduk is compared to a mother.
3
Line 10 changes the subject significantly, asking rhetorically if there is anyone without sin. The
question and implied answer are not so much an excuse for sin as a basis for mercy. See Ps
130:3, which asks a similar rhetorical question for the same purpose. See also, e.g., 1 Kgs 8:46,
for the idea that no one is without sin in a context dealing with supplication.
4
See also Ps 90:8 for another psalm that mentions secret sins. For a brief discussion of secret sin,
the human propensity for sin, and adolescent sins in the Hebrew Bible, see van der Toorn, Sin
and Sanction, 97–99.308stands in contrast to what line 11 in our Akkadian prayer suggests. This interpre-
tation is supported by the epithets the psalmist uses in v. 15 for the deity: ‫י‬ ‫צוּר‬
‫י‬ ִ‫ל‬ ‫ֹא‬ ֲ ‫ג‬ ְ‫ו‬, “my rock and my redeemer.” But seeing this confidence in Ps 19 is not to
suggest that such an attitude was pervasive throughout all of Israel at all times.
In fact, the stress and anxiety one reads in the biblical laments of the individual
suggest that supplicants often were uncertain about the reasons for their prob-
lems—much like our Akkadian-speaking supplicant.
The phrase itâ etēqu, used in line 17, literally means “to cross a boundary”
but may also have a more ethically-charged meaning in some contexts, “to
transgress.” A similar semantic range exists in the use of the BH root ‫עבר‬. For
example, in Job 14:6 ‫עבר‬ with ‫חֹק‬ as its object means “to cross a boundary or
limit”: ‫בוֹר‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ַ‫י‬ ‫לֹא‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ית‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫יו‬ ‫קּ‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ֻ , “you have made his limits that he cannot cross.” But
other objects may be used with the verb to bring out the ethical idea more ex-
plicitly and to identify what one has transgressed (as is sometimes the case with
Akkadian etēqu, see CAD E, 389). Thus, for example, one may illicitly cross or
transgress a commandment (‫ה‬ ָ‫ו‬ ‫צ‬ ְ ‫מ‬,
e.g., Deut 26:13, 2 Chron 24:20, and Esth 3:3
[of a human king]), a covenant (‫ית‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫בּ‬,
e.g., Deut 17:2, Judg 2:20, Josh 7: 11, 15,
23:16, and Jer 34:18), divine instruction(s) ( ‫ה‬ ‫תּוֹר‬
/ ‫ֹת‬ ‫תּוֹר‬ , e.g., Dan 9:11, Isa
24:5), or the word of Yahweh (‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫פּ‬,
e.g., Num 14:41, 22:18, 1 Sam 15:24, Prov
8:29 [‫יו‬ ‫)]פ‬.
Given the fact that Israel is often addressed in the Bible as a group, it
should be no surprise that many of the biblical references talk about collective
transgression (but see Esth 3:3).

A Shuilla: Marduk 2
K YLE G REENWOOD
M ARDUK :
See page 291.
T HE P RAYER : 1
Like other shuilla-prayers, this prayer to Marduk consists of an introductory
hymn (lines 1–9), a petition (lines 12–20 [13–21]), and a benediction (lines 21–
25 [25–27]). 2 The prayer concludes with a ritual formula. Abusch has outlined
the structure of the entire prayer as follows:
I. Introductory Hymn (1–9)
A. Capsule Shuilla (10–11) [10–12]
II. Prayer for Success (12–20) [13–21]
Aʹ. Capsule Shuilla (21–22) [22–24]
III. Concluding Benediction (23–25) [25–27]
Unlike other shuilla-prayers, this prayer has two summary statements, one im-
mediately preceding the petition and one immediately following the petition.
If the prayer were indeed chiastic in structure, one would expect the central
literary unit to display some of the characteristics of the entire unit. In fact, this
is very much the case. One can readily appreciate the prayer’s grammatical so-
phistication.

Not only is there balance in the verbal forms, but there is concentric movement
in the person of the verbal forms: 1–2–3–3–3–3–2–1. 3 Furthermore, this balance
is evident in the themes: success  acceptance; mouth, mind  speak, hear, obey;
courtier and attendant  protective god; god  goddess. Within the framework of
the petition, the supplicant requests success and protection, which come hand-
in-hand. In order to receive protection from his personal deities, the supplicant
must be successful in his moral and religious obligations.
Two summary statements (lines 10–11 [10–12], 21–22 [22–24]) flank the
petition section. The inclusion of the summary statements is a deviation from the
standard shuilla-prayer structure. However, they serve two important literary
functions. First, as Abusch notes, these summaries or “capsules” consist of two
parallel sections with shared vocabulary and forms.
Invocation:
Marduk bēlu rabû (ilu rēmēnû)  Marduk bēlu rabû
Prayer for Life:
ina qibītīka kitti lubluṭ lušlim-ma  napištī qīša balāṭ napištīya qibi
Promise of Service:
luštammar ilūtka  maḫarka namriš atalluka lušbi
In each case, the capsule both introduces and is distinct from the prayer section
that immediately follows. Moreover, each capsule is constructed along the norms
of a regular shuilla-prayer: hymn (invocation), petition, benediction. Second,
since they are parallel with each other, these capsules broaden the chiastic struc-
ture displayed in the petition section.
At the outermost edges of the chiasm are the introductory hymn and bene-
diction. The hymnic introduction, lines 1–9, consists of three stanzas of three
lines each. According to Abusch, “the first stanza emphasized city and temple;
the second, temple and human life; the third stanza serves both to broaden Mar-
duk’s focus of concern and action as well as to bring together again locality,
temple, and human community—but this time on a higher level of generaliza-
tion” (8). This introduction functions to convey Marduk’s expansion from local
deity and divine offspring to universal and supreme god. The benediction recalls
the main theme addressed in the introductory hymn. Marduk is a universal deity
with historical connections to the great gods of Eridu.
The overall effect of the structure is to create a literary version of a presen-
tation scene, a glyptic motif commonly seen on Mesopotamian cylinder seals.
The supplicant prepares to meet Marduk in the center of the petition section. He
then meets Marduk in the two capsules, at which point he would present his

315
offerings. Finally, in the outer bands of the prayer, he praises the deity as one
worthy of his offerings.
As is the case with other incantation-prayers in this volume, this shuilla
was utilized in lustration rituals. The king would recite this and other incanta-
tions as part of the royal ceremonies of Bīt mēseri, “House of Detention,” and Bīt
rimki, “House of Ablution,” in the hope of counteracting the evil effects wrought
by impurity, thereby restoring his health.
The textual tradition for Marduk 2 is extensive. 4 The benefits of such a
broad corpus are invaluable. Of course, this leads to certain inconsistencies
among the MSS . In addition to the expected textual variants, some MSS lack the
formulaic conclusion. Furthermore, there are some discrepancies in line number-
ing. For the purposes of this volume and due to the fact that an up-to-date edi-
tion that utilizes all of the MSS is lacking, this treatment follows Ebeling’s edition,
which is based on KAR 59. Other MSS will be used only selectively to fill its gaps
or to provide better readings.

epithet for the god better known as Enki in Sumerian and Ea in Akkadian (see page 227).
In the Eridu Genesis (also known as the Ziusudra Epic), Nudimmud was appointed as the
patron deity of Eridu. The phrase bukur Nudimmud recalls the mythologies in which Mar-
duk is identified as the son of Nudimmud. Thus, lines 1–2 invoke the memory of Marduk’s
historical significance in the Babylonian pantheon.
rubû tizqāru bukur Nudimmud
Line 3: d AMAR . UTU , “bull-calf of the sun/storm,” is one of several designations for
Marduk (see page 291). The adjective šalbābu, “wise” is a common epithet for Marduk.
Ruššu (D of râšu), “to give cause for rejoicing, celebration.” This participle presumably
refers to the anonymous worshippers of Marduk at É-engur-ra. This temple, whose Sumeri-
an name means “House of the Sweet Waters,” is not attested elsewhere as a temple of
Marduk. However, it is known to be the name for temples of Inana and Nanshe, as well as
a dais for Ea at E-sagil (see A. R. George, House Most High: The Temples of Ancient Mesopo-
tamia [Mesopotamian Civilizations 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993], #248). The five
participles in lines 3–7 are used substantively as epithets of the deity.
Marduk šalbābu murīš E-engura
Line 4: EN = bēlu, “lord.” É-sag-íl, “House Whose Top is High,” was the Sumerian
name of Marduk’s temple in Babylon (George, House Most High, #967). Tukultu, “trust,
object of trust, support.” KÁ . DINGIR . RA ki = Bābili, “Babylon.” There are other orthographies
attested for the name of Babylon in the various MSS , e.g., E ki and báb-ì-lí.
bēl E-sagil tukulti Bābili
Line 5: Râmu, “to love.” É-zi-da, which means “True House” in Sumerian, was known
primarily as a temple for Nabu, but Marduk was venerated periodically at a temple by this
name in Borsippa (George, House Most High, #1236). Šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to preserve,
to keep well.” Napištu and balāṭu (see line 6) are parallel terms meaning “life.” Taking line
21 into consideration, balāṭu has been translated as “health” in an effort to remain faithful
to the Akkadian nuances.
rāʾim E-zida mušallim napišti
Line 6: Ašarēdu (ašaridu), “foremost, prominent.” TI . LA = balāṭu, “life, health.” The
phrase mudeššû balāṭi does not translate smoothly. The D stem participle of dešû, “to be or𒌋𒐌 A S HUILLA : M ARDUK 2

the English verb “invigorate” provides a close approximation to the original intent. É-maḫ-
ti-la was the Sumerian name of Marduk’s throne in E-sagil (George, House Most High,
#735). Most MSS preserve a Sumerian word play in lines 5–6 between the name of the
temple in the first stichos and Marduk’s relationship to humanity in the second. Thus, é-zi-

Line 7: Ṣulūlu, “roof, protection.” Gamālu, “to do a favor, to be kind to, to spare, to
save.” UN = nišū, “people.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “broad, expansive, wide.” Nišī
rapšāti literally means, “an extensive people,” connoting that the people are vast in num-
ber and widespread in geography. Nišū is a feminine noun, hence the feminine ending on
the adjective.
ṣulūl māti gāmil nišī rapšāti
Line 8: UŠUMGAL (= ušumgallu) is composed of the two signs GAL-UŠUM. Its primary
definition is “great dragon,” or “great serpent.” This word was a royal and divine epithet,
meaning “omnipotent, sovereign.” Kališ, “all, everywhere.” BARAG is a Sumerian word that
comes into Akkadian as parakku, meaning “dais, sanctuary, chapel.”
ušumgal kališ parakkī
Line 9: In the ancient world šumu, “name,” entailed the identity of the one possessing
the name. The ability to speak the deity’s name gave the supplicant an element of control
over that deity. The supplicant is confessing to Marduk that those who know the deity’s
name are properly handling that name. Ina pī literally means “in the mouth of,” but the
idiom works best in English as “on the lips of.” Ṭâbu, “to be(come) good, sweet, favora-
ble.” The form here is a G 3ms predicative.
šumka kališ ina pī nišī ṭāb
Line 10: Rēmēnû, “merciful.” Capsule A of lines 10–11, with its renewed invocation
(see line 3), forms a transition between the opening hymn and the petition section of the
prayer.
Marduk bēlu rabû ilu rēmēnû
Line 11: Line 11 contains three consecutive 1cs precatives, as indicated by the lu–
preformative, rather than li– (see also the end of line 12). Kīnu (m), kittu (f), “true, just,
correct, steadfast.” MSS vary with regard to this adj. Variants include kabitti, “heavy, se-
vere, weighty,” and ṣīrti, “exalted, supreme, august.” Luštammar is in the Gt stem, from
šamāru, “to extol, praise.” Note the abstract ending (–ūt) on ilu, rendering the noun as31812. e-ma ú-ṣa-am-ma-ru lu-uk-šu-ud

“divinity” or “god-ness.” Recall that clauses joined by –ma are logically connected. Since
lušlim-ma is followed by another injunctive form, we should understand luštammar ilūtka as
a resultative clause.

Line 12: The particle ēma, “whatever,” introduces a dependent clause, which is con-
cluded by uṣammaru, a 1cs durative of ṣummuru (D of ṣamāru), “to strive for, to aim, to
plan.” The –u suffix is the subjunctive marker. Kašādu, “to reach, to achieve.” In military
contexts, the verb implies victory; that is, the army reaches its goal.
ēma uṣammaru lukšud
Line 13: Šakānu, “to put, to place, to establish.” Kittu, “truth, justice, steadfastness,” is
a noun and should be distinguished semantically from the homonym, a fem. adj., in line
12. “Place truth” is a common way of speaking about one’s desire for a god to establish the
right thing in a particular situation. Here the supplicant wants Marduk to give the right
words to say so they can find the social success that they presently lack. Having received
this truth, the supplicant may be better positioned for successful intercession.
šuškin kitti ina pīya
Line 14: Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to cause to be, to create.” INIM = amātu (awātum), “word,
matter.” SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f), “good, favorable.” Note the parallel structure of
lines 13 and 14: imperative, noun, prepositional phrase.
šubši amāta damiqti ina libbīya
Line 15: Tīru and nanzāzu are interchangeable terms referring to people of social
prominence, “courtier, attendant.” Qabû, “to speak, to utter, to pronounce, to report.”
Damiqtu, “favor, goodwill, goodness,” is a noun and should be distinguished from the
homonym, a fem. adj., in line 14. Damiqta qabû literally means “to speak good will, favor,”
but may be translated idiomatically as “to intercede” (see CAD D, 64). The supplicant’s
desire is that the divinely placed “good word” will be received by the social elites, who
will then intercede on his behalf.
tīru u nanzāzu liqbû damiqtī
Line 16: MU is a logogram for the 1cs pronominal suffix. One should read it as –ī in
lines 16 and 17 since the nouns are in the nominative case. By contrast, note the –ya suffix
on imnu, “right,” and šumēlu, “left” (see line 17), both of which are in the genitive case.
Izuzzu/uzuzzu, “to stand.” For a detailed study of this verb, see J. Huehnergard, “Izuzzum
and Itūlum,” in Riches Hidden in Secret Places: Ancient Near Eastern Studies in Memory of

17 introduce a significant feature of ancient Near Eastern religion. The common person did
not have access to the great royal temples. Thus, individuals sought a personal god or
goddess. The term “to acquire a god” (Akk. ila rašû; Sum. lú-dingir tuk) is synonymous
with what we would call luck or fortune (CAD I/J, 101). Since misfortune, such as illness
or disease, was thought to have derived from demons, the personal deities, standing on the
right and left, may have served an apotropaic function, thus ensuring good luck. For more
on the personal deities, see page 431.
ilī lizziz ina imnīya
Line 17: The divine number for Ishtar is 15. In this case, 15 = ištaru, used generically
to refer to the supplicant’s personal goddess. GÙB = šumēlu, “left side.”
ištarī lizziz ina šumēlīya
Line 18: Šullumu (D of šalāmu), see line 5. The participle mušallimu functions as an at-
tributive adjective modifying ilu. Kayyān, “constantly, regularly.” Lū, “let (it) be.” Á = idu,
“arm, side, strength.”
ilu mušallimu ina idīya lū kayyān
Line 19: Šurkam-ma is a G impv. from the root šarāku, “to grant” with ventive (–am)
and enclitic –ma. The impv. precedes three infinitives in the accusative case serving as
direct objects of the finite verb. Šemû, “to hear.” Magāru, “to follow an order, to obey” (see
CAD M/I, 34). There is some discrepancy in the exemplars on the final sign of the line.
KAR 59 reads RI, while other MSS read RU or RA. Following King and Meier, the accusative
reading has been adopted here.
šurkam-ma qabâ šemâ u magāra
Line 20: Aqabbû is a 1 cs G present with the subjunctive –u. GIM = kīma, “as, like.”
Because amāt is in the bound form, its syntactical function is to introduce the dependent
clause. The 3fs form of the predicative, magrat, is used for agreement with its subject, the
feminine noun amātu.
amāt aqabbû kīma aqabbû lū magrat
Line 21: Qīša (qâšu, “to give, to bestow”) and qibi are both ms imperatives. When re-
ferring to the gods, qabû often has the meaning, “to give an order, decree.” TI . LA = balāṭu,
see line 6. Balāṭ napištīya, lit. “good health of my life,” is an objective genitive construc-
tion. That is, balāṭu is not equivalent to napištī, but is manifest in it. Lines 21–22, comprise
the prayer’s third invocation, capsule Aʹ.

Line 22: Namriš, “brilliantly, splendidly.” Note the terminative-adverbial ending (–iš),
indicating the manner in which the action of the verb is to be enacted. As a manner of
walking, namriš has the sense of “radiantly” as in “a bright mood” (CAD N/I, 239). Maḫru
(= IGI ), “front, presence.” Atalluka is a Gtn stem infinitive of alāku in the accusative case,
meaning “to walk about, to roam about.” It is the object of the precative lušbi (šebû, “to be
satisfied, to be full”). For more on the Akkadian use of maḫar atalluku, see M. Weinfeld,
“The Covenant of Grant in the Old Testament and in the Ancient Near East,” JAOS 90
(1970), 185–88. Lines 22–25 utilize a series of precatives to communicate the essence of
the prayer.
maḫarka namriš atalluka lušbi
Line 23: The two precatives from hadû and râšu, both meaning “to rejoice (in/over),”
are synonyms in parallel construction. Enlil (Akk. Ellil) is one of the most significant dei-
ties in Mesopotamia. In Sumerian mythology, he was known as ab-ba-dingir-re-ne, “father
of the gods.” His consort was Ninlil and together they bore many important deities, such as
Adad, Nanna-Suen, Nergal, Nusku, and Shamash. Given the long, rich history of the an-
cient Near East, it is understandable that traditions regarding its many deities were not
uniform. In some texts, Enlil was considered a descendent of Anu. Elsewhere, he was
deemed a son of Ea. In either case, both Enlil and Ea are extremely important deities in the
Babylonian pantheon. That they might rejoice over Marduk would be considered the high-
est of complements to the deity.
Ellil liḫdūka Ea lirīška
Line 24: The reading kiššatum in KAR 59 is less desirable, since mimation is not at-
tested elsewhere in the text and because one would expect the genitive case ending. There-
fore, the present text follows BMS 9 and KAR 23. Kiššatu is a political, rather than cosmo-
logical term. It refers to the dominion of kings and deities in the inhabited world. Karābu,
“to greet (with a blessing), to beseech,” is the root of a common Akkadian word for prayer,
ikribu.
ilū ša kiššati likrubūka
Line 25: Ilū rabûtu may refer to Enlil and Ea, since they are the nearest antecedents.
However, this phrase generally refers to the divine council. The great gods seem to serve
both a generic and a specific purpose, particularly in royal inscriptions. There the divine
council may represent the entire pantheon available to the king, or it may refer to those
specific deities relevant to the king for accomplishing a specific purpose. These purposes
may include military aid or the protection of sacred structures (see Kyle R. Greenwood,
“The Hearing Gods of the Assyrian Royal Inscriptions,” JANER 10 (2010), 211–18). Liṭibbū
is a 3mp precative from ṭubbu (D of ṭâbu), “to do something well, to satisfy.”

Line 26: This line is the prayer’s rubric, which tells about the text’s classification. In
this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it is directed. As is typi-
cal, the rubric is written in Sumerian.
Line 27: DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” KEŠDA = riksu, lit. means “knot, binding,”
but in ritual contexts it carries the connotation of arranging the show table with food and
drink, that is, offerings, for the deity. The word is generally translated as “ritual arrange-
ment” (CAD R, 351–52). NÍG . NA = nignakku, “incense burner.” DÙ = epēšu, “to do, to
make.” Šumma . . . šumma is a syntactical construction indicating “either . . . or.” In its
present context, it signifies two options for performing the ritual. This line is a variation of
an abbreviated ritual instruction commonly found in shuillas. It probably serves as the
catchphrase to a fuller ritual, which the exorcist would recall and perform from memory
(see Mayer, UFBG, 119, n.3).

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Many comparisons could be made between the epithets of Marduk and
those of Yahweh. Most are easily recognizable, such as prince (Isa 9:6), protec-
tion (Ps 41:2; 121:7; 146:9), salvation (Gen 49:18; Ps 3:8; Mic 7:7), support (2
Sam 22:19  Ps 18:18; 2 Chr 16:9), and wise (Job 9:4; 28:12–23; Prov 2:6).
However, the epithet tukulti Bābili has an interesting parallel with BH, ‫יּוֹן‬ ‫צ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬,
“stronghold of Zion.” Tukultu and ‫ה‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬ ְ are not semantic equivalents, but they
connote similar concepts. The former literally means, “support, trust, reliance,”
while the latter means, “stronghold” or “fortress.” According to biblical tradi-
tion, ‫יּוֹן‬ ִ‫צ‬ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬ ְ was the original name for Jerusalem (2 Sam 5:7  1 Chr 11:5) pri-
or to its conquest by David. Upon the completion of the temple, Jerusalem be-
came the locus of Israel’s deity. Thus, Zion was recognized as the holy mountain
(Joel 4:17), Yahweh’s throne (Ps 9:12) and dwelling place (Ps 76:3), the place
where Yahweh’s name dwelled (Isa 18:7) and whence his name shined forth (Ps
50:2). Although the actual phrase ‫יּוֹן‬ ‫צ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫צ‬ ֻ ‫מ‬ ְ only occurs in the two aforemen-
tioned verses, the notion that Yahweh was the source of Zion’s strength and sup-
port occurs elsewhere. In Ps 31:3, the psalmist cries out to Yahweh that the deity
would be ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫יע‬
‫ֺשׁ‬ ִ ‫הו‬ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ֺת‬ ‫צוּדו‬ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫ית‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ “as a fortress to save me.” The same idea is present
elsewhere in the Hebrew Bible, as well (e.g., Ps 9:9; 18:2; Jer 16:19; Joel 4:16;
Nah 1:7). In the same way, Marduk is the source of support and trust for the city
of Babylon and for all who worshipped him.
The idea of the personal god is not foreign to the biblical authors, although
evidence of a personal goddess is not forthright. This is not to say that Yahweh
or Elohim were only considered personal gods. Such an assertion could not be
substantiated. However, there are instances where the theology of the personal
god was, at the very least, in the background. Certainly, the ancestral narratives322were cognizant of the idea. In the Old Akkadian period, one way of referring to
the personal god was il abi, “the god of the father,” or “ancestral deity.” This
should immediately call to mind the biblical phrase ‫י‬ ‫ב‬ ִ ‫א‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ , “the god of my
father,” or more specifically ‫קֹב‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫י‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ק‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫צ‬ ְ ִ‫י‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫א‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ , “the god of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob” (e.g. Exod 3:16). In fact, Jacob had some uncertainty whether or not
he would claim Yahweh as his own personal god, placing stipulations on his
commitment. If Jacob would return safely on his quest for a wife, ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬
‫ים‬ ‫אֹלה‬
‫ל‬,
“then Yahweh will become my deity” (Gen 28:21). Another example
from the Pentateuch is found in the account of Rachel and Laban. As Rachel
leaves her father’s home, she absconds his ‫ים‬ ‫פ‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫תּ‬ ְ (Gen 31:19). While there is
some degree of uncertainty over the precise meaning of this term, the underly-
ing idea inherent in most suggestions is that it refers to the personal or house-
hold god. 1 If its etymology is rooted in ‫רפא‬, “to heal,” 2 then the term fits well
with the ancients’ expectations of a personal god. Finally, Ps 22 may need to be
considered in light of the belief in the personal god: ‫חוֹק‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ב‬ ְ ַ‫ז‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫ה‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫י‬ ִ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ
‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ָ‫ג‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫שׁ‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫ב‬ ְ ‫דּ‬ ִ ‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫ישׁוּע‬
‫מ‬,
“My god, my god, why have you abandoned me? Why are my
groans so far from my deliverance?” The supplicant cries out to their deity, in
this case Yahweh, as one who is under attack from disease, i.e., evil spirits, and
is in desperate need of protection from this affliction.
Additionally, we find in the phrase maḫarka namriš atalluka (line 22) several
interesting parallels. First, namriš derives from nawāru (> namāru). In Biblical
Hebrew this root appears in noun form as ‫ר‬ ֵ‫נ‬ (from ‫)נור‬, “lamp.” The u-class me-
dial vowel has been retained in the derivative noun ‫ה‬ ‫ֺר‬ ָ ‫נו‬ ‫מ‬,
“lampstand.” Second,
the Gtn infinitive atalluku corresponds directly to the Hebrew hitpael (Gtn)
‫ך‬ ‫לּ‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬.
Furthermore, maḫarka atalluku is analogous to ‫י‬ ַ‫נ‬ ‫פ‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ך‬ ‫לּ‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ (Gen 17:1). The
reflexive form of the verbs indicates repetitive, habitual action. Examples of this
phrase are attested in Gen 24:40 and 48:15. Third, several of the psalms express
the idea communicated in the phrase. Psalm 16:11 says, “You inform me of the
way of life. Your presence is the fullness of joy. Good fortune is in your right
hand forever.” Even more striking is Ps 43, a psalm of lament with a similar
theme as Capsule Aʹ of our prayer. Verse 4 reads, “Then I will go to the altar of
God; to God, the source of my joy. I will praise you on the lyre, O God, my god.”
In both of these examples the psalmists articulate the same sentiment as the
supplicant in our prayer to Marduk. That is, living in the presence of the deity
brings immeasurable joy to the life of the worshiper.

A Shuilla: Nabu 1
A LAN L ENZI
N ABU :
A Babylonian scribal god hailing from Borsippa, Nabu was the son of Mar-
duk and a major god in the post-OB Mesopotamian pantheon. His consort was
Tashmetu. Although attested already in the early second millennium, we can
trace Nabu’s rise to prominence only starting in the later second millennium. His
status in the pantheon reached its zenith during the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-
Babylonian periods, as attested by the several temples and shrines dedicated to
him in many major Assyrian and Babylonian cities (e.g., Nineveh, Nimrud,
Borsippa, and Babylon). Personal names are further proof of his importance.
Nabu was the most common deity invoked in Neo-Assyrian theophoric names
and second only to Marduk in first millennium Babylonia. Note especially the
Neo-Babylonian royal names Nebuchadnezzar (Nabû-kudurrī-uṣur, “O Nabu,
guard my firstborn”) and Nabonidus (Nabû-naʾid, “Nabu is praised”).
Archaeologists have uncovered tablets in several of Nabu’s É-zi-da temples
(“The True House”). The Nimrud finds are especially impressive, which have
yielded copies of the Succession Treaty of Esarhaddon (see SAA 2, no. 6) in a
throne room and about three hundred tablets of literary content in the temple’s
library (see CTN IV). 1 Tablets found in libraries at Ashur, Nineveh, and Huzirina
(modern Sultan Tepe) bear formulaic colophons that clearly demonstrate scribal
devotion to Nabu (e.g., Hunger, BAK, nos. 233, 318, and 353, the latter of which
reads tākilka ul ibâš Nabû, “the one who trusts in you, O Nabu, will not be put to
shame”).
In keeping with his function as the scribe of the gods, Nabu was represented
by a stylus or wedge in iconography. Celestially, he is associated with the planet
Mercury. He is mentioned by name in the Bible in Isa 46:1.

Imperial City Revealed (London: British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2001), 203–10.
325326T HE P RAYER :
The prayer adapts the typical three-part structure of shuillas. It starts with
the customary hymnic introduction in lines 1–11. Line 12 contains the usual self-
identification formula and recognition of the supplicant’s humble position in
relation to the deity (“the servant who fears you”). Lines 13–20 comprise the
prayer’s petition section, thematically-centered on the supplicant’s old age. A
description of piety (lines 13–14) precedes the complaint (lines 15–18). A reca-
pitulation of the invocation follows in line 19 (compare with line 1) just before
the prayer’s very brief petition proper in line 20. The prayer concludes with a
one line formulaic promise of future praise (line 21).
Joel Hunt has recognized a tri-partite structure to the opening hymn based
on grammatical and thematic features. In lines 1–5 substantives and participial
phrases that describe Nabu’s character predominate. These lines present a time-
less portrait of Nabu’s attributes. In Lines 6–8 complete sentences using third
person verbs describe Nabu’s word, his relationship to his father, Marduk, and
thus his position within the hierarchy of the gods. Finally, lines 9–10, using
complete sentences and second person verbs (if one follows Mayer’s MS B in line
9), characterize Nabu as one willing and able to help a supplicant with angry
personal deities. The use of second person verbs in this final part of the hymn
begins a transition between the hymnic introduction and the petition section.
Although its structure is fairly typical, the prayer offers a couple of points of
literary interest. I have already mentioned how line 19 near the end of the pray-
er, positioned between lament and petition, re-invokes the deity with words that
recall the first line. Notice also that the use of the words “days” and “years” in
line 17, part of the lament, recalls the vocabulary of line 3, part of the hymnic
introduction. The employment of the verb ṣabātu, “to seize, hold,” in line 20
harks back to the same verb in line 2, if the restoration is correct: Nabu holds his
stylus; the supplicant seizes Nabu’s prayer. Finally, just as Nabu is the one who
opens the ear (line 2) to receive divine insight, the supplicant is the one who
opens their hands (line 14) in prayer (for a possible pun, see the notes on line
14). It seems the prayer re-uses the vocabulary of the first few lines throughout
the remainder of the prayer, but especially toward its conclusion, thereby giving
the prayer a certain coherence with regard to language.
The prayer presents the supplicant as an elderly person (lines 14 and 17),
perhaps one who has lived a life of devotion (line 13). Despite their humility
before the gods and humans (?, lines 15–16), they feel they have not received
the favor and mercy due them (line 18). The precise nature and origin of the
mistreatment—whether from the gods or humans or both—are not entirely
clear. But one might infer from lines 9–10 that the anger of the supplicant’s per-
sonal gods is involved. One might also consider, in light of the supplicant’s years
having come to an end (line 17), that the supplicant worries about their impend-
ing death. In any case, the supplicant wishes to be set free from that which is
troubling them (line 20). There is little more that can be said without indulging
in speculation.𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

Two of the three MSS used in Mayer’s edition (A and B) preserve ritual in-
structions, though Mayer himself did not include them in his edition (see
Ebeling, AGH, 12, who provides several conjectural restorations). Unfortunately,
both tablets are broken or abraded in the same area of the ritual instructions,
leaving us with an incomplete picture of the actions prescribed. What does seem
relatively clear is the setting up of censors and having the supplicant repeat
some of the words of the prayer. The final act is a prostration, a fitting gesture of
subordination as one leaves the presence of a superior.
One final comment: The colophons of MSS A and B indicate that the tablets
were copied by young scribes (šamallû ṣeḫru), perhaps wishing to make a good
impression on their patron deity (see Hunger, BAK, nos. 235 and 395). 2

Mayer’s MS A (KAR 25 +) contains the following shuillas: Nabu 1, Marduk 2, 18, 19, Nabu 2,
Sin 9, and Enlil 1b, in that order, followed by a fourteen-line colophon, in which a very proud
young scribe traces his genealogy back several generations. MS B (STT 55) contains Marduk 2
and Nabu 1, followed by a fragmentary, one line colophon.

[ ÉN d A ] G ? reš-tu-ú IBILA ke-e-nu
Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation.” This word marks the beginning of the prayer. It is
not a part of the prayer itself. d AG = Nabû. There is no question that this prayer is directed
to Nabu (see lines 7, 19, and 22). There is, however, some question as to whether the text
actually indicates this by stating the deity’s name at its beginning (the sign read as AG
here is partly broken). Rēštû, “firstborn, preeminent.” One’s semantic decision should be
based on the whole line, especially the meaning of IBILA . For confirmation, see the usage in
CAD R, 275, which cites this lexeme in other contexts alongside māru and aplu. IBILA =
aplu, “heir, son.” Kēnu (kīnu), “true.” Here, the word denotes legitimacy, as in the “true
heir.”

Line 2: Ṣabātu, “to seize, to hold.” GI = qanû, “reed” (qan = bound form). Ṭuppu,
“tablet.” One should translate the words “the reed of the tablet” in light of the material
culture of the Mesopotamian scribe. With what did scribes write? Note the sound play
between kēnu and qan in lines 1 and 2, respectively. Is this significant? Note also the use of
kittu, the feminine form of kēnu, in the following phrase said of Nabu: ṣābit-ma qan ṭuppu
kittu, “(Nabu), who holds the proper stylus” (cited in CAD K, 393). BAD = pītu, “opening”
(lit.); or BAD = petû, “to open.” Ḫasissu is usually written ḫasīsu (see CDA, 109, CAD Ḫ,
126, and the variant in Mayer’s MS C: ḫa-si-[si]), “aperture of the ear, understanding.” BAD
may be understood as either the noun pītu or a participle, pētû, “the one who opens.” The
former interpretation yields pīt ḫasissi, literally, “opening of the ear,” which denotes ex-
traordinary intelligence (CAD P, 446). Here the phrase would imply that extraordinary
intelligence is an attribute of the deity and is related to or possibly a result of Nabu’s
scribal ability. But what is one to do with the phonetic complement –u? The latter inter-
pretation ( BAD = pētû) maintains the grammatical parallel with lines 3 and 4 (and the
restoration in line 2) and implies that Nabu, as the paradigmatic scribe, imparts knowledge
to human scribes. The implication of the phrase is revelatory, as Ludlul bēl nēmeqi II 8,
using the near synonym uznu, demonstrates: zaqīqu abāl-ma ul upatti uznī, “I prayed to the
dream god, but he did not open my ear.” As for the phonetic complement on BAD , in SB
Akkadian a participle from a III-weak root in construct with a following substantive often
ends with –û (see Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der jungbaby-
lonischen „hymnischen“ Literatur, 2 Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 14/1–2;
Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987], 1.95).
ṣābit qan ṭuppi pētû ḫasissi
Line 3: UD . MEŠ = ūmū (f. ūmātu), plural(s) of ūmu, “day.” Barû, “to watch over, to
inspect, to observe”; also used technically by scribes in tablet colophons, “to collate.” The
latter usage is not appropriate here, but may provide background information for inter-
preting Nabu’s epithet here in line 3b. MU .( AN . NA .) MEŠ = šanātu, plural of šattu, “year” (see
line 17 also).

Line 4: Eṭēru, “to spare (someone).” Possibly read [na-ṣir], from naṣāru, “to protect, to
guard.” Napištu, “life.” Turru (D of târu) gimilla, “to return a kindness, to avenge.” The
social and literary context in which this phrase is used determines the kind of return one
will receive, good or bad (see CAD G, 74–75 for examples). Given the positive epithet in
line 4a, the returning of a kindness may seem most appropriate. But, one may also enter-
tain the idea that line 4a is directed at the speaker of the prayer while 4b against those
who would threaten the speaker’s life. In this case, avenging may be the best interpreta-
tion. Given the possibilities, one may wish to choose a translation that conveys both posi-𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

tive and negative connotations of the phrase. For example, Nabu is “one who responds to
actions in kind.”
ēṭir napišti mutēr gimilli
Line 5: SAG . KAL = ašarēdu (ašaridu), “leader, foremost.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.”
Ašarēd ilī is a very common title for various deities in prayers (see CAD A/2, 417). Šumu,
“name.” Kabtu (= DUGUD ), “heavy, weighty, important.” See line 28.
ašarēd ilī šumu kabtu
Line 6: Zikru, “speech, command, name.” The pronominal suffix on zikru refers to
Nabu, who is the center of attention here. Enû, “to change.” The subject for this verb is in
the second part of the line. Bānû, “progenitor, creator.” This term is commonly found in
apposition with abu, “father.” See CAD B, 94.
zikiršu ul enni abu bānûšu
Line 7: d TU . TU = Marduk. DUMU = māru, “son.” Notice the grammatical and semantic
parallel constructions in lines 6 and 7. The verb, ul enni, and the kinship terms, bānû and
māru, occupy the same place in each line, but there is a chiastic pattern in the positions of
zikiršu / zikir Nabû and abu / d TU . TU .
Marduk ul enni zikir Nabû mārīšu
Line 8: Māšu, “twin brother,” is the third kinship term in the last few lines. Mayer’s
B has maš-še-šu (normalized maššêšu). Maššû is a by-form of māšu (see CAD M/1, 401).
How might one understand the idea of the gods as Nabu’s twin brothers? Perhaps he
is/was their equal or peer. Amātu (awātum), “word.” Ṣīru, “august, supreme, exalted,” is a
very common adjective used with divinity (see CAD Ṣ, 210–12). Here the adjective is pre-
dicative (3fs). The exaltation of Nabu’s word in the latter part of the line may indicate his
position of authority over those gods once his peers.
ina ilī māšīšu amāssu ṣīrat
MS
Line 9: Notice the change of person here and in line 10. The prayer now directly ad-
dresses Nabu with second person verbs. Lines 9 and 10 are characterized by strong gram-
matical and semantic parallelism: both begin with relative clauses describing a person
experiencing divine anger (god and goddess, alternately) and then contain a second person
verb plus complement (substantive or prepositional phrase, both ending in –šu). Sabāsu
(more commonly šabāsu), “to be angry.” Suḫḫuru (D of saḫāru), “to turn (away, toward).”
The above text follows Mayer’s MS B, which shows a second person durative verb
(tusaḫḫar); this reading enhances the parallelism between lines 9 and 10. ( MS A has a third330 R EADING A KKADIAN P RAYERS AND H YMNS : A N I NTRODUCTION

person preterite, usaḫḫira.) GÚ = kišādu, “neck.” The š of the 3ms pronominal suffix (–šu)
and the final dental consonant (d) of the noun change to –ss– (–dš– becomes –ss–). To
whom does the pronominal suffix on this word refer? Nabu is the implied subject of
tusaḫḫar. The idiom suḫḫuru kišāda (or pānī), “to turn the neck (or face),” indicates the
direction of the neck’s owner’s attention, away, toward, or back to someone or something,
depending on context. See CAD S, 49–50. In this case, Nabu turns the angry personal god
back to his devotee. While the deity’s attention is directed away from his or her ward, the
individual is open to all kinds of potential evils. Thus it is important for the deity’s face (or
neck) to be turned at all times toward the devotee. For a discussion of the personal god,
see page 431.
ša ilšu isbusu tusaḫḫar kišāssu
Line 10: Zenû, “to be angry.” Zenât is a 3fs predicative form. NAM = šīmtu, “fate.”
Here, however, the term probably refers to an individual’s personal goddess (ištaru), thus
completing the parallelism started in line 9 of the angered personal god. An angry personal
god and goddess is a common motif in Mesopotamian prayers. Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to
reconcile.” Itti, “with.”
ša zenât šīmtašu tusallim ittīšu
Line 11: Mayer’s MS B adds a self-identification formula here in two lines after our
line 10. They are inserted here for sake of interest. Line 11 continues the grammatical and
semantic parallelism of lines 9–10. Arnu, “guilt.” The n of the bound form (aran–) assimi-
lates to the š of the pronominal suffix. Išû, “to have, to own.” Paṭāru, “to release.”
ša arna išû tapaṭṭar araššu
Line 12: NENNI A NENNI = annanna mār annanna, “so-and-so, son of so-and-so.” This is
a very common phrase in prayers. It serves as a placeholder for the name and filiation of
the person speaking the prayer (as in the phrase, “I, state your name”). Annanna sometimes
also holds the place for the names of a person’s personal god and goddess. ÌR = (w)ardu,
“servant.” The god–devotee relationship is imagined in terms of a king and his servant.
Palāḫu, “to fear.” The presence of this line, a self-presentation formula, at this point in the
prayer clearly signals a transition from hymn to petition.
anāku annanna mār annanna ardu pāliḫka
Line 13: Meṣḫarūtu (meṣḫerūtu), “youth.” How does this word influence one’s under-
standing of the prayer? How does this line fit with the next? Is there a contrast between
youth and old age or does the supplicant intend to show continuity of devotion throughout
life? It is difficult to say because a key word in the line, ma-ši-šu-ti, is obscure (see Hunt,
217–19 for the following options). The text is secure (against CAD M/2, 37), but the mean-
ing is uncertain. Deriving the term from the root mašāšu, “to wipe,” one might understand
the word as mašišūti, an adverbial accusative of condition, and translate it with regard to𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

the end result of wiping, “in a purified condition” (see Mayer, 472, “in gereinigtem
Zustand [?]”). However, the word may describe the wiping action itself rather than its
result. In this case, one might suppose that the supplicant’s hands were constantly moving
about—as if wiping something—while uplifted in prayer (see Karel van der Toorn, Sin and
Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia: A Comparative Study [SSN 22; Assen: Van Gorcum,
1985], 96 and 209, n.22, who translates the word “with ever fidgety hands” and sees a
contrast between youth and old age in lines 11 and 12). Suppû, “to pray.”
ina meṣḫarūtīya ma-ši-šu-ti usappa
Line 14: Šēbu (šību), “old person, elder.” The form is predicative (1cs). Note the life-
cycle contrast with line 13: youth to old age. DÙ = kalû, “all, totality”; but in construct,
kal(a), “all of, the whole of, everyone of.” Upnu, “hand.” Note the dual form with 1cs suf-
fix. Petû upnī, lit. “to open the hands”; more idiomatically, “to pray.” In line 14, upnu is the
subject (upnā is nom. dual) and petâ is 3fp predicative. This phrase may be punning on the
idiom discussed in the notes to line 2, petû uzna. If so, the line may imply that a petû upna,
“opening of the hand,” was one way to receive a petû uzna, “opening of the ear” (i.e., a
divine response). In any case, opening or raising one’s hands was a basic petitionary ritual
gesture in the ancient Near East (see Mayer I. Gruber, Aspects of Nonverbal Communication
in the Ancient Near East [Studia Pohl 12/1; Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1980], 50–59).
This gesture, of course, is closely related to the label that identifies many Mesopotamian
prayers, namely, šu-íl-lá = šuʾillakku, “(prayer of) lifted hands.”
šēbāku ana kal ilī petâ upnāya
Line 15: Lipin appi, lit. “stroking of the nose, prostration.” The word lipnu / libnu is
not recognized by the CAD (see L, 11 labānu); rather, see AHw, 551 or CDA, 182 under
libnu. Karû, “to be(come) short.” Notice the Assyrian form of the 3fs G perfect (with pre-
fixed ta– and harmonization of the second syllable’s vowel). With napaltu (= napaštu),
“life, throat, breath,” as the subject, the verb means, “to be(come) short of breath.” One
may wish to translate this phrase more idiomatically as a first person verb.

Line 16: IGI = pānu, “face.” Ina pāni, “in front of, before.” NAM . LÚ . U 18/19 . LU = amīlūtu
(awīlūtum), “humanity.” Kīma, “like, as.” Meḫû, “storm, whirlwind.” Anāku, “I.” How does
one explain this simile? A few suggestions: The simile may be a poetic expansion upon the
person’s breathlessness noted in line 15; it may indicate the speaker’s poor bodily condi-
tion; it may be an attempt to convey the speaker’s tumultuous life in broader human socie-
ty; or, in light of line 17, the simile may indicate the transitory character of the speaker’s
existence. In other contexts, meḫû in similes and metaphors conveys strength, chaos, and
even violence (see CAD M/2, 6). Since similes activate a field of associations, one need not
nail this simile down to one meaning.

Line 17: Notice the similarity between this line and line 3 (if the restoration is cor-
rect). Is the end of the prayer looking back to the beginning? See also line 19, assuming
the correctness of the restorations there. Ittatlakū is a Gt perfect of alāku, “to go, to walk”;
in the Gt, “to go away.” It makes little sense for “days to go away,” so one will need to
choose a verb in the translation that conveys the sense more idiomatically. Qatû, “to come
to an end, to finish.” As the line progresses it shows an intensification, depicted in the
action of the verbs (leaving vs. coming to an end) and the duration of time (days vs.
years). The supplicant, it seems, believes themselves to be as good as dead.

Line 18: SIG 5 = dumqu, “good fortune.” Nēmelu, “benefit, gain, profit.” As is common
in SB Akkadian, the nom. stands in place of the expected acc. case. TUKU = rašû, “to ac-
quire.” Since the first verb in the line is a preterite, the one from rašû is likely to be one as
well. Line 18 indicates a general absence of success throughout the speaker’s life.
ul āmur dumqa nēmelu lā arši
Line 19: Gešru (gašru), “powerful, mighty. Used substantively, this word was a very
common epithet for deities in Mesopotamian prayers. This line recapitulates the invocation
at the beginning of the prayer. Given its proximity to the conclusion of the prayer, one
might interpret this line as purely literary, creating a sort of ring structure in the prayer, or
as a rhetorical intensification, increasing the sense of urgency within the prayer. In the
latter case, this line insures the deity’s attention just before stating the petition in the fol-
lowing line.
aplu kēnu Nabû gešru
Line 20: Notice again, if the restorations are correct, the harking back to words from
the beginning of the prayer: ṣabātu also occurs in line 2 (restored). Here the preterite may
have a performative sense, and may thus be best rendered with a present. Si ? -pe-e-ka is
obscure. It may be sīpu, “prayer.” Thus, aṣbat sīpēka, literally, “I seize your prayers”; more
idiomatically, “I pray to you” (see CAD Ṣ, 32 for an analogy). The word may also be sippu,
“doorjamb.” If so, then the line may merely indicate that the speaker has come to Nabu’s
temple for supplication, “I take hold of your (temple’s) doorjambs.” In any case, line 20a
remains uncertain. Kullumu, “to show.” The verb form is a D ms imperative with 1cs suffix:
kullimmanni stands here for kullimanni, as is evident from MS A’ S ritual section, which reads
kul-li-ma-an-ni (see line 29). ZÁLAG = nūru, “light.” (A variant in Mayer’s MS B reads: lūmur
nūru, “let me see the light.”) One may think on first glance to interpret the phrase kulli-
manni nūra, “show me the light,” in terms of a revelatory experience (or perhaps even a
wish for death). The idiom, however, derives from the imagery of a prisoner being set free
from a dark prison cell. See CAD K, 524. In light of Nabu’s ability to turn back the anger of
one’s personal deities (lines 9–10) and in light of the fact that the speaker seems to have𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1

had a lifetime without good fortune, it may be that the freedom the speaker seeks is free-
dom from divine displeasure. However, one might also consider, since the speaker believes
themselves to be at the end of their years, that this wish is a desire to be freed from death
itself, the final prison of all the living.

Line 21: Narbû, “greatness,” pl. “great deeds.” Šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to proclaim, to
announce.” This verb and the one in 21b are precatives, “let me. . . .” Dalīlū, “praises.”
Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and
its object both come from the same root. One should translate this idiomatically, “let me
proclaim your praises” or the like. Shuilla-prayers almost always conclude with some form
of foreword looking praise. The phrases narbīka lušāpi and dalīlīka ludlul are very common-
ly used for this purpose (see CAD A/2, 202–3).
narbīka lušāpi dalīlīka ludlul
Line 22: This line is the rubric, that is, it tells something about the classification of
the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it
is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian. It may be translated, “it is the
wording of a lifted-hand to Nabu.”
Line 23: DÙ . DÙ . BI = epuštašu, “its ritual.” KI = qaqqaru, “ground.” SAR = šabāṭu, “to

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
A few idioms in the prayer are worthy of our comparative attention. The
phrase pētû ḫasīsu, “the one who opens the ear,” in line 2 is comparable to the
BH phrase ‫ן‬ ֶ‫אֹז‬ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ח‬ ‫ת‬ ַ ‫פּ‬ ָ , “to open the ear” (Isa 50:5 and 48:8) and the similar ‫ה‬ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫גּ‬ ָ
‫ן‬ ֶ‫אֹז‬ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬,
“to uncover the ear” (see 1 Sam 9:15, 20:2, 12, 13, 22:8 (2x’s), 22:17, 2
Sam 7:27, Isa 22:14, Job 33:16, 36:10, 15, Ruth 4:4, and 1 Chron 17:25). In ref-
erence to human activity, the Hebrew idioms mean “to inform” (e.g., 1 Sam
20:13). When a deity is the one informing a human, however, the idiom denotes
revelatory activity (e.g., 1 Sam 9:15 and Isa 50:5). The means of conveying the
information may be different (e.g., a dream, prophetic intuition, or the scribal
tradition, as our prayer implies), but the Hebrew and Akkadian phrases desig-
nate the same mythological idea: a deity somehow informs a human of some-
thing he or she would not otherwise have known apart from the deity.𒌋𒐍 A S HUILLA : N ABU 1
335
Turru (D of târu) gimilla, “to return a kindness, to avenge,” in line 4 com-
pares to the BH phrase ‫מוּל‬ ְ‫גּ‬ ‫יב‬ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ‫ה‬,
“to return in kind,” and ‫מוּל‬ ְ‫גּ‬ ‫ם‬ ‫לּ‬ ֵ ‫שׁ‬,
“to repay in
kind.” As with the Akkadian phrase, the BH phrases can indicate something ei-
ther positive or negative, depending on the situation. The idea is simply that one
receives treatment (i.e., requital) in accord with one’s own actions (see Obad
15). The phrases are usually used negatively, designating a payment of retribu-
tion against evildoers, the proud, or enemies (see, e.g., Ps 28:4, 94:2, Isa 66:6,
Jer 51:6, and Ps 137:8). But the positive use is also attested (see Prov 19:17 and
2 Chron 32:25). For the two phrases in the same context (of requiting an ene-
my), see Joel 4:4.
The idiom suḫḫuru kišāda (or pānī), “to turn the neck (or face) back toward
or away from,” when used negatively (i.e., in the sense of “away from”) com-
pares conceptually 1 to the common BH idea of the deity hiding his face (‫יר‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ
‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬,
see, e.g., Pss 13:2, 27:9, 44:25, 69:18, 88:15, 102:3, and 143:7). As Ps
143:7 indicates, when the deity hides his face, the supplicant feels like one
headed for the grave. The opposite of the deity hiding his face is the deity mak-
ing his face to shine upon, i.e., to be happy with, an individual (‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫יר‬ ‫א‬ ִ ‫ה‬,
see, e.g., Pss 31:17, 67:2, 80:4, 8, 20, 119:135, and of course Num 6:25). As in
Mesopotamia, devotees in ancient Israel desired the protective attention of their
deity at all times.
Turning to a more thematic level of comparison, one can see that our Akka-
dian prayer presents a supplicant advanced in years, perhaps at death’s gates. Ps
71, a lament of the individual, depicts a comparable supplicant and is therefore
related, thematically-speaking. 2 In this psalm the supplicant explicitly recounts
their devotion during not only their youth (vv. 5 and 17) but even from birth (v.
6)! They fear, however, in their old age (‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ִ‫ז‬ ‫ת‬ ‫ע‬,
v. 9a, and ‫ה‬ ‫יב‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ִ‫ז‬, v. 18),
when they most need the deity (‫י‬ ‫ֹח‬ ִ ‫כּ‬ ‫לוֹת‬ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫כּ‬,
“when my strength is failing,” v. 9b),
Yahweh has cast them aside ( ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫יכ‬
‫ל‬ ִ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫ל־‬ ‫א‬ ַ , v. 9), abandoned them ( ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ב‬ ֵ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ַ  ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ַ , vv. 9
and 18a), and become distant ( ‫ק‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ל־‬ ‫א‬ ַ , v. 12). This abandonment is not death
as we define it (i.e., cessation of bodily functions) because it is precisely during
this period of divine absence that the supplicant fears their enemies will over-
take them (vv. 10–11). Viewed from the perspective of their own ancient Israel-
ite milieu, however, the supplicant was as good as dead, so that they describe
their restoration as nothing less than a kind of resurrection: “you will make me
live again and draw me up again out of the depths” (i.e., Sheol) (‫שׁוּב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫י‬ ִ‫ינ‬ ֵ‫יּ‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ְ
‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫שׁוּב‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫הֹמוֹת‬ ‫תּ‬ ְ ‫;וּמ‬
v. 20). 3 The supplicant alternates between praise, la-
1
There are attestations of turning (‫שׁוּב‬ in the hiphil) the face toward (e.g., Dan 11:18) or away
from (e.g., Ezek 14:6) someone or something in BH, of course, but this idiom does not convey
the idea of divine abandonment or renewal of attention.
2
For old age in ancient Israel, see J. Gordon Harris, “Old Age,” ABD 4:10–12.

For this qualified notion of resurrection, see Jon D. Levenson, Resurrection and the Restoration
of Israel: The Ultimate Victory of the God of Life (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2006), 35–66.336ment, and petition throughout the psalm but ends like our Akkadian prayer with
praise, though here it is much more extensive (vv. 22–24).

A Shuilla: Nergal 2
T ZVI A BUSCH
N ERGAL :
Nergal is a god of death and of war (as the one who inflicts death in war).
The name Nergal probably means, or at least was understood as, d nin-uru-gal-
(ak), “Lord of the great city (i.e., the netherworld).” The standard writing of the
name Nergal is d GÌR-eri 11 -gal (GÌR here is read by some as nè); this writing is
gradually replaced by d U . GUR . The writing u.gur has been interpreted by W. G.
Lambert as uqur, the imperative of naqāru, “to destroy.” 1 The name Nergal in our
text is written both as d U . GUR and as d GÌR-eri 11 -gal. Nergal’s main temple, É-mes-
lam, “house, warrior of the netherworld,” is in Cutha, where he is also called
Meslamtaʾea, “the one who comes forth from the Meslam.” His parentage is Nip-
purian: Enlil and Ninlil. He is associated with the planet Mars as well as with the
netherworld. (In the myth Nergal and Ereshkigal, he takes his place as its ruler
together with Ereshkigal.) Thus, he has a place both in heaven and in the neth-
erworld (see lines 5–8).

“Studies in Nergal,” BiOr 5/6 (1973), 356.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer to Nergal is an excellent example of a shuilla-prayer. It contains
the three expected sections: a hymnic introduction in which the god is invoked
and described (1–10); a supplication containing the self-presentation of the peti-
tioner, a description of his difficulty, his approach to the god, and his request
(11–23); and a promise of praise (24). The sections are clearly articulated and
coherent; they are thematically well-developed and have a formal shape. I limit
my comments here to the hymnic introduction and to lines 15–18 where the
speaker sets out the features of Nergal that have encouraged him to approach
the god.
Hymnic Introduction: The hymnic introduction is devoted to the descriptive
praise of Nergal. It contains three stanzas that are syntactically linked together.
They treat the god’s nature and place in a divine family (lines 1–4); his place in
339340the cosmos (lines 5–8); and his relationship to the world of humans and animals
(lines 9–10).
The first stanza treats two themes: the god’s nature as a warrior (a) and his
place in a divine family (b). Each line is made up of two half-lines; the lines
form couplets and the two couplets form a stanza. The two aforementioned
themes are integrated and laid out chiastically. Notice that the chiasm is re-
versed in the second couplet:
1.
a
b
×
2. bʹ aʹ
3. b ( )
×
4.
aʹ
bʹ
Note, however, that the composer deviated from the chiastic pattern in the sec-
ond part of line 3, where instead of presenting a feature of Nergal’s power
(theme a), he provides an epithet of Kutushar, Nergal’s mother, thus explicating
and expanding on the first half of the line.
The second stanza describes the god’s place in the cosmos. Here, again, the
composer follows a formal structure. Each couplet contains two parallel lines.
Yet, here, the form is different from that of lines 1–4, for lines 5–6 are each
made up of two independent (though obviously associated) clauses, whereas
both lines 7 and 8 form single clauses. Common themes and, even more, the
distribution of grammatical forms between lines and between couplets, draw
together each of the individual subsections and, then, the stanza as a whole.
That is, grammatically, line 5a parallels line 6a, and line 7a parallels line 8a;
moreover, whereas the first half-lines draw together each of the two subsections
(lines 5–6 and 7–8), the latter halves draw together the stanza as a whole, for
the corresponding half-lines 5b/7b and 6b/8b share syntactic forms:
5a. 2ms pred. + prep. (ina) + region
6a. 2ms pred. + prep. (ina) + region
7a. prep. (itti) DN(s) + prep. (ina) + region
8a. prep. (itti) DN(s) + prep. (ina) + region
5b. pred.+ subject with 2ms suffix
6b. object + prefixed verb (2ms)
7b. subject with 2ms suffix + pred.
8b. prefixed verb (2ms) + object
Whereas the parallel lines of each couplet have the same syntax and grammati-
cal word order in their first half, the latter halves of these lines correspond in
respect to their syntax not with each other, but rather with those of the other
couplet: 5b/7b, 6b/8b. Note, moreover, the chiastic arrangement of the gram-
matical forms in the corresponding lines of the two couplets (5b × 7b, 6b ×
8b). Thus, the first half-lines define and draw together the individual couplets,
and the final half-lines define and draw together the stanza as a whole.
The third stanza describes the god’s relationship to humans and animals,
thus bringing the god down to earth and serving as a prelude to the petitioner’s𒌋𒑆 A S HUILLA : N ERGAL 2

call upon the god in the next section. This stanza is made up of two clauses, each
of which extends over a whole poetic line. But in contrast to lines 7–8, the
clauses in lines 9–10 are connected by the enclitic –ma attached to iddikkā-ma of
line 9 and thus form a longer sentence.
Thus, lines 1–4 comprise a series of hemistichs where each half contrasts
with the other, lines 5–6 comprise a series of hemistichs where each half sup-
plements the other, lines 7–8 comprise full clauses, and finally lines 9–10 have
two full clauses that are connected with each other. The types of clauses form a
sequence that unify the hymn and move from an arena where the gods alone
exist to areas of concern to humans, from the poetic divine to the prosaic hu-
man, from the world of the divine alluded to by compact poetic images to the
world of the human depicted in drawn out prosaic descriptions.
Approach to the God: In lines 15–18 the speaker then points to the features
of Nergal that have encouraged him to approach the god. Before laying out the
structure and form of these lines, I should first note that against the majority of
witnesses, I follow Mayer’s MS B (K.2836+) in placing our line 17 before line 18
because muppalsāta of line 18 should, I think, lead directly into naplisannī-ma of
line 19. Contrary to this order, these lines are transposed in the other MSS and in
the main edition of Mayer. Lines 15, 16, 17, 18, as I number them in the present
treatment, parallel each other. More specifically, the opening hemistichs of lines
15–18 all contain: aššum + a predicative adjectival form which describes a per-
manent feature of the divine addresee + a 2ms subject pronominal suffix (gam-
malāta ‖ tayyārāta ‖ rēmēnêta ‖ muppalsāta). The second hemistichs of these lines
all contain verbs in the same grammatical form: 1cs perfect + either a 2ms ob-
ject pronominal suffix or an accusative noun + a 2ms possessive pronominal
suffix. The verbs in the opening halves of these lines seem to be synonymous. On
the other hand, the verbs in the latter halves seem to represent a meaningful
sequence or progression of movement towards the presence of the god: search-
ing for him, focusing upon him, standing before him, looking at him, all done in
preparation for making a request from him (lines 19–23).

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This is the superscript, marking the
beginning of the ritual wording. It is not part of the prayer. Bēlu, “lord.” Gašru, “very
strong, powerful.” Tizqāru, “exalted.” This adjective describes the god’s status (and not his
strength) and thus modifies the nomen regens of the following construct chain and not the
preceding noun. The pattern of this adjective is pitrāsu; our form is due to metathesis re-
sulting from the sibilant z: *zitqāru > tizqāru. Bukru, “son.” In Akkadian, in contrast to
biblical Hebrew, bukru is not limited to the firstborn. d Nunamnir, the father of Nergal, is
here a name of Enlil. The name reflects that god’s authority: Nu(n)-nam-nir, “prince of
sovereignty” or “the one of sovereignty.”
šiptu: bēlu gašru tizqāru bukur Nunamnir
Line 2: In this line the composer brings together Nergal’s roles as ruling god of the
netherword and as god of war. Ašarēdu, “foremost.” The Anunnakki here refer to the gods
of the netherworld. EN = bēlu, see line 1. Tamḫāru, “battle, combat.”
ašarēd Anunnakkī bēl tamḫāri
Line 3: Ilittu, “offspring.” d Kutušar, a mother goddess, the mother of Nergal; here, it is
probably a name of Ninlil. The name reflects that goddess’s function as a mother goddess
(see the Sumerian myth Enlil and Ninlil, where Ninlil gives birth to Nanna, Nergal, Ninazu,
and Enbilulu). Šarratu, “queen.” Rabû (m), rabītu (f), “great.”
ilitti Kutušar šarrati rabīti
Line 4: Kaškaššu, “all powerful.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Narāmu, “beloved.” The
goddess Ninmena here is the wife of Nergal, though she appears elsewhere as his mother.
Nergal kaškaš ilī narām Ninmenna
Line 5: Šūpâta is a 2ms predicative of šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to be(come) manifest, bril-
liant.” Ina, “in.” Šamû, “heavens.” KÙ . MEŠ = ellūtu, “pure.” Šaqû, “to be(come) elevated.”
Šaqu is the 3ms predicative form. Manzāzu (mazzāzu), lit. “position, place of standing.”
Here the word has the astral meaning “station, position” in the heavens, referring to Mars.
Ina šamê ellūti (line 5) and ina arallî (line 6) are syntactically part of the first half of each
line, but also apply to the second half.

Line 6: Rabû, “to be big, great.” Rabâta is the 2ms predicative form. É . KUR . ÚŠ = aral-
lû, a name of the netherworld. Māḫiru, “rival, opponent.” Lā, “not.” Išû, “to have.”
rabâta ina arallî māḫira lā tīšu
Line 7: Itti, “with.” Ea is god of wisdom, water, and magic (see page 227). UKKIN =
puḫru, “assembly.” Milku, “counsel, advice.” Šūtur is a 3ms predicative of šūturu (Š of
[w]atāru), “to be preeminent.” In line 7, LKA 30 and PBS 1/2 119 (Mayer’s MSS F and G
from Ashur and Babylonia, respectively) read d A-ni 7 . In line 8, PBS 1/2 119 adds u KI -tì,
thus reading šamê u erṣeti. If we follow the main text of lines 7–8, then we have a chiastic
arrangement a-b-bʹ-aʹ in lines 5–8: a. heaven (line 5); b. institution, i.e., netherworld (line
6); bʹ. institution, i.e., council (line 7); aʹ. heaven (line 8). But the pattern in the variant
texts (especially šamê u erṣeti in line 8) seems to be different.
itti Ea ina puḫur ilī milikka šūtur
Line 8: d 30 = Sîn, the moon god (see page 385). Šeʾû, “to observe.” The form is a G
2ms durative. Gimru, “totality, everything.”
itti Sîn ina šamê tašeʾʾi gimri
Line 9: Nadānu, “to give.” The signs id-din-ka present a morphographemic writing.
The final radical of the root assimilates into the initial consonant of the 2ms pronominal
suffix, thus id-din-ka is transcribed iddikka. d EN . LÍL = Ellil, the father of Nergal. Abu, “fa-
ther.” Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” refers to mankind. Napištu, “life.”
iddikkā-ma Ellil abūka ṣalmāt qaqqadi puḫur napišti
Line 10: Būlu, “animals, livestock.” Šakkan was the divine protector of wild animals.
Nammaššû (nammaštû), “wild animals.” Qātu, “hand.” Qātukka is the noun qātu with the
locative-adverbial ending (–um) plus a 2ms possessive suffix. Here, however, the locative
ending has a terminative meaning, ana, “to(ward).” The m of the ending assimilates to the
k of the 2ms pronominal suffix. Paqādu, “to entrust, to care for, to appoint.”

Line 11: Anāku, “I.” NENNI = annanna, “so-and-so.” A = māru, “son.” ÌR = ardu (war-
dum), “servant.” In place of the generic formula, “I (am) so-and-so, the son of so-and-so,
your servant,” of line 11, two MSS (Mayer’s MSS B and G) add different expanded versions

B adds the so-called attalû (“eclipse”) formula to the self-presentation formula, which
names Ashurbanipal (see Mayer, UFBG, 100–102 for a brief discussion). MS G attests a
longer self-presentation, naming Shamash-shum-ukin, adds the attalû formula but without
the line mentioning the eclipse (see UFBG, 101, n.65), and also includes a sterotypical
lament and petition for the removal of the evil (UFBG, 73–75 and 265–69).

Line 12: Šibsātu, “anger,” is a feminine plural. The construct form is šibsāt. Note the
plural form of the verb. IŠ 8 . DAR = ištaru, “goddess.” Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed,”
here “to beset.” The form iššaknūnim is a 3mp preterite with a 1cs dative suffix. This line is
omitted in MS G. The omission comes immediately after the introduction of Shamash-
shum-ukin as the speaker of the text and the request that the evil portended by signs not
affect the palace and land. The omission may be due to the fact that when the scribe intro-𒌋𒑆 A S HUILLA : N ERGAL 2

that the evil signs mentioned in this insertion were meant to replace “the anger of the god
and goddess” as the cause of the difficulties described in lines 13 and 14.)

Line 13: ZI . GA = ṣītu, “expenses.” Ḫuluqqû (ḫuluqqāʾu), “losses.” Nabšû (N of bašû), “to
befall, to occur.” The form is a 3mp preterite. É = bītu, “house.” MU = “my,” the 1cs pos-
sessive suffix in Sumerian. It may represent either the Akk. pronominal suffix –ya or –ī,
depending on the case of the noun to which it is attached.
ṣītu u ḫuluqqû ibbašû ina bītīya
Line 14: Qabû: “to speak, to command.” Šemû, “to hear, to listen.” Both forms are G
infinitives, nom. case. The inf. is neutral in regard to voice; hence, šemû should be under-
stood as “to be heard” (passive) and not “to hear” (active). Nadlupu (N of dalāpu), “to keep
awake” (transitive). The form is a 3mp preterite with a 1cs accusative pronominal suffix.
qabû u lā šemû iddalpūninni
Line 15: The opening hemistichs of lines 15, 16, 17, and 18 all contain aššum + ad-
jectival forms serving as predicates, which describe a permanent feature of the divine ad-
dressee. The closing hemistichs of lines 15, 16, 17, and 18 all contain 1cs perfect verbs
with either a 2ms object pronominal suffix or an accusative noun plus 2ms possessive pro-
nominal suffix. Aššum, “because, on account of.” Gammalu, “very merciful, gracious, spar-
ing.” The adjective is predicative (2ms); see also the forms in lines 16 and 17. Saḫāru, “to
turn (toward).” Assaḫur is a 1cs perfect (see also the forms in lines 16–18). The t has assim-
ilated to the s. DINGIR -ut = ilūtu, “godhead, divinity.”

Line 17: All of the MSS but one transposes our lines 17 and 18. I follow, however, MS
B, in which these lines are ordered as above because muppalsāta of our line 18 should lead
directly to naplisannī-ma of line 19. The reading re-mé-né-ta follows MS A. Rēmēnû, “merci-
ful.” Izuzzu, “to stand.” Maḫarka, “before you.”

Line 21: Paṭāru, “to release, to forgive.” The form is a ms impv. Annu (arnu), “sin,

nominal suffix.
puṭur annī ḫiṭītī u gillatī
Line 22: Kiṣir libbi, lit., “a knot of the heart/innards,” means “anger, indignation.”
Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released.” The form is a 3cs precative.
kiṣir libbi ilūtīka rabīti . . . lippašir
Line 23: d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” zenûtu, šabsūtu, and kitmulūtu are all mp verbal ad-
jectives (nominative) that mean “angry” or the like. Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace (with).”
KI . MU = ittīya, “with me.”

Line 24: Narbû, “greatness,” pl. “great deeds.” Šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to proclaim, to
announce.” Both verbs in the line are 1cs precatives. Dalīlū, “praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.”
Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construction; that is, the verb and its object both
come from the same root. One should translate this idiomatically, “let me proclaim your
praises” or the like.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In 2 Kgs 17:24 the people of Cutha are said to have been settled in Samaria
subsequent to the conquest and deportation of northern Israel, and in v. 30 the
people of Cutha are described as worshipping Nergal. In Jer 39:3, 13 Nergal
appears in the PN ‫ר‬ ‫צ‬ ֶ ‫ר־א‬
‫שׂ‬ ַ ‫ל‬ ‫ג‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ְ ֵ‫נ‬ , Nergal-sar-ezer, an official of the Babylonian king
(for the name, see HALOT, 723b). Nergal is identified with the western Resheph
(see Wiggermann, 216, 218, 222), a god of battle, death, and disease, who is
armed with bow and arrow. Resheph appears in demonic form in the Hebrew
Bible as the personification of pestilence (see Deut 32:24, Hab 3:5, and Job 5:7).
For points of specific interest in the Hebrew Bible and later Hebrew, I note
the following: With arallû (line 6) compare ‫ל‬ ‫יא‬
‫ר‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֲ / ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ַ in Ezek 43:15, which
Albright thought was a loan word from arallû (see HALOT, 87b). With Enlil’s
placing of animals under the control of Nergal (lines 9–10) compare Ps 8:7–9,
especially v. 8. For ṣītu u ḫuluqqu (line 13), “expenses and losses,” compare later
Hebrew ‫ואבדות‬ ‫הוצאות‬ , as well as Aramaic ‫נפקתא‬ and ‫אבדתא‬. With the descrip-
tions of the deity in the first hemistichs in lines 15–18, gammalāta, tayyārāta,
rēmēnêta, muppalsāta, compare respectively Hebrew ‫נוּן‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫גמל‬, ‫שׁוב‬/‫סלח‬, ‫חוּם‬ ‫ר‬, ָ and
‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ַ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫יר‬ ‫א‬ ִ ‫מ‬.
T RANSLATION :
1. Mighty lord, exalted son of Nunamnir,
2. Foremost among the Anunnakki, lord of battle,
3. Offspring of Kutushar, the great queen,
4. Nergal, all powerful among the gods, beloved of Ninmenna.
5. You are manifest in the bright heavens, your station is exalted,

A Shuilla: Nisaba 1
C HRISTOPHER F RECHETTE
N ISABA :
In the Mesopotamian pantheon, Nisaba was the goddess of grain and of the
scribal arts and was accorded familial associations with several major gods. The
Sumerogram d NISABA can signify either this goddess’s name or a general term for
grain. Nisaba was considered the oldest child of Enlil and a daughter of Urash,
ancestor of Anu. In first millennium texts, she was considered a daughter of Anu
or Ea, and therefore an aunt or sister of Marduk. In the Ur III and OB periods,
her spouse was Ḫaya, but in the first millennium Nabu was considered her
spouse, apparently because of their shared association with the scribal arts. 1 In
the OB period, Nabu and Nisaba are attested as personal gods of scribes. 2 A tab-
let found at the site of the Temple of Nabu at Nimrud (CTN IV, no. 168) and
identified by a note on its left edge as “shuillas of great and exalted goddesses”
contains seven prayers with ritual instructions to four goddesses (Nisaba, Ishtar,
Tashmetu, and Nanaya), their common characteristic being a spousal or love
relationship to Nabu. 3 The first two prayers on the tablet are to Nisaba, the first
of which is the present prayer.
The cult of Nisaba, about which there is little information, dates as early as
the ED period and seems to have been limited primarily to Nippur, where she
was worshipped at the temple of her daughter Ninlil; no temples dedicated to
her are yet attested. 4 Despite the fact that her status seems to have waned by the

While Nabu was considered a spouse of Nisaba in the late period, Nabu’s more long-standing
consorts were initially Tashmetu and later Nanaya (see Francesco Pomponio, “Nabû. A. Philolo-
gisch,” RlA 9 [1998–2001], 16–24). Nanaya, the goddess of erotic love and the mistress of Nabu,
belonged to the circle of Ishtar, with whom she was at some points syncretized (Marten Stol,
“Nanaja,” RlA 9 [1998–2001], 146–51). In Nabu’s home city of Borsippa, both Nanaya and
Tashmetu were identified as “queens of Borsippa” (Paul-Alain Beaulieu, The Pantheon of Uruk
During the Neo-Babylonian Period [Cuneiform Monographs 23; Leiden/Boston: Brill/Styx, 2003],

351352OB period, her association with writing and grain remained. As with Nabu, a
stylus served as her emblem. 5 At present, while no iconographic depiction of
Nisaba can be identified with certainty, it is possible that among representations
of deities associated with vegetation, e.g., anthropomorphic figures with branch-
es above their shoulders or in their hands, some may depict her. 6
Nisaba was not included among the elite of the Mesopotamian pantheon.
Nevertheless, combined with her familial relationships to Ea, Enlil, and Nabu,
the associations of Nisaba with grain and with the scribal arts suggest that she
was regarded as wielding significant influence among the gods. Indeed, her abil-
ity to influence other deities is central to the present prayer. For, as do many
Akkadian shuilla-prayers of the āšipu, this prayer asks a deity to intercede with
other deities, specifically the client’s personal god and goddess, in order to gain
forgiveness and reconciliation. Grain was the most important food for people in
Mesopotamian society, and consequently it was the most important type of offer-
ing in Mesopotamian rituals. 7 Moreover, feeding a deity was understood to ren-
der him or her receptive to petition. Since the gods were believed to rely on food
offerings, and since grain was the most important of these, the grain used to
pacify the gods through offerings ritually manifested her influential capacity.
Her association with the scribal arts linked her influence to the enactment of this
ritual prayer. Vital throughout Mesopotamian culture, the scribal arts held par-
ticular importance for ritual experts. Written records allowed these scholars to
preserve for their use the sacred traditions of the very ritual prayers and actions
employed to engage the gods properly in order to gain their favor.
T HE P RAYER :
Nisaba 1 provides a window into the multi-faceted rationale by which ele-
ments of ritual functioned in first-millennium Mesopotamian religion. Based on
its language, literary form, classifying rubric, and inclusion within the craft of
the āšipu, this ritual-prayer may be classified as an Akkadian shuilla. 8 Typical of
such ritual-prayers, it functioned in part to gain the intercession of Nisaba in
reconciling personal gods and speaker. However, the instructions describing the
context of its recitation indicate that it functioned also to prepare a material for
use in ritual activity, a function atypical of Akkadian shuillas but found in a
number of incantations which modern scholars have called Kultmittelbeschwör-
ungen (see page 29). Blending both functions this ritual-prayer manifests the
powerful influence of Nisaba for reconciling individuals with their angry deities.

As explained in the general introduction, in this book the term “shuilla” refers to the ritual
prayer as a whole, including the recited text and associated ritual activity; the term “shuilla-
prayer” refers specifically to the text of the prayer.
6𒌋𒌋 A S HUILLA : N ISABA 1

Its four known exemplars and two texts preserving its incipit, all date to the first
millennium and come from diverse locations, including Nineveh, Sippar, and
Kalḫu. 9
The first part of the classifying rubric appended to this prayer fits the typi-
cal form for this class of shuilla-prayer: “wording of a ‘lifted-hand’ to DN” (ka-
inim-ma šu-íl-la (2) d DN-ke 4 ). The term “lifted-hand” in this context likely refers to
the composite ritual activity of spoken words and attendant actions among
which a gesture of hand-lifting was likely assumed by the ritual specialist (see
discussion in the introduction, p. 35). While most such classifying rubrics con-
clude with the name of the deity, both of the exemplars of this prayer that are
not broken away after the name of the goddess continue by clarifying that it is
“for turning away divine anger” (dingir-šà-dib-ba gur-ru-da-kám). This Sumerian
phrase identifies a class of ritual-prayers of the āšipu that are typically addressed
to the personal deities whose anger is at issue (see the discussion in the intro-
duction, page 40). 10 The present prayer, like the other Akkadian shuilla-prayers,
is not directed to a personal deity but to one of the “high gods,” and like many
of them asks Nisaba to intercede with the speaker’s angry personal gods. Since
Akkadian shuillas commonly declare the petitioner’s desire to be reconciled with
angry deities, the rubric’s inclusion of the words “for turning away divine anger”
may be interpreted as emphasizing or further specifying the purpose of this par-
ticular shuilla-prayer. Such additional identifying rubrics, while rare, are attest-
ed among Akkadian shuillas. (See page 29 in the introduction.)
Like other shuilla-prayers, which range from twenty to thirty lines in length,
Nisaba 1 includes several standard elements in typical sequence but is relatively
short. Four lines of address characterize the deity (lines 1–4), three lines of peti-
tion seek her intercession to reconcile personal deities with the client (lines 5–
7), and three lines seek forgiveness of the client’s sins (lines 14–16). The prayer
concludes with a single line offering to praise the goddess (line 17).
One exemplar, our MS A, which is in NB script and was apparently written
for a specific occasion, includes an insertion of several formulaic elements after
the section seeking reconciliation: an identification of the speaker as Shamash-
shum-ukin (lines 8–9), 11 a complaint concerning omens portending evil fates
9
Since a new edition of this prayer is in press and not yet available at the time of writing, a
summary of the textual witnesses is in order. The four exemplars of this prayer are MS A = BM
78219; MS B = K.6028; MS C = K.3392; MS D = ND 5493 = IM 67630. Two texts preserve only
the incipit: MS E = BM 122647 and MS F = K.2798+. In the current transliteration and transla-
tion, lines 1–13 follow MS A; line 14 completes MS C with MS D; line 15 follows MS D; lines 16–17
follow MS C; and lines 18–19 complete MS C with MS D.

Shamash-shum-ukin, whose name means “Shamash has firmly established a name” (Akk.
Šamaš-šum-ukīn), reigned as king of Babylon from 667–648 BCE . He was a son of Esarhaddon and
older brother of Ashurbanipal and succeeded to the throne of Babylon after the death of their
father in 669 BCE . Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria from 668–c.630 BCE , began fighting to supplant
Shamash-shum-ukin in 652 BCE ; the latter died (or was killed) in 648 BCE . See Grant Frame,
“Šamaš-šuma-ukīn,” RlA 11 (2008), 618–21.354(lines 10–11), and a petition for protection from those fates (lines 12–13). Based
on this exemplar alone, the end of which is broken, we cannot know the precise
ritual context of that occasion. However, considerable evidence indicates that
shuilla-rituals were sometimes carried out in conjunction with namburbi-rituals,
whose explicit purpose was to dissolve the calamitous fate portended by an
omen (see the introduction, page 36). Such may have been the case for this ex-
emplar.
The complaint in lines 10–11 is a variation on a formulaic expression of con-
cern over unfavorable omens. 12 Such a complaint is usually followed by one or
more statements in which the speaker expresses fear, turns to the deity, requests
the deity’s attention, or petitions for help. In MS A, however, such a statement is
absent. Consequently, the element of complaint takes the form of a lengthy
prepositional phrase that is grammatically subordinate to the petition:
ina lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ
lumuššina ayyâši u ekallīya
ayy-iṭḫâm ayy-isniq ayy-iqrib ayy-ikšudanni
Concerning (ina) [the evil omens]
That occurred in my palace and my land,
May their evil towards me and my palace
Not approach, not come near,
not come close, not reach me!
This sentence is comprehensible, but awkward. An exemplar of the prayer Ner-
gal 2 contains a nearly identical insertion which also names Shamash-shum-
ukin, but that exemplar adds a line to the complaint-element. 13 As a result, the
complaint is no longer couched in a subordinate prepositional phrase, but forms
a complete sentence expressing the king’s anxiety:
ina lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ
palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku
lumuššina ayyâši u ekallīya
ayy-iṭḫâm ayy-isniq ayy-iqrib ayy-ikšudanni
As a result of (ina) [the evil omens]
That occurred in my palace and my land,
I am afraid, anxious, and panicked.
May their evil towards me and my palace
Not approach, not come near,
not come close, not reach me!
12
While Werner Mayer includes this complaint formula among exemplars of the so-called “attalû
formula” concerning a lunar eclipse that portends evil for the king’s palace and land, the present
insertion lacks the formula’s first line, which mentions the eclipse (UFBG, 100–102). Of the
twenty-eight occurrences of this formula noted by Mayer, twenty-four occur in shuilla-prayers;
occurrences in the present insertion and in one exemplar of Nergal 2 are the only two in which
the first line, which mentions the eclipse, does not occur. (For a list of all exemplars of this for-
mula see UFBG, 100, n. 64. For a transliteration of the insertion in this exemplar of Nergal 2, see
UFBG, 480, Text G, lines 12ʹ–18ʹ and page 344 in this book.) Moreover, Mayer describes another
complaint formula that is strikingly similar to the attalû formula, but it lacks the line concerning
the eclipse altogether and refers to evil that threatens the ordinary person’s house and person,
not the king’s palace (Formula α, UFBG, 102–3). The self-identification formula, which may or
may not immediately precede either of these two complaint formulas, may function either as a
subject for what follows or as an independent clause (see UFBG, 46–52).

355
The insertion as it appears in Nergal 2 avoids the dubious syntax of Nisaba 1 and
clarifies the logical connection between the king’s predicament and his petition.
Moreover, this additional line, palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, constitutes a stock
phrase found in parallel formulas in many Akkadian shuilla-prayers and so was
arguably omitted by mistake. Consequently, it makes sense to restore this line.
In most cases, an Akkadian shuilla would have been carried out “in front of”
(ina/ana maḫar) a deity manifest either in its astral form or in the form of a cult
image or standard. 14 The three exemplars of the full text of Nisaba 1 for which
the end of the prayer is preserved all include the same brief ritual instruction:
the prayer is to be recited not to the deity by name but to a certain type of inex-
pensive flour (maṣḫatu) used almost exclusively for ritual offerings. 15 This flour,
then, was presumably identified as a manifestation of the goddess Nisaba.
The ritual instructions on the preserved exemplars of Nisaba 1 only indicate
recitation of the prayer to the flour. As in any written ritual instruction from
Mesopotamia, however, one ought not to presume that ritual actions were lim-
ited to what is written. Indeed, flour as a ritual offering was typically scattered
(sarāqu) either upon a censer or the animal offering and could be mixed with
other ingredients such as water or oil before being poured. 16 A similar but more
detailed instruction for the recitation of this prayer in the ritual tablet for the
elaborate Bīt salāʾ mê (“house of water-sprinkling”) royal ritual confirms such a
usage. 17 The ritual instructions call first for setting up an altar and for making an
offering in front of maṣḫatu-flour and then for the recitation of Nisaba 1. After
the making of an offering to the planet Jupiter (which is identified with Mar-
duk), the same maṣḫatu-flour is poured out or scattered, presumably as part of
the offering to Jupiter/Marduk.
As mentioned above, although Nisaba 1 is addressed to maṣḫatu-flour, nei-
ther the prayer nor its ritual activity fits neatly with what is typical of
Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Rather, evidence for the ritual context of Nisaba 1 in Bīt
14
Ritual instructions appended to copies of shuilla-prayers vary greatly in the degree of detail
given and in many cases do not identify the deity before whom the prayer is recited or the offer-
ing set up. However, when the recipient of an offering or prayer is indicated, it is typically a
name for the deity addressed in the prayer. Some Mesopotamian deities have more than one
name. For instance, the god Ea may also be referred to as Enlilbanda (see page 227).

Bīt salāʾ mê was carried out from the fourth to the eight of Tashritu during the fall New Year’s
festival in Babylon. Claus Ambos, “Das ‘Neujahrs’-Fest zur Jahresmitte und die Investitur des

in this ritual, see Frechette and Hrůša.356salāʾ mê, strengthened by its likely similar context in an additional royal ritual, 18
illuminates the way in which this prayer blended functionality typical of Akka-
dian shuilla-prayers with that of Kultmittelbeschwörungen. Nisaba’s presumed
influence over other gods is manifested in both respects. Like the
Kultmittelbeschwörungen, which included descriptions of the special qualities of
the objects addressed, 19 Nisaba 1 is directed to a material that is then manipu-
lated in a ritual. However, the words addressed to the maṣḫatu-flour do not de-
scribe its material qualities but rather name anthropomorphic characteristics of
the goddess, as do many shuilla-prayers; she is “merciful,” she “creates god,
king, and human,” she “reconciles angry gods to humans.” 20
The image of Nisaba as a “net” (saparru, line 3) capable of making angry de-
ities relent captures well the influence of this deity. A saparru is attested as being
spread out or thrown in order to capture and pacify an opposing deity. This im-
age provides a link between the anthropomorphic images of Nisaba and the ma-
terial manifestation of the goddess as flour, which, like such a net, is cast to-
wards the deity. The recital of Nisaba 1 in conjunction with ritual scattering of
maṣḫatu-flour as an offering would have manifested influence to calm angry dei-
ties. In Bīt salāʾ mê this ritual-prayer would have rendered Jupiter/Marduk,
widely attested as a furious warrior, calm and amenable to interceding for the
king in order to reconcile him with his personal gods. It begins there a lengthy
sequence of shuillas to the gods of Nippur and Babylon that continues through
the night intended to gain also their intercession on the king’s behalf. It is possi-
ble that at least some of the offerings in the subsequent lengthy sequence of
shuilla-rituals in Bīt salāʾ mê might also have included maṣḫatu-flour and, if so,
would have further manifested Nisaba’s influence.
18
Noting that the colophon to MS C identifies it with the royal ritual complex Bīt rimki, Cecil
Mullo-Weir argued that Nisaba 1 may be restored as initiating the lengthy sequence of shuillas in
one version of that complex (BBR 26+), where, as in Bīt salāʾ mê, it is followed immediately by a
shuilla to Marduk (“The Prayer Cycle in the Assyrian Ritual bît rimki, Tablet IV,” AfO 18 [1957–
1958], 371–72).

20
Moreover, in Bīt salāʾ mê, Nisaba 1 differs from the sequence of ten Kultmittelbeschwörungen
which immediately precede it in that none of them include instructions for the making of an
offering to the materials to which they are addressed. Yet, an offering is made to the maṣḫatu-
flour in conjunction with the recitation of Nisaba 1.

Line 1: ÉN in many cases marks the beginning of wording to be recited in rituals;
while it is often equated by scholars with šiptu, “incantation,” it is not clear that the scribes
read the word as Akkadian. They may have simply understood it as a Sumerian word. In
any case, it is not part of the prayer itself. d NISABA ( d ŠE . NAGA ; also read d NIDABA ) can signify
either a general term for grain or the goddess Nisaba. The NAGA sign originally depicted a
plant, possibly barley, and the ŠE sign may have originally represented a spike of grain.
Šarratu, “queen.” Ḫumālu is a rare term of uncertain meaning. Neither the CAD (Ḫ, 234)
nor Seux (339) offers a translation. Wolfram von Soden has suggested that behind this
term stands the Heb. (Canaanite) ‫ל‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫ח‬,
“to have compassion” (“Bemerkungen zu einigen
literarischen Texten in akkadischer Sprache aus Ugarit,” UF 1 [1969], 191). This view is
reflected in AHw, which glosses ḫumalīti as “freundliche”? (355a) but offers a correction,
glossing ḫumālu as “Mitleid [compassion]”? (1562a). The CDA reflects both possibilities,
glossing ḫumalīti as “friendly, sympathetic”? (120). Following Hrůša’s edition, the present
form is here taken as a denominative adjective (“merciful”) in a form referred to as “nisbe”
(the term is borrowed from Arabic grammar), in which -ī is added to the base of the noun
(see Huehnergard, §6.2; GAG, §56 q). The case vowel is i, rather than the expected u of the
nominative, but case endings in texts from the late period are often arbitrary.

“mankind, humanity.”

Line 3: Saparru, “net, throw-net.” This term is attested as a kind of (divine) weapon
which was “spread out” (šuparruru or tarāṣu) in order to capture and pacify a raging hos-
tile deity (see CAD S, 161; CAD Š/3, 317–18). Such use of a saparru is attributed to Nisaba,
e.g., saparru ša Nisaba liksûšu, “May Nisaba’s net ensnare him” (cited by CAD S, 161).
Hammurabi also describes himself as sapar nakirī “enemy-ensnaring throw-net” (Laws of
Hammurabi ii 68; Martha Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia Minor [2d ed.;
SBLWAW 6; Scholars Press: Atlanta, 1997], 78). Depicting Nisaba as a net for constraining
an opponent provides a significant link between words and ritual action. It not only corre-
sponds with the request in the present prayer that Nisaba pacify the speaker’s angry per-
sonal deities, it also mirrors the ritual activity of pouring or sprinkling of flour as a ritual
offering. The last two words in the line form a phrase in apposition to Anunnakkī. Anun-
nakkū is often left untranslated. In earlier Sum. texts the term referred to the gods, espe-358d

ze-ne-e: the case vowel â in MS A is an apparently erroneous accusative case; the case vow-
el ê in MS D reflects the Assyrian genitive ending –e (rather than the Babylonian –i). Ištaru,
“goddess.” While the Sumerogram d 15 may indicate the name of the goddess Ishtar, the
name of this divinity also became a general appellative for “goddess,” as in the typical
phrase “god and goddess.” Ze-ni-t[u 4 ]: Only MS A preserves the ending here, which errone-
ously indicates the case vowel u rather than the expected i.
musallimat ila zenâ ištara zenītu
Line 5: Šapāru, “to send.” The form is a 1cs precative with a 2fs pronominal suffix. Af-
ter the preposition ana the nouns and adjectives are all in the genitive; both nouns have
pronominal suffixes 1cs (indicated by MU ). Having described pertinent characteristics of
Nisaba in lines 1–4, the speaker now begins the petition using language echoing that de-
scription.
lušpurki ana ilīya zenî ištarīya zenīti
Line 6: Ša introduces a relative clause. While one might take the following two forms,
as well as zenû to be adjectives, they are more likely predicative constructions (statives)
with the subordination (or subjunctive) marker –u. Kamālu, “to be(come) angry, wrathful.”
Šabāsu, “to be angry, furious.” Libbu, “heart.” The –ma here, which occurs in only one of
the two preserved MSS , may serve as a conjunction or have an emphatic or topicalizing
function (see GAG §123a). Zenû, “to be angry.” KI = itti, “with.” KI . MU = ittīya, “with me.”
While these predicative constructions are single in agreement with the subject libbu, the
translation should reflect plurality: “whose hearts are wrathful, furious and angry.”
ša kamlu šabsu libbašunū-ma zenû ittīya
Line 7: Sullumu, see line 4. Sullimī is a D fs impv. plus ventive. The –ma is emphatic.
Of the four MSS preserving DINGIR here, only MS A adds MEŠ , and this need not indicate a
plural. Assyriologists generally recognize that in some nominal forms MEŠ has become a
frozen form; thus, Borger notes that in nominal forms, MEŠ may be meaningless (MZL, no.
754, 420). Since u may serve as the case vowel for the accusative as well as the nomina-
tive in SB, and seeing that of the four terms requiring an accusative ending in this line,𒌋𒌋 A S HUILLA : N ISABA 1

8–13, an insertion comprised of a sequence of formulas found only in MS A, see the discus-
sion under T HE P RAYER . Self-presentation formulas, such as that in lines 8–9, may function
as an independent clause or as a subject for what follows (see Mayer, UFBG, 46–52).

Line 9: Ša introduces a relative clause. Marduk (= d AMAR . UTU ), the ruling god of Bab-
ylon, and his spouse Zarpanitu are here named as the personal god and goddess of Sha-
mash-shum-ukin, the Babylonian king.

Line 10: Ina, “as a result of.” ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, misfortune, calamity.” Á . MEŠ = idāti
and GISKIM . MEŠ = ittāti are often taken as alternate gen. fp forms of ittu, “omen, ominous
sign.” However, the two terms, although identical in semantic range, represent two differ-
ent bases itta- and idat- (see CAD I/J, 309–10). For a detailed linguistic and conceptual
treatment of ittu as Omenanzeiger [omen-announcer] and idātu as “die (fein)materiell
gedachte ‘Abstrahlung’ des Omenanzeigers [the (subtly) tangible ‘radiation’ of the omen-
announcer],” see Maul, ZB, 6–7. ḪUL = lemnu, “inauspicious, ill-boding, dangerous.” NU =
lā, “not.” DÙG . GA = ṭābu, “auspicious, favorable.” The syntax of this line is clear, but its
meaning depends on one’s understanding of how omens operated. Lumun is in construct
with idāti and ittāti, and the adjectives lemnēti lā ṭābāti may be taken to modify ittāti or both
idāti and ittāti. Stefan Maul takes both the adjectives in this phrase, which occurs frequent-
ly in namburbis, as modifying both nouns: “Die bösen, unguten idātu und ittātu [The evil,
no-good idātu and ittātu]” (ZB, 6 n.41). Seux’s translation of the line inserts an implied
verb and a relative pronoun: “[Quant au mal] (qu’annoncent) les signes et les présages
mauvais, défavorables” (340). Thus, Seux takes the construct chain lumun idāti ittāti to
imply, “the evil that the signs and evil, unfavorable portents announce.” Mayer also as-
sumes that signs and portents announce evil, but his translation does not represent the
Akkadian syntax literally, taking lemnēti lā ṭābāti as what is being announced: “bei/wegen
dem Übel von Vorzeichen und Anzeichen, die Schlechtes und Unheil (verkünden) [because
of the evil of the signs and portents, (which announce) something bad and disaster]”
(UFBG, 103). While Seux and Mayer agree that in the Mesopotamian worldview omens
announce events, Maul clarifies that omens there “announce” not only by indicating a por-
tended event, but by activating it in a concrete way (ZB, 5).

Line 11: Ša introduces a relative clause whose antecedent is idāti ittāti. É . GAL = ekallu,
“palace.” KUR = mātu, “land.” GÁL . MEŠ = bašû, “to occur.” While the MEŠ sign in verbal
logograms can signify the plural or an iterative stem (Borger, MZL, no. 754, 420), the pre-
sent normalization is based on the syllabic spelling ib-šá-a-ma in the parallel formula in
Nergal 2 discussed in the introduction to the prayer (see Mayer, UFBG, 480, Text G: 15′).
The text following the line is restored after a formula occurring in that same parallel text
(see discussion under T HE P RAYER ). Palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am anxious (palāḫu), I
am afraid (adāru), and I am panicked (Št adāru).” All three forms are 1cs predicative con-
structions (statives). For this formulary, see also Mayer, UFBG, 73.
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ / 〈palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku〉
Line 12: The pronominal suffix on lumnu, BI = –šina, refers back to idāti ittāti. Note
that the n of the noun assimilates to the š of the suffix. Ayyâši, “towards me,” is a form of
the 1cs dative pronoun to which the preposition ana has assimilated (ayyâši < ana yâši, cf.
GAG, §41 j 2). IA-ši is taken here as ayyâši since the É . G [ AL -ia] which follows it demands
the preposition ana (see Mayer, UFBG, 267). For the possibility of reading IA as ay(y)V, see
Werner Mayer, “Besonderheiten in der Verwendung des Graphems A . A im Akkadischen,”
Or n.s. 72 (2003), 293–306, at 305–6. While the translation given below may be read am-
biguously, it is important to recognize that the prepositional phrase, “towards me and my
palace,” modifies the series of verbs in the following line, not the subject, “their evil.”

Line 13: TE = ṭeḫû, “to come near to, to approach.” DIM 4 = sanāqu, “to check, to ap-
proach, to come near.” KU . NU = qerēbu, “to approach, to come close to.” KUR = kašādu, “to
reach, to arrive, to conquer.” All of these verbs are vetitives (prefix ayy– plus the preter-
ite), that is, negative commands.

Line 16: Paṭāru is a G inf. here, meaning “releasing” (thus, “absolution”). It is bound
to the following noun, eʾiltīya. These two words form a genitive (construct) chain, which is
the object of the following verb. Naqbû (N of qabû), “to be spoken, commanded.” In pray-
ers, the request that the deity “speak” or “command” what the speaker desires reflects the
view that the divine word was effective for determining events (see Mayer, UFBG, 297–
306). The remainder of this line is not well preserved in any of the textual witnesses. The
reading šumu (= MU ), “name, repute, fame,” is possible but uncertain because of missing
context. The presence of šumka could indicate that the second half of this line begins the
typical element of the promise of praise. While šumu is not well attested in typical phrases
in the context of a “promise to praise,” Mayer identifies the expression šuma ullulu in this
context, interpreting it, “to let the name shine brightly” (UFBG, 340).

Line 17: Narbû, “great deeds,” pl. of narbû “greatness.” This form may be read as sin-
gular or plural. Regarding its occurrence in the context of the “promise to praise” in pray-
ers, while CAD interprets it as the singular “greatness” (CAD N/1, 351), both Mayer
(UFBG, 320) and Maul (ZB, 418/420, line 20) take it as a plural meaning “great deeds.” MS
D has dalīl (the bound form of dalīlu, “praise”). Ilūtu, “divine power, divine nature, divine
rank.” Kayyān, the adverbial form of kayyānu, means “constantly, regularly.” Šūpû (Š of

tive.

for manû is u in the OB period, in SB it often changes to i. IGI = maḫru. Ana maḫar, “before

flour used almost exclusively for ritual offerings (see Milano, “Mehl,” 25). As discussed
earlier, the instructions for the recitation of this same prayer within the royal ritual Bīt362salāʾ mê indicate that an offering was to be made in front of the maṣḫatu flour before the
prayer was recited.
ana maḫar maṣḫati immanni
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
In light of the function of this ritual-prayer to Nisaba, who is manifested
both mythically as an influential goddess who makes angry deities relent and
concretely in the maṣḫatu-flour employed within the ritual, I begin these com-
parative suggestions with a discussion of grain and grain offerings in the Bible.
In the agrarian societies of the ancient Near East, grain was the fundamental
building block of the economy and the main medium of taxation. 1 In Mesopota-
mia, grain was the most important among human foods and among ritual food
offerings for the gods; it was offered in the form of bread, cereal products, por-
ridge, and flour. 2 As flour, it was typically scattered (sarāqu) either upon a cen-
ser or upon the burnt animal offering and could be mixed with other ingredients
such as water or oil before being poured. 3 Among libations, beer made from bar-
ley or emmer-wheat was very common.
While the Mesopotamians identified grain with Nisaba, the Bible depicts
Yahweh as responsible for providing it. Deuteronomy identifies abundance of
grain as among the blessings assured by Yahweh in response to covenant loyalty
(Deut 7:13) and the lack of grain resulting in the people’s destruction as among
the curses for covenant infidelity (Deut 28:51). Psalm 65:9–13 offers a lyric de-
scription of the Israelite god’s intimate involvement in bringing forth an abun-
dant harvest of grain. The Bible also portrays grain as an offering given to the
deity. In the Priestly material of the Pentateuch, the term ‫ה‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ְ‫נ‬ ‫מ‬ ִ , which otherwise
in BH may simply signify “gift,” specifies “cereal offering.” 4 Leviticus 2:1–16 and
6:7–11 describe an array of cereal offerings, all of which combine fine flour
(‫ת‬ ‫ֹל‬ ֶ ‫ס‬ ) and oil but contain no leaven; they may take the shape of unleavened
cakes or wafers and may be baked or cooked on a griddle or in a pan. A portion
of each is “turned into smoke” (hiphil of ‫)קטר‬ with frankincense as an offering to
Yahweh, and the remainder of each is then given to the priests. Thus, in the
Priestly material as in Mesopotamia, and in particular as we may understand
offerings accompanying Nisaba 1, various forms of food made from flour were
offered ritually by burning. While the Priestly material specifies cooking or bak-
ing of these foods prior to offering them, the Mesopotamian sources allow for
offering flour, perhaps mixed with oil or water, directly.

The explicit purpose of Nisaba 1 in conjunction with grain offerings as an
appeal for help in calming angry gods finds only indirect parallels in the story of
Noah and in the sacrificial system of the Priestly writings.
In the Priestly system, if sacrifices and offerings to Yahweh can be said to
have a pacifying function, it is with an emphasis on their capacity to please the
deity rather than on the necessity of calming divine anger. Many biblical narra-
tives and prayers acknowledge Yahweh’s anger, but the use of offerings to calm
this anger is not addressed in the Priestly sacrificial system. While sinful acts
may have been presumed to anger the deity, sin offerings are not explicitly
characterized as calming divine anger.
More specifically, one view of Leviticus 1–3 supports the possibility that the
grain offerings described in Leviticus 2 might have been applied in a variety of
situations, including times of distress which could well have been attributed to
divine anger. In both Mesopotamian and biblical sources, cereal offerings are
inexpensive, and even the poorest worshipers can make them. Prayers to Sha-
mash and Marduk specify maṣḫatu flour as what the widow offers to the god. 5
Baruch Schwartz considers that Leviticus 1–3 is a unified divine speech pertain-
ing to gift offerings (‫ה‬ ‫שּׁ‬ ֶ ‫)א‬,
which are distinct from expiatory offerings in that
they allowed the worshiper to offer Yahweh a token of reverence on various
occasions, including: fulfillment of vows, visits to the sanctuary, supplication in
times of distress, and gratitude. 6 Schwartz also suggests that Leviticus 2 was
placed between the two major categories of such offerings (whole burnt offer-
ings in Leviticus 1 and sacrifices of well-being in Leviticus 3) precisely to affirm
that even the poorest Israelite could make a gift offering. 7 The Priestly material
also allows that for a purification offering, someone too poor to afford either a
sheep or two turtledoves may offer a portion of choice flour ( ‫ת‬ ‫ֹל‬ ֶ ‫ס‬ , Lev 5:11).
In the story of Noah, although the text does not explicitly use terms for “an-
ger” to describe the deity’s attitude in sending the flood, such a destructive act
in the ancient Near Eastern context presumes anger (Gen 6–7). The sacrifice
offered by Noah after the flood is pleasing to Yahweh and clearly implies a paci-
fication of divine anger (Gen 8:20–22). While animals rather than grain are of-
fered there, a gradation of offerings allowing for more affordable commodities
such as grain may be assumed in the sacrificial system presumed by this story.
The evidence from Mesopotamia and from the Priestly writings just discussed
supports such a presumption.

The Jewish Study Bible, 208–9.364Line 17 of Nisaba 1 concludes with the speaker’s offer to proclaim the god-
dess’s great achievements, an offer that fits the form often described as a con-
cluding “promise/vow of praise.” In the ancient Near East praise was conceived
primarily as public narration, likely accompanied by celebration, in which the
speaker attested to specific experiences of divine favor by which the deity had
confirmed his or her responsiveness and power. 8 This conception is reflected in
the Hebrew Bible. Biblical scholars classify roughly a third of the biblical psalms
as having a literary form known as the individual lament, whose description has
been heavily influenced by the structure of incantation-prayers (see page 61).
Like incantation-prayers, the individual lament follows petition with a vow of
praise. However, among the biblical psalms, such a structure rarely occurs in a
simple linear way. In Psalm 9:14–15, for example, the speaker’s petition for
mercy is followed by a promise to praise the deity in public: 9 “so that I may re-
count all your praises, and, in the gates of daughter Zion, rejoice in your deliv-
erance.” Yet, verse twenty of the same psalm voices another petition: “Rise up, O
L ORD ! Do not let mortals prevail.”
8
See, e.g., the poem Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, especially the opening hymn (page 483) and Tablet IV.
Both the verb used here (‫ספר‬ piel, “to recount”) and the location of the speaker suggest a pub-
lic performance.

T HE P RAYER :
While not completely consistent, those textual witnesses to the prayer that
preserve a rubric refer to our prayer in Sumerian as ka-inim-ma šu-íl-lá d utu-
kam, “the wording of a shuilla to Shamash.” 1 Several witnesses show interesting
variations within the text of the prayer. 2 For example, two versions of the peti-
tion suggest differing emphases. In several MSS , the self-introduction and the
lament are missing. This leaves the prayer with little motivation beyond the
general desire for a good life. The unnamed supplicant seeks a life filled with
positive portents. But the longer versions of the prayer, namely, MSS D 8ʹ–11ʹ, G
19–26, and I 17–22, which differ among themselves, contain a self-introduction
and a lament and are therefore more specific in their concern. Particularly in MS
G, the supplicant, perhaps a king, 3 is concerned with bad omens that cause him
to be continually anxious. The difference in emphasis of the prayer is accom-

There is evidence that supplicants recited Shamash 1 in a variety of ritual
contexts. Claus Ambos places Shamash 1, particularly as exemplified in MS A
(along with the other rituals and prayers on the same tablet) in the ritual series
Bīt salāʾ mê (“Water-sprinkling house”). 5 MSS α, β and γ quote the incipit, that is,
the first few words of Shamash 1, in their ritual instructions. MS α is likely also a

A, B, F and I. MS K reads šu-íl-lá d utu-ke 4 .
See Mayer, UFBG, 503 for the textual witnesses. I follow his sigla.

In MS G the supplicant is an unknown Aplutu; MS D reads in this place anāku annanna mar
annanna, “I am so-and-so, son of so-and-so,” the most common place holder in prayers; and MS I
reads, Šamaš-šum-ukīn, the seventh century king of Babylon. In the present treatment of the text,
lines 18–25 of the text, notes, and translation represent the major addition in MS G.

367368Bīt salāʾ mê (“Water-sprinkling house”) ritual. 6 MS β is a collection of medical
rituals and incantations. 7 It references several incantations, including ours, only
by way of their incipits. Of these, scholars have only identified our prayer with
relative certainty. 8 While superficially the whole of MS γ is identifiable as a nam-
burbi collection, the MS actually includes a mixture of ritual types. 9 For this
reason, it is not clear that MS γ is itself a witness to a namburbi context for our
prayer. 10 In any case, it is clear that some version of our prayer was used in both
Bīt salāʾ mê and various medical rituals.
The prayer has three major sections: a long invocation, an extended peti-
tion, and a rather short conditional call for praise.
A detailed structure of the prayer is as follows:
I) Invocation
A) God’s name, honorific titles and attributes (1–6)
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (7–17)
II) Petition
A) Self-introduction (18–19) (missing in the shorter versions)
B) Lament (20–25) (missing in the shorter versions)
C) Plea (25–43)
III) Final, conditional call for praise of the god (43–47)
A lengthy invocation begins with a set of traditional honorific epithets be-
fore calling on Shamash by name. The last of these involve the bringing of hap-
piness to the people and setting them free. These set the stage for mention of the
various skills that the god will need to meet the supplicant’s petition. The invo-
cation continues with additional honorific titles and transitions to a praise of
specific and special skills of Shamash. These skills, providing a lone man with a
friend, giving an heir to the impotent, etc., continue the theme of Shamash being
a provider of happiness and freedom to the people. The invocation ends with
praise of Shamash’s actions as judge of the gods and as one who gives judgment

Compare Mayer’s suggestion that MSS A and α are mīs pî rituals (UFBG, 503).
The incipit referencing our prayer is at BAM 322:64. See Mayer, UFBG, 503. On the composite
nature of this witness see Franz Köcher, Die babylonisch-assyrische Medizin in Texten und Unter-
suchungen (6 vols; Berlin: de Gruyter, 1962–1980), IV.ix–x and 322. F. A. M. Wiggermann, Meso-
potamian Protective Spirits: The Ritual Texts (Groningen: Styx, 1992), 126 notes a possible associa-
tion between our prayer and those mentioned in BAM 332 that use the epithet ur.sag, Akk.
qarrādu, “hero,” for example at line 64. Other examples include BAM 3:28ʹ–32ʹ, also a medical
text, and KAR 253, rev. 8. The exact nature of this relationship if any is unclear.

Of MS γ Maul writes, “The basis for the combination of such diverse rituals as in KAR 72 will
probably always remain unclear” (“Der Grund für die Kombination von so unterschiedlichen
Ritualen wie in der Tafel KAR n72 wird wohl für immer unklar bleiben”; ZB, 175). And in note
162 on the same page he says, “The purpose of the first ritual (KAR 72, obv. 1–25) is unclear”
(“Der Zweck des ersten Ritual [KAR n72 Vs, 1–25] ist unklar”). KAR 72:24 is our MS γ. On the
multiple ritual contexts of our prayer see also Mayer, UFBG, 19–20.

to humankind by way of haruspicy, “on the exta of a sheep you inscribe the
omen; you place judgment.”
This praise of Shamash as judge provides not only an end of the invocation
but an introduction to the petition. Aplutu, the supplicant of MS G, first formally
introduces himself and then laments, “the sting of the flesh (omen) has befallen
me.” This directly ties to the previous reference to Shamash’s role in giving
judgment by haruspicy. But as the lament unfolds, we quickly learn that there
are other evil signs, broken chariot parts, red ants in the house, and other un-
named evil omens, that befall the supplicant. The lament ends with the stock
phrase, palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am afraid, anxious, and constantly in
fear.” The shorter versions of this prayer lack both the self-introduction and la-
ment. The plea proper asks Shamash, in his role as judge, to “decree” 11 favorable
portents, including good dreams and good fortune. To some extent, the final
three lines read as a continuation of the plea. But based on the rather set pat-
terns in such prayers, I think there can be little doubt that this section is condi-
tional. Unlike many other such conditional endings, these lines in our prayer are
the supplicant’s request that Shamash be praised rather than the more common
conditional vow that the supplicant himself will praise the god. 12
One might analyze the last section of this shuilla-prayer as an apodosis to its
plea’s protasis and understand it as the closing element of the petition. 13 While
the final section does serve such a function, it also harks back to the invocation
and creates, with the invocation, an inclusio for the whole prayer. The supplicant
enumerates many praiseworthy attributes of the god in the invocation. The ful-
fillment of the petition adds yet another praiseworthy element to Shamash’s
resumé. In this way, the final conditional section ties the invocation and the
petition together. For this reason, I think it best to consider the final section on
the same level as the invocation and petition.

Studies in Memory of William L. Moran (ed. Agustinus Gianto; Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute,

Mayer lists the ending of our prayer among a group of conclusions to prayers that he charac-
terizes as follows: “A short praise formula is integrated into the petition, and thus does not have
the character of a concluding promise or wish of praise” (“Eine kurze Lobformel ist in die Bitten
integriert, hat also nicht den Charakter eines abschliessenden Lobversprechen oder -wunsches”;
UFBG, 347; emphasis original). This group makes up one of three under his more general head-
ing of “Petitions involving the promise of praise, or wish of praise” (“Bitten nach dem Lobver-
sprechen bzw. Lobwunsch”; see UFBG, 347–48). Abusch, “Promise,” 6, also notes the existence
of deviations in the way shuilla-prayers end.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording.” This marks the beginning of the
wording of the prayer. It is not actually part of the prayer itself. Šurbû, “exalted, supreme,”
is often used to describe deities and their epithets (see CAD Š/3, 341–42). The Š stem ver-
bal adjective is used here as an elative (i.e., superlative), “most exalted.” Gitmālu, “perfect,
ideal.” Aplu, “son, heir.” d AŠ . ÍM . BABBAR = Namraṣīt, an epithet for Sin, the lunar deity. The
prayer begins with several lines of stock epithets to Shamash or minor variants on such
stock epithets. Despite the fact that the prayer does not use Shamash’s name until line 3,
there can be no doubt that the prayer is addressed to him.
šiptu: surbû gitmālu apil Namraṣīt
Line 2: ZÁLAG = nūru, “light,” is on occasion an appellative for Shamash. Eddēššû,
“constantly self-renewing.” Based on the participle in the following clause, the form of
petû, “to open,” is best understood as a ms participle (pētû). The participle is bound to the
following noun; therefore, we expect pēti. But in SB Akkadian a participle from a III-weak
root in construct with a following substantive often ends with –û (see Brigitte R. M.
Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der jungbabylonischen „hymnischen“ Literatur, 2
Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 14/1–2; Stuttgart: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1987],
1.95). UN . MEŠ = nišū, “people.” The idiom pān nišī petû, “to open the peoples’ face,” means
“to bring happiness” (see CAD P, 351). Nūra kullumu, “to show someone the light,” implies
setting someone free from prison. Note the PN Šamaš-nūra-kullimanni, “O Shamash, set me
free!” See CAD K, 524–25. Participial description dominates in this line and the next.
nūru eddēššû pētû pān nišī mukallim nūra
Line 3: d UTU = Šamaš. Muštēšir from šutēšuru (Št lex. of ešēru), “to put in order, to
clear up, to provide justice.” The form is a ms participle (bound form). LÚ . ÚŠ = mītu, “dead
person.” LÚ . TI = balāṭu, “living person.” Barû, “to see.” Participles from III-weak roots
sometimes lack the final short vowel; it is preserved in MSS E and F. Kalû (bound: kal[a]),
“all, every.” The idiom mimma šumšu, lit. “whatever its name,” means “anything, every-
thing” (see CAD M/2, 75–76). Shamash can provide justice for all people, living and dead,𒌋𒌋𒁹 A S HUILLA : S HAMASH 1

šamê u erṣetim with ilī, “of the gods.” KUR = mātu, “land, country.” KUR . KUR = mātāti (pl. of
mātu). Note the doubling of the sign to indicate a plural noun. Šarūru, “radiance.”
Šamaš nūr šamê u erṣetim šarūr mātāti
Line 5: EN = bēlu, “lord.” Ṣulūlu, literally “canopy, covering,” is a common metaphor
of divine or royal protection (see CAD Ṣ, 243). É-babbar-ra = E-babbar, the Sumerian
name of Shamash’s temple at Sippar. See A. C. V. M. Bongenaar, The Neo-Babylonian Ebab-
bar Temple at Sippar: Its Administration and Its Prosopography (Leiden: Nederlands Histor-
isch-Archaeologisch Instituut, 1997).

Line 7: This line is missing from MSS B, C, I, K. Upaqqā is a 3fp durative from puqqu,
“to pay attention to,” attested only in the D stem. Tenīštu (tenēštu), “humankind.” Rather
than continuing with the list of epithets, lines 7ff. use finite verbs in complete sentences to
describe Shamash. Lines 7–9 use verbs in the third person; those in lines 10–15 are second
person.
ana nūrīka upaqqā tenīšētum
Line 8: Qibītu, “speech, command.” Utaqqû (Dt of [w]aqû), “to wait attentively on
someone or something, to attend.” Mayer’s MS F reads the verb as upaqqā instead, mirror-
ing the previous line. DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Generally, the Igigi-gods are the lesser or
younger gods in the pantheon but, on occasion, the name seems to imply the whole pan-
theon. Mayer’s MS F reads GAL . MEŠ = rabûtu, “the great ones,” in place of DINGIR . MEŠ . Occa-
sionally, rabûtu is an epithet for the Igigî (see CAD R, 35).

Line 9: UN . MEŠ , see line 2. DAGAL . MEŠ = rapšāti, fp of rapšu, “wide, far-flung.” N išī
rapšāti, is a common idiom for widespread peoples (see CAD R, 164). Ṣalmu, “black.”
SAG . DU = qaqqadu, “head.” The idiom ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “the black-headed ones,” refers to
humankind. They are like sheep led by their divine shepherds. Mayer’s MS G reads the
beginning of the line differently: ilu u šarru nišī ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “god and king, the black-
headed people.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Qurdu, “heroism,” in the plural means “heroic deeds.”
nišī rapšāti ṣalmāt qaqqadi idallalā qurdīka
Line 10: GURUŠ = eṭlu, “young man, youth.” AŠ (also read DILI ) = ēdu, “single, indi-
vidual.” See eṭlu ēdu, “single/lone man,” in CAD E, 36, 37, 409, and CAD T, 188. (Mayer,
505 reads the logogram as KAL DILI , but this does not change the meaning.) Tappû, “part-
ner, friend, companion.” Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause to acquire, to provide.” Description of
Shamash with second person verbs begins in this line and continues through line 15.
eṭla ēda tappâ tušarši
Line 11: Here lā is used proclitically to negate the following noun. CAD I/J, 226 un-
derstands lā išari as an idiom for “impotent” based on išaru, “normal” or “straight” rather
than išaru, “penis.” See also Seux, 284, n.11 and AHw, 392. Tanamdin (for tanaddin) is
from nadānu, “to give.” The –dd– often changes to –nd– or –md–, as here. See GAG, §32b,c.
One might expect apla instead of aplu but the nominative case ending often stands for the
accusative in SB Akkadian. See GAG, §63e. Note that MS D reads ap-li here, apparently
understanding the word as a plural (aplī).
ana lā išari tanamdin apla
Line 12: Edlu, “locked.” Sikkūru, “bolt, bar.” Given the plural adj., this noun should be
taken as a plural, too. Puttû (D of petû), “to open, to unlock.”
edlūti sikkūr šamê tupatti
Line 13: Lā nāṭili is a common expression, based on the adj. nāṭilu, “seeing.” Compare
ana lā išari in line 11. See CAD N/2, 129. In some contexts, nūra šakānu can be understood
idiomatically to mean “to provide joy” (see CAD N/2, 349). But here a more literal under-
standing is called for. Again, the nominative case vowel appears in place of the accusative
(i.e., on the object of the verb): nūru for nūra. The light of Shamash can penetrate the
darkness of a blind person.

Line 14: Ṭuppu, “tablet.” Armu, “enclosed.” A ṭuppu armu is a tablet with its envelope,
an encased tablet. Lā petû, “un-opened.” Šasû, “to shout out, to read aloud.” This verb is
often used with tablets or inscriptions; see CAD Š/2, 162–63. Shamash sees everything (see
line 3), even the contents of a tablet inside its clay envelope.
ṭuppa arma lā petâ tašassi
Line 15: Libbu literally means “heart” but can also refer to the exta (i.e., the insides)
of an animal. UDU . NÍTA = immeru, “sheep.” Šaṭāru, “to write, to inscribe.” UZU . MEŠ = šīru,
“meat, flesh,” here means an ominous sign (see CAD Š/3, 121–22). One should take in-
scribing the šīru as marking it with abnormalities so that the exta, primarily the liver but
also other organs including lungs, indicate some omen. Extispicy was a common practice
in Mesopotamia and elsewhere. Šakānu, “to put, to place.” Dīnu, “judgment.” The last two
words are added in MSS C and G; they clarify the judicial meaning of “writing omens.” MS
G also adds the following line between our lines 15 and 16: [Š]amaš muštēšir māti bēl šīmāti
gišḫurāte a[ttā-ma], “O Shamash, who sets the land in order, you are the lord of the fates
(and) plans.” Compare MSS D and F in line 17.
ina libbi immeri tašaṭṭar šīra tašakkan dīna
Line 16: Dayyānu, “judge.” Igigî is in synonymous parallelism with ilī.
dayyān ilī bēl Igigî
Line 17: Šīmtu, “fate, destiny.” Mayer’s MSS G and I vary slightly here. MS G has: [bēlu ?
m]ušīm šīmāt mātāti attā-[ma ? ], “O lord, you are the one who determines the fates of the
lands.” MS I: Šam[aš] bēl mušīm šīmāti attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the lord who deter-
mines the fates.” Mayer’s MSS D and F offer more significant variation. They replace the
text we have labeled line 17 with something else. MS D has: [Šamaš] bēl šīmāti gišḫurāte
attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the lord of the fates (and) plans.” MS F: Šamaš muštēš[ir]
mātāti attā / bēl šīmāti gišḫurāte attā-ma, “O Shamash, you are the one who sets the lands in
order, you are the lord of the fates (and) plans.”
Šamaš bēl šīmat māti attā-ma
Line 18: Three witnesses, Mayer’s MSS F, G, and I, add four, eight, and six lines re-
spectively after line 17. These all offer variations on stock self-presentation and lamenta-
tion formulas. Lines 18 to 25 follow MS G (translated by Mayer in UFBG, 510). Similar lines
are found in MS I but they name Shamash-shum-ukin, king of Babylon c. 650 BCE , as the
supplicant (translated by von Soden, 319). MS D’s supplement is generic, using common
placeholders for the supplicant’s name. The variations in and rearrangements of textual
material evidenced here and in the last several lines are quite typical for Mesopotamian374

prayers and incantations. Consulting a critical edition is absolutely necessary to work
through this material properly (see UFBG, 506–7). IBILA -u-tú = Aplūtu, literally “sonship,”
is the proper name of an individual from Ḫuzirina (modern Sultantepe).
anāku Aplūtu mār ilīšu
Line 19: This line completes a common self-presentation formula, “I am PN 1 , son of
PN 2 , whose god is DN 1 and whose goddess is DN 2 .” d 30 = Sîn. d NIN . GAL = Nikkal, Sin’s
consort. d 15 = ištaru, here alongside ilu, means “goddess.”
ša ilšu Sîn ištaršu Nikkal
Line 20: Siḫiltu, “pricking, sting.” GAR = naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed, to be
set in place, to occur” (see CAD Š/3, 156). A passive form is required by context, either an
N stem preterite, iššaknam, or a predicative, šaknam; as expected, the form is accompanied
by the 1cs dat. suffix, –am (see UFBG, 91). Compare the first part of the line with the fol-
lowing: siḫilti šīri ana bīti šuāti iššakkan, “siḫilti šīri will befall that house” (CAD S, 235,
citing CT 38 47:41). This “sting of the flesh” is a negative portent resulting from hepato-
mancy (i.e., liver divination). The enclitic –ma connects the two halves of the line. The
second MA sign, represented as «ma» above, is a scribal dittography. UŠ . UŠ = riteddû (Gtn
of redû), “to drive constantly, to pursue constantly.” The doubling of the logogram is one
way scribes indicated an iterative stem like the Gtn. The –ni on the verb indicates a 1cs
pronominal object suffix. This line begins the supplicant’s lament, that is, why he is ap-
pealing to the deity for help.
siḫilti šīri šaknam-ma irteneddanni
Line 21: Here ina, in expressions like ina lumun, is causative or instrumental, meaning
“because of,” “by means of,” or “on account of.” ḪUL = lumnu, “evil (omen).” The words
that follow lumun (bound form of lumnu) in the next several lines indicate the sign of the
evil omen that perplexes the supplicant. GIŠ . GIGIR = narkabtu, “chariot.” MU is the logo-
gram for a 1cs pronominal suffix. A ḫuṣāb narkabti is a wooden part of the chariot that can
be broken by a horse (see CAD Ḫ, 258). Šebēru, “to break.” The verb ends with the sub-
junctive marker, –u, because it occurs in a relative clause (headed by ša). Particular omens
in this line and the next have caused the supplicant distress.
ina lumun mimma ḫuṣāb narkabtīya ša iššebru
Line 22: kulbābu, “ant.” SA 5 . MEŠ = sāmūti from sāmu, “red.” The MEŠ indicates the plu-
ral form of the adj. É = bītu, “house.” IGI -ru = nanmuru (N of amāru), “to be seen, to oc-
cur.” Like iššebru in the previous line, the form of this verb is 3cs preterite with subjunc-
tive. Several Akkadian omens mention ants and red ants in particular in their protasis. For
example, “If (a man has dug a well within his house and) red ants (kulbābū sāmūtu) have𒌋𒌋𒁹 A S HUILLA : S HAMASH 1

line and the next form a common lament formula (see UFBG, 101–2). This formula serves
as a basis for the textual reconstruction. The lament moves now to a very general and
vague lament about untoward omens the supplicant has experienced. Its generality permits
coverage of everything the supplicant—any supplicant—might be worried about.

Line 24: GÁL . MEŠ = bašû, “to be.” IGI = pānu. GIB (or GIL ). MEŠ = parāku, “to lay across,
to block, to obstruct.” When used with ana pāni, the verb means “to oppose, to confront”
(see CAD P, 156–57).

Line 25: All the verbs in this line are 1cs predicatives. Palāḫu, “to fear, to be afraid.”
Adāru, “to be afraid (of), to fear.” Šutādurāku is a Št 1cs predicative (from adāru). It means
“I am constantly in fear.” See CAD A/1, 109 for a discussion of šutādurāku and related
words.

er, to decree.” Alaktu, “way, route.” Dummuqu (D of damāqu), “to improve, to make favor-
able, pleasant.” Note the imperatives, which are common in petitions.
šīmtī šīm alaktī dummiq
Line 27: Ešēru, “to go well, to be straight.” With omens, the verb means “to be favor-
able.” The form is a 3fp precative. Idātu, see line 23, here with 1cs suffix. This line and the
next belong together (see UFBG, 507). The linguistic parallelism is very tight.

Line 29: Šunat is the bound form of šuttu; it introduces here a dependent clause.
Naṭālu, “to see.” SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqti (f), damqāti (fp), “good, favorable,” pl. “good
news, good luck.” The word is probably to be understood as a plural, damqāti. But one
could read damiqti with about the same meaning. The choice between damqāti and damiqti
is in large measure a matter of convention. See CAD D, 67. Šukna is an impv. from šakānu
plus 1cs dative suffix. MS F reads terre, a ms impv. from turru (D of târu), which with ana,
means “to turn something into something.”
šunat aṭṭula ana damqāti šukna
Line 30: Išariš, “normally, correctly.” Alāku, “to walk, to go.” Išariš lullik is an idiom
for “let me prosper” or “let me have a good life” (see CAD I/J, 223). Lukšud “to reach, to
achieve, to accomplish.” Tappû, “friend, comrade.”
išariš lullik tappê lukšud
Line 31: The relative pronoun ša here means, “with reference to.” Ša ūmīya, should
likely be understood as an idiom for “during my life,” not unlike the English idioms “all
my days” or “in my day.” The particle lū, among other uses, expresses a wish in a verbless
sentence. It is related to the precative. Notice the connection here with line 29 above and
line 32 below via SIG 5 .
ša ūmīya lū damqāti
Line 32: Šutlumu, “to grant, to bestow generously.” The form is a ms impv. plus 1cs
pronominal suffix. INIM . GAR = egirrû can mean “reputation,” but it also means “ominous
utterance.” The reader should be mindful of the ambiguity in this lexeme. Several texts
associate egirrû and dreams. For example, “the šunātim and igirrê which I saw and heard”
(CAD E, 45, citing A 7705:13; see further Sally A. L. Butler, Mesopotamian Concepts of
Dreams and Dream Ritual [AOAT 258; Münster: Ugarit-Verlag, 1998], 151–57). Here the
context favors “portents,” perhaps “spoken portents,” over the far less specific “reputa-
tion.” SIG 5 = dumqu, “goodness, good, welfare.” Egirrê dumqi is a common expression for
good (spoken) omens.
šutlimam-ma egirrê dumqi
Line 33: SILA = sūqu, “street.” Ina sūqi is a common idiom for “publicly.” Magir is the
3ms predicative of magāru, “to consent, to agree.” In the predicative the verb means “to be
agreeable, to find favor, to be acceptable.” Qabû, “to speak.” The form is an infinitive plus
1cs pronominal suffix. Conceptually speaking, perhaps one might understand this and the
following lines against the contrasting context of Ludlul I 73–98.

Line 34: MSS F and G add two lines here (our lines 34–35). LUGAL = šarru, “king.”
Šūquru (Š of aqāru), “to hold in esteem, to give honor.” Note that gods and kings are cited
as a class to themselves, a class above the kabtu u rubû of the next line.
ilu u šarru lišāqirūʾinni
Line 35: IDIM = kabtu, “politically influential person.” NUN = rubû, “prince or noble
person.” Kabtu u rubû can refer to a person or a god. Texts often pair these two words.
Epēšu, “to do, to make.” Given the plural subject, we expect līpušū rather than the singular
līpuš. In light of the previous line, note the following: kabtum u rabûm mamman ša lā
ušaqqaranni ul ibašši, “there is no influential person or official who does not hold me in
esteem” (see CAD K, 27, citing TLB 4 22:29).
kabtu u rubû ša qabîya līpuš
Line 36: Ulṣu, “pleasure, rejoicing.” Rīštu, “rejoicing, celebration.” Ina ulṣi u rīšāti is a
very common expression referring to all the joys of life without its difficulties. (W)abālu,
“to bring, to carry,” but with ūmu as its object, “to pass time” (see CAD A/1, 20).
ina ulṣi u rīšāti lubil ūmu
Line 37: Kittu, “truth,” commonly deified as here (note the determinative). Kittu and
Mishar (see next line) are children of Shamash, which is appropriate given the fact that he
is the god of justice. Izuzzu (uzuzzu), “to stand.” ZAG = imittu, “right side.”
Kittu lizziz ina imittīya
Line 38: GÙB = šumēlu, “left side.” Mīšaru, “justice.”
Mīšar lizziz ina šumēlīya
Line 39: Atalluku (Gtn of alāku), “to walk, to go constantly.” The Gtn here is used to
indicate persistence of protection. Mušallimu is a participle from šullumu (D of šalāmu), “to
keep well, to give well-being, to heal,” functioning as an adjective. Á = idu, “arm, side.”
littallak ilu mušallimu ina idīya
Line 40: a-a = ayy–, indicates the vetitive, a negative wish. Naparkû, “to cease, to
stop doing.” Ipparku is the 3cs preterite of this quadriradical root; with ayy–, the form is a
vetitive. MAŠKIM = rābiṣu, a person or being (demon/protective genius) with authority to37841. li-ta-mu-ka d bu-ne-ne

Line 41: Atmû (Gt of amû [awûm]), “to speak.” The preterite (and therefore the preca-
tive) can be either ītamu (so MSS G and K) or ītami (so MS A); see CAD A/2, 86. Bunene, a
son and sometimes sukkallu of Shamash, as here, is frequently associated with Kittu and
Mishar. SUKKAL = sukkallu (šukkallu) is a court official. In some places, Elam, for example,
a sukkallu was a ruler. For other references to Bunene as the sukkallu of Shamash, see CAD
S, 359. In light of the verb, the “good thing” in this line (damiqti) is probably a good word.
lītamūka Bunene sukkalka damiqti
Line 42: d a-a, Aya, the consort of Shamash. Ḫīrtu, “wife.” Narāmtu, “beloved (wom-
an).” Šilim is a ms impv. from šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, well, at peace.”
Aya ḫīrtu narāmtaka šilim liqbīka
Line 43: Ašarēdu (ašaridu), “first in rank, foremost.” Rašû, “to acquire, to get.” Rišâ is
a ms impv. Rēmu “mercy, compassion.” On the expression rišâ rēmu and its variants, see
UFBG, 225. After this line MS F inserts [i]lu libbaka liṭīb k[abatt]aka li[ppašir], “May the god
satisfy your heart, may your mind (lit. liver) be released” (see UFBG, 509, n.129(1)). Seux
offers a somewhat different reading and reconstruction of this additional line (see 285,
n.33). Compare this addition with line 46 below, which provides a very close parallel and
is missing in MS F. Shamash is invoked one final time in superlative terms, as in the open-
ing line, before the final petition for mercy.
Šamaš ašarēd ilī attā rišâ rēmu
Line 44: This line and the following two comprise the short conditional call for the
gods to praise Shamash. This line harks back to line 4, where Shamash is called nūr šamê u
erṣetim, “the light of heaven and earth.” Ḫadû, “to rejoice (in/over).” Râšu, “to rejoice
(in/over).” On the extremely common parallel between ḫadû and râšu, see CAD Ḫ, 26 and
R, 211.

Line 45: Kiššatu, “totality, world.” The expression ilū ša kiššati likely refers to the

in the form of praise, frequently come from the gods.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The Hebrew Bible occasionally applies solar imagery to Yahweh that is simi-
lar to that applied to Shamash himself. Ps 84:12, for example, refers to Yahweh
as “a sun and a shield” ( ‫ים‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ן‬ ֵ‫ג‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫וּ‬ ‫שׁ‬ ‫מ‬ ֶ ‫שׁ‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ). In Isa 10:17 he is called ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ‫אוֹ‬ ,
“light of Israel.” Solar imagery is particularly clear in Isa 60:2–3, ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫ח‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ְ‫ז‬ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ְך‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ַ ‫ע‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ,
“but upon you Yahweh will shine,” and ‫ְך‬ ‫ח‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ַ‫ז‬ ‫הּ‬ ַ‫ג‬ ‫נ‬ ֹ ְ‫ל‬ ‫ים‬ ‫כ‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ָ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫וּ‬ ‫ְך‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫אוֹ‬ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫גוֹ‬ ‫כוּ‬ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ , “and na-
tions will walk by your light and kings by your shining radiance.” The passage
shows a strong semantic equivalence to the imagery used in lines 2 and 4 of our
prayer. On the other hand, in Ezek 8:16, idolatrous temple worshipers are said
to be “bowing low to (towards) the sun in the east” ( ‫שׁ‬ ‫מ‬ ֶ ‫שּׁ‬ ֽ ָ ‫ל‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫ד‬ ְ ‫ק‬ ֵ ‫ם‬ ‫ית‬ ֶ ִ‫ו‬ ‫ח‬ ֲ ‫תּ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ‫מּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ֵ ְ‫ו‬ ).
Taken together, the cited passages approve solar imagery when applied to Yah-
weh but condemn the worship of the sun. 1
Line 16 refers to Shamash as “judge of the gods, lord of the Igigi.” It is in
this role that the supplicant calls upon him. 2 The Hebrew Bible uses the ‘Judge’
epithet for Yahweh and often portrays him in the role of judge. Ps 94:2, for ex-
ample, invokes the deity’s judicial role, ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ט‬ ‫פ‬ ֵ ֹ ‫שׁ‬ ‫א‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ִ , “rise up, O judge of the
earth.” Using an imperative rather than a noun, Ps 82:8 demands that Yahweh
exercise this role actively, ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ‫ט‬ ָ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ‫קוּמ‬,
“rise up, O God, judge the
earth!” (Notice the use of ‫א‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֵ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ִ in Ps 94:2 may reflect solar imagery, though
marshal imagery cannot be ruled out.) Gen 18:25 makes a similar reference in
question form: ‫ט‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ‫שׂ‬ ֶ ‫יַע‬
‫לֹא‬ ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ל־ה‬
‫כּ‬ ָ ‫ט‬ ‫ֹפ‬ ֵ ‫שּׁ‬ ‫ה‬ ֲ , “Shall the judge of the earth not do
1
See Mark S. Smith, “The Near Eastern Background of Solar Language for Yahweh,” JBL 109
(1990), 29–39 for a more exhaustive list of examples. Compare Ben Sira 50:7 with Ezek 8:16 and
Kuntillet Ajrud inscription 8:1, wbzrḥ [ ] ʾl with Isa 60:2–3. 2 Kgs 23:11 includes a type of solar
imagery, a chariot, not seen in our prayer but used with reference to Shamash in other contexts.
However, line 30 mentions Bunene, Shamash’s chariot driver. See also the apparent solar rite in
Job 31:26–28, where a lunar image is also involved.
2
Other prayers to Shamash further developed his role as judge (see Shamash 73:22–28, for
example, page 206).380justice?” In Ps 7, a psalm permeated with judicial imagery, 3 Yahweh judges the
people (‫ים‬ ‫מּ‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫ין‬ ‫ד‬ ִ ָ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫;י‬ v 2). In Isa 2:4 Yahweh will judge among the nations. The
supplicant of Ps 26:1 asks Yahweh “judge me!” ( ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ט‬ ֵ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ; see likewise Ps 7:9). Here
and elsewhere ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ט‬ ֵ ‫פ‬ ְ ‫שׁ‬ ָ is sometimes translated “vindicate me” because the suppli-
cant surely expects that he or she will be vindicated via Yahweh’s judgment.
Although the references could be multiplied, these clearly show that Yahweh
exercised a similar divine role in Israel as Shamash did in Mesopotamia. But an
interesting contrast comes up in a survey of biblical texts related to Yahweh’s
judicial role. On the one hand, Yahweh, unlike Shamash, who is the judge of the
gods, calls the gods to assemble to judge his people (Ps 50:4–5, where “heavens”
and “earth” seem to stand for divine beings). On the other hand, in Ps 82:1,
while Yahweh stands in the divine assembly (‫ים‬ ‫ֹלה‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫ב‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ק‬ ֶ ‫)בּ‬
and gives judgment,
the psalmist (Ps 82:2) thinks this activity is perverse (‫ל‬ ֶ‫ו‬ ‫)ע‬.
Rather than judging
the cases of the divine beings, the psalmist implores Yahweh to judge the cases
of the wretched, the orphan, the lowly, and the poor.
Lines 44–46 in our prayer find noteworthy parallels in the Hebrew Bible.
For example, these lines are thematically comparable to Deut 32:43 LXX ,
προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες υἱοὶ θεοῦ (parallel to ἄγγελοι θεοῦ), “let all the divine
sons do obeisance to him” (NETS), which is reflected in the text of 4QDeut q
32:43 (4Q44 Frag. 5ii): ‫אלהים‬ ‫כל‬ ‫לו‬ ‫השתחוו‬, “worship him all you gods.” 4 And Ps
96:11a illustrates a very similar motif to šamû liḫdūka erṣetim lirīška of line 44. It
reads: ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ‫ג‬ ֵ ‫ת‬ ָ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ם‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫חוּ‬ ‫מ‬ ְ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ , “let the heavens rejoice and the earth exult.” The
juxtaposition of “heavens” and “earth” as seen in this parallel is a common de-
vice in Biblical Hebrew and in many Akkadian texts. 5
While it is possible to make too much of it, we might also note the thematic
similarities between bringing sight, “light,” to the blind in line 13 and Yahweh’s
ability to restore sight as mentioned, for example, in Isa 35:5, ‫ים‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫י‬ ֵ‫ינ‬ ‫ע‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫ח‬ ְ ‫ק‬ ַ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫תּ‬,
“the eyes of the blind will be opened,” and Isa 61:1c (Old Greek), καὶ τυφλοῖς
ἀνάβλεψιν, “and recovery of sight to the blind.” 6 The preceding context of the
Isaiah 61 passage includes bringing good news to the poor, binding up the bro-

kenhearted, and freeing the captives. It seems that both Yahweh and Shamash
can restore sight to the figuratively or physically blind.
In his ability to read encased tablets, Shamash can free their contents from
the darkness of their enclosure. A similar idea is found in Isa 29:11–12, which
uses ‫ם‬ ‫תוּ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ֶ ‫ר‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ‫סּ‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ַ , “the sealed book/scroll,” as a metaphor for prophecy. Yahweh
surely knows the contents of the sealed document, for he is the source of proph-
ecy. Note, however, that Hebrew ‫ם‬ ‫תוּ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ and Akkadian armu have but limited over-
lap in their semantic ranges. ‫ם‬ ‫תוּ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ is from ‫חתם‬, “to affix a seal,” or, as in Isa
29:11–12 and elsewhere, “to shut up, to close,” while Akkadian armu is from
arāmu, “to cover, to stretch or place something over something else in order to
cover it.”
The emotion, if not the language expressing it, reflected in the stock phrase
palḫāku adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am afraid, anxious, and constantly in fear,” in
the context of an ominous dream, is similar to the report of Pharaoh’s dream in
Gen 41:8, ‫חוֹ‬ ‫רוּ‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ע‬ ֶ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫תּ‬ ִ ַ‫ו‬ , “his spirit was upset,” and the comparable report from
Nebuchadnezzar in Dan 2:1 ( ‫חוֹ‬ ‫רוּ‬ ‫ם‬ ‫ע‬ ֶ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ת‬ ְ ‫תּ‬ ִ ַ‫ו‬ ). But whatever parallel there might be
between the Akkadian and biblical passages is weakened by the frequent use of
the Akkadian phrase in many contexts that do not involve dreams. Using even
more semantically distant language, Dan 5:6 also reflects the dread of an evil
omen, ‫ן‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֽ ָ ‫ֽ ק‬ ְ ‫נ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫א‬ ‫דּ‬ ָ ‫הּ‬ ‫ת‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ָ ‫כ‬ ֻ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫א‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ן‬ ִ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫הּ‬ ‫צ‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫ט‬ ְ ‫ק‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬ ‫הּ‬ ֵ‫לוּנּ‬ ‫ה‬ ֲ ‫ב‬ ַ ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫ֹה‬ ִ ‫עיֹנ‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫י‬ ‫נוֹה‬

A Shuilla: Sin 1
A LAN L ENZI
S IN :
Sin (Akk. Suʾen > Sîn; Sum. Nanna) was the Babylonian god of the moon
and a high god in the Mesopotamian pantheon. He was the firstborn son of Enlil
and Ninlil, conceived during their illicit relationship described in the myth bear-
ing their names. Sin’s consort was Nikkal (Sum. d Nin-gal). He was the father of
Shamash and Ishtar, along with a few lesser known deities.
Sin’s major cultic center was in Ur (at the temple É-kiš-nu-gál), but he was
honored with a temple or shrine in a number of other Mesopotamian cities, in-
cluding Babylon, Nippur, Ashur, and Uruk. Evidence for his worship appears in
some of the earliest cuneiform documents and suggests a pre-historic origin.
Sin’s cult is also known from the Syrian town of Harran. Although already at-
tested at the site in the early second millennium, Sin’s cult flourished at Harran
in the first millennium (at the temple É-ḫul-ḫul, “house that gives joy”), benefit-
ting significantly from Nabonidus’ infamous zeal for the deity. 1 (Nabonidus’
mother was a high priestess of Sin at Harran, and he installed a daughter as
priestess to Sin in Ur.)
The moon god was responsible for regulating the month, reflecting the Mes-
opotamian use of a lunar calendar. According to the opening lines of the astro-
logical series Enūma Anu Enlil this fate was determined for Sin by Anu, Enlil, and
Ea. 2 Within the same work we see the great oracular significance the Mesopota-
mians attributed to the appearance of the moon. In fact, the first twenty-two
tablets of the divinatory series are given over to the moon. (There were seventy

Worship of Sin continued at Harran as late as the eleventh century of our era. See Tamara M.
Green, The City of the Moon God: Religious Traditions of Harran (Religions in the Graeco-Roman
World 114; Leiden: Brill, 1992) for the religious history of the city, including an interesting
account of how the polytheistic moon-worshippers of Harran navigated (and survived) the Islam-
ic conquest by claiming to be the Sabians mentioned in the Quran (2.62, 5.69, 22.17).

moon’s first crescent (tāmarāti ša Sîn), and tablets 15–22 deal with the middle of
the month, the potential time for a lunar eclipse. 4 This background informs lines
18–19 of our prayer.
Sin was represented in iconography by a number of symbols, the most im-
portant of which is the recumbent crescent moon. This symbol is sometimes un-
derstood as the horns of a bull, the animal associated with Sin (see the incanta-
tory text A Cow of Sin 5 ), or a boat. In keeping with his calendrical duties, Sin’s
divine number was 30.
A few biblical names show Sin as their theophoric element: Sennacherib
(Heb. ‫יב‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ח‬ ֵ ְ‫נ‬ ‫;ס‬
Akk. Sîn-aḫḫē-erība, “Sin has replaced the brothers”), Sanballat
(Heb. ‫ט‬ ‫לּ‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ַ ְ‫נ‬ ‫;ס‬
Akk. Sîn-uballiṭ, “Sin has brought back to life”), and Shenazzar
(Heb. ‫ר‬ ‫צּ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ַ ְ‫נ‬ ‫;שׁ‬
Akk. Sîn-uṣur, “O Sin, protect!”). 6
T HE P RAYER :
The most recent edition of this prayer lists nine MSS that preserve parts of
the prayer and/or ritual instructions. This MS tradition shows significant textual
diversity, which must be related to the fact that the prayer was used in the Bīt
rimki ritual series (actually noted by Butler’s MS A) as well as in a namburbi to
dispel the evil of a lunar eclipse. 7 For the sake of illustration, a few examples of
this textual variation follow. MSS A 1 and B 1 include an attalû formula in its ver-
sion of the prayer between our lines 12 and 16 while MSS C 1 and F 1 , the other
two MSS attesting this part of the prayer, do not. 8 MS F 1 does, however, make an
addition in its place: it contains a self-presentation formula that names Ashurba-
nipal as the supplicant of the prayer. In contrast to this identification, MSS A and
B name Shamash-shum-ukin in our line 22 of the prayer as the supplicant. MS C 1 ,
though leaving out the attalû formula, presents a fuller text of the prayer in oth-
er places, with additions after our lines 8, 16 (several lines), and 26.

The present text is deliberately eclectic, including material that we deem useful
for readers trying to acquire familiarity with shuillas. This pedagogical text cannot
replace consultation of the critical edition.
Our shuilla begins with an invocation and a very lengthy hymnic introduc-
tion in lines 1–20 (minus lines 13–15, for which see below). Lines 21–22 create
a transition between the opening hymn and the petition section of the prayer,
which occurs in lines 23–34. The prayer ends in line 35 with a very brief prom-
ise of praise. 9
The structure of the long opening hymn deserves closer attention. It consists
of two parts: lines 1–8 treat Sin’s light-bearing qualities—eternal divine attrib-
utes—in relation to temporal beneficiaries, the people; lines 9–20 focus on his
authority and revelatory powers among the gods.
The hymn introduces the deity with an invocation and a couple of tradi-
tional epithets that set out Sin’s position among the gods (line 1). The following
couplet uses participial phrases (in lines 2b and 3a) to show Sin, “the perpetual-
ly renewing one” (line 2a), actively dispelling darkness and bringing forth light
for the benefit of the people (line 3b). In lines 4–7, predicative verbal construc-
tions and nouns with 2ms pronominal suffixes are used to depict Sin’s radiance,
again a timeless characteristic of the deity; but this depiction is clearly framed
by references to those who benefit from it—the people (line 4a) and the wide
earth (line 7b). Line 8 marks the end of the first half of the hymn with a report
of the people’s positive reaction to the deity.
Line 9 begins the second half of the hymn by re-invoking Sin as Anu, the
high god, and asserting his inscrutable knowledge. The following couplet (lines
10–11) makes lexical connections back to lines 5a (ṣētu) and 6b (kīma DN) and
uses predicative verbal constructions and nouns with 2ms pronominal suffixes,
as did lines 4–7; despite reprising Sin’s radiance, the couplet’s purpose is to es-
tablish Sin’s high position and esteem among the gods. Lines 12, 16–17 advance
the idea of lines 10–11 while also picking up on the theme announced in line 9.
Sin presides over the divine assembly, answers the queries of other gods, and
teaches them at his feet. In short, he is sagacious and worthy of exaltation
among their ranks. Lines 18–19 focus this idea further. The query of the gods is
revelatory (thus secret) and related to Sin’s calendrical function; he alone deter-
mines the length of the month, which had hemerological and astrological impli-
cations. Line 20 concludes the hymn in a manner that conceptually recalls line 8
(see the notes on the latter line below): people celebrate Sin’s divinity.
If ēmūq lā šanān in line 21 is a comment on ašarēdu in line 1, then line 21
summarizes both parts of the hymn by explaining or repeating the second half of
their introductory lines (1b and 9b). In any case, this line moves the prayer from
praise (lines 1–20) to petition (lines 23–34) via the self-presentation formula
that follows it in line 22 (in two MSS ).
9
My interpretation is based on an eclectic text. Individual MSS vary. See the critical edition and
the notes below. For example, the self-presentation in line 22 only occurs in two MSS .388The petition section of the prayer is carefully structured to move the deity
to respond to the supplicant’s petitions. The section begins in lines 23–24 with a
description of (prior) ritual actions performed for the deity’s benefit. These lead
naturally into lines 25–27 in which the supplicant explicitly calls on the deity to
act on their behalf. Both of these sections prepare the deity to heed the suppli-
cant’s petitions, which come in three groups (lines 28, 30–31, and 33–34). Line
28 contains the first and most general petition: the supplicant wants a favorable
oracle (note the imperative verb). Line 29 then establishes the supplicant’s need
(using a verb that is neither an imperative nor precative) in what we may identi-
fy as the prayer’s only complaint: the supplicant’s personal deities are angry
with them. Using three precative verbs, the next two lines (30–31) present the
supplicant’s petitions for Sin to heal this strained relationship. Line 32 establish-
es the supplicant’s course of action (using a verb that is neither an imperative
nor precative): the supplicant has commissioned Anzagar, the dream god, to
intervene on their behalf with Sin. The next two lines (33–34), using three prec-
ative verbs, contain the petitions related to what the supplicant hopes the dream
god can do for them: forgive their sin and restore them to well-being.
According to my analysis of this eclectic version of the prayer, the text is
well-structured to persuade the deity to respond to the supplicant. One may well
wonder, therefore, why and for what purpose lines 13–15, the so-called attalû
formula, was inserted into this prayer (attested in two MSS , Butler’s A 1 and B 1 ). I
believe the answer is fairly straight forward. First, the attalû formula concerns
the evil of a lunar eclipse, a matter that is directly related to Sin, the moon god.
Second, lines 12, 16–17, and 18–19 thematically establish Sin’s authority among
the gods and his revelatory knowledge with regard to celestial matters. The sec-
ond part of the hymn therefore seems to be an appropriate context to address
Sin about the problem of the eclipse. Finally, line 12 mentions “the decision of
the land,” which, when followed by the attalû formula, takes on that formula’s
clearly defined concern. Furthermore, line 16 describes the gods inquiring of Sin
for his judgment on the matter. The insertion of the formula between these two
lines, therefore, attempts to turn what was a rather general statement about Sin’s
standing and decision making among the gods into the specific concern of re-
solving the issue of the eclipse. If this interpretation is correct, the insertion of
the attalû formula here was a clever scribal intervention.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “ritual wording, incantation.” This word marks the beginning of
the prayer on the tablet. It is not a part of the prayer itself. d 30 is Sin’s symbolic number.

NANNA -ru = nannāru, “light of the sky, moon.” Šūpû, “resplendent, manifest, brilliant,
famous.” SAG . KAL = ašarēdu (ašaridu), “leader, foremost.” DINGIR . MEŠ = ilū, “gods.” Ašarēd
ilī is a very common title for various deities in prayers (see CAD A/2, 417). It is not specif-
ic to Sin.
šiptu: Sîn nannāru šūpû ašarēd ilī
Line 2: Given the lunar cycle, eddeššû (also eddēšû), “perpetually self-renewing,” is an
appropriate epithet for the moon god. The word may be taken as an attributive adjective,
modifying the deity’s name, or it may be taken substantively. Line 1 commends the latter
option. Nummuru (D of namāru), “to make bright, to illuminate.” Uklu, “darkness.” Obvi-
ously, the moon is the brightest light in the night sky.
Sîn eddeššû munammir ukli
Line 3: Šakānu, “to put, to place, to provide.” Namirtu, “light, brightness.” UN . MEŠ =
nišū, “people.” Apâtu, “numerous, teeming,” is often used to describe people. It can also be
used alone in the sense of “humanity.” The positions of the participles in lines 2b and 3a
form a grammatical chiasm while the following genitives (ukli vs. namirti) contrast with
one another semantically.
šākin namirti ana nišī apâti
Line 4: This line takes up where line 3 left off: with the people, the beneficiaries of
Sin’s work. SAG . DU = qaqqadu, “head.” Ṣalmāt qaqqadi, “black-headed ones,” is a common
designation for the people of ancient Mesopotamia. It derives from the application of ideas
about shepherding to the social structure. The king is a shepherd and the people sheep.
The fact that the sheep in Mesopotamia had black heads and the people had dark hair may
have suggested the specific designation. Uššuru (D of ašāru), “to release, to send forth.”
Šarūru, “brilliance, ray.” The text describes Sin’s radiance here and in the next three lines,
without mentioning his active role in providing light (as in the previous two). Notice the
use of predicative constructions and nouns with a 2ms pronominal suffix attached.

Line 5: Namrat is a 3fs predicative from namāru, “to be(come) bright, to shine.”
= ṣētu, “light, shining appearance.” Although ṣētu is very close to the word ṣītu (log-
ogram È = signs UD-DU), “exit, rising” (see Foster, 760, Seux, 278, and von Soden, 316),
the latter is generally used of the sun’s rising, not the moon’s (but see the celestial epithet
in line 21). AN = šamû, “heaven.” Ellu, “pure, clear, bright” (= KÙ in line 26). The restora-
tion follows Ebeling, AGH, 6, adopted by Butler (382).
namrat ṣētka ina šamê ellūti
UD . DA
Line 6: Šarḫu, “proud, magnificent, splendid.” The adjective is a predicative (3fs); see
also lines 5 and 8. Dipāru, “torch.” We expect the suffixed form of the nom./acc. noun to
be dipārka, but dipāra- with a suffix is attested elsewhere (see CAD D, 156, citing BRM 4
50:20). GIM = kīma, “like, as.” d BIL . GI = Girra, the fire god (see page 145). Ḫimṭu, “burn-
ing, scorching.” The restoration follows Mayer’s suggestion (UFBG, 491). The lexical
choices in this line support the Girra simile.
šarḫat dipāraka kīma Girra ḫimiṭka
Line 7: Malû, “to fill.” The verb is a transitive parsāku construction, which is identical
in form to a predicative but is transitive, i.e., it takes an object (erṣetu). Namrirrū, “awe-
inspiring luminosity,” is usually plural. One might compare it to the word melammu, “radi-
ance, awe-inspiring sheen” (see CAD M/2, 9–12 and the lexical and bilingual sections of
the namrirrū entry in the CAD [N/1, 237]). KI = erṣetu, “earth.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu
(f), “wide.” Erṣetu rapaštu is a common phrase for referring to the whole world.
malû namrirrūka erṣeta rapašta
Line 8: The previous four lines have expatiated upon Sin’s radiance. This line reports
the reaction of those who have benefited from it (see line 4a and 7b). Šarḫa (see line 6
above) is an adverbial accusative of manner, modifying the line’s verb. Gutaššuru (Dt of
gašāru), “to vie with one another.” This is the only instance of this stem of the verb with
this meaning (see CAD G, 56). When the first letter of a root is g, the infixed –t– usually
changes to a –d–. Amāru, “to see.” Kâta, “you” (acc.). Although the text has mentioned
people already (lines 3–4), here people take an active role in the prayer. They jostle about
as if in a crowd to catch a glimpse of Sin. Perhaps we are to imagine people watching a
religious procession, straining to see the divine image as it passes by. Butler’s MS C 1 adds a
(broken) line here (see 283, line 8a), which may shed some light on the present line: [ ]
ana ilūtīka upaqqū kayyāna, “. . . to your divinity they are attentive (puqqu) constantly.”

Line 9: Sin is invoked as d Anum, the sky god, the high god of the Mesopotamian pan-
theon. The prayer is (rhetorically) exalting Sin, for purposes of praise, to the highest place
in the pantheon. The ša here is possessive, “whose,” anticipating the referent of the pro-
nominal suffix on milku. Lamādu, “to learn.” Milku, “counsel, advice.” Mamman, “some-
body, nobody,” is an indeclinable indefinite pronoun. The second half of the line changes
the direction of the hymn; in fact, it introduces its last half. The inscrutability of the gods
is a common theme (see also page 267). Its function in a hymnic setting like this, besides
the obvious idea of praise, is to contrast the supplicant’s helplessness with the deity’s pow-
er. The supplicant recognizes and confesses (implicitly) reliance upon the deity’s benevo-
lent knowledge.
Anum šamê ša lā ilammadu milikšu mammam
Line 10: Šūturu, “supreme, very great,” is a 3fs predicative. d UTU = Šamaš, the sun
god and god of justice. Bukru, “son.” Shamash is Sin’s son. This line somewhat parallels the
first half of line 5 and the second of line 6. The moon god’s shining appearance (ṣētu) is
likened to Shamash, the sun! Even if this is doxological hyperbole, the attempt to elevate
Sin is clear.
šūturat ṣētka kīma Šamaš bukrīka
Line 11: Kamāsu, “to kneel.” Maḫru, is a substantive meaning, “front, presence,” but
can also function as a prepositional phrase, (ina) maḫar–, “before, in front of.” GAL . MEŠ =
rabûtu, “great” (pl). The elevation of Sin continues. The great gods submit themselves,
which is the meaning of the kneeling gesture, to his authority. For the purposes of this
prayer, Sin is the most important, authoritative deity.
kamsū maḫarka ilū rabûtu
Line 12: EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision, verdict.” KUR = mātu, “land.” The reduplicated
logogram indicates plurality. GAR = šakānu, “to put, to place, to establish.” But the context
requires a passive, thus an N stem: naškunu, “to be set, to be established.” IGI = maḫru,
“front,” or pānu, “face.” The former is preferred by Mayer (UFBG, 175–76). Ina maḫrīka
means “in front of you.” The gods are not the only ones that submit to his authority; he
decides the cases of the land, too. In both lines 11 and 12 the submitters do so in front of,
that is, in the presence of the deity.
purussû mātāti šakin ina maḫrīka
Line 13: Lines 13–15 above are Butler’s lines 12–13 from her MSS A 1 and B 1 . These
lines preserve the attalû formula, a kind of lament. The fact that line 16 resumes the
themes of lines 11 and 12 (and the tone of praise) suggests the formula was secondarily392

inserted into these MSS . Butler’s MS C 1 in fact proves that in at least one version of the
prayer our line 12 is continued by line 16 (it lacks the formula). Butler’s MS F 1 , also inter-
vening between our lines 12 and 16, deviates from all of these other MSS by naming Ash-
urbanipal here in a self-presentation formula while leaving out the attalû lines (see 384,
lines 13a–13c; note also our line 22 below, preserved in line 19a of Butler’s MSS A and b, in
which Ashurbanipal’s brother, Shamash-shum-ukin, is named as the supplicant). All of this
textual data indicates how shuillas could be tailored to a particular occasion for a specific
individual. To sort through this properly, one must consult the critical edition. ḪUL = lum-
nu, “evil.” AN . GE 6 = antalû, attalû, “eclipse.” The following d 30 indicates this is a lunar
eclipse. ITI = arḫu, “month.” NENNI = annanna is a place holder; here it stands for any
month name or, following UD , day of the month. UD = ūmu, “day.” GAR = šakānu, general-
ly means “to put, to place, to establish” (see line 12 above), but here it means “to occur.”
The present case calls for a passive verb, thus we should read the logogram as an N stem,
iššakna, with the ventive.
ina lumun attalî Sin ša ina arḫi annanna ūmi annanna iššakna
Line 14: Á . MEŠ = idātu and GISKIM . MEŠ = ittātu. For the relationship of the two logo-
grams to ittu, see CAD I/J, 304–10, especially 309–10; note also Maul’s distinctive under-
standing of the words, discussed on pages 359 and 409 of the present volume. NU DÙG = lā
ṭābu, “not good, unfavorable.”
lumun idāti ittāti lemnēti lā ṭābāti
Line 15: É . GAL = ekallu, “palace.” MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. GÁL = bašû, “to be, to
exist.” The fact that both palace and land are mentioned together rather strongly suggests
the attalû formula was reserved for prayers involving the king, the one who ensures securi-
ty and stability throughout the kingdom.
ša ina ekallīya u mātīya ibšâ
Line 16: Šalû, “to ask, to inquire.” SUM = nadānu, “to give.” The logogram should be
understood as a 2ms durative here and in line 18 (see Butler’s MS C 1 on p. 385). For milku,
see line 9. Resuming the theme of lines 11 and 12, the text again highlights Sin’s reputa-
tion for counsel and continues its expansive opening section of praise. After this line, But-
ler’s MS C 1 offers a fragmentary, deviating text for several lines (see 385–86 and Mayer,
UFBG, 492, n. 14[3]).
ilū rabûtu išallûkā-ma tanaddin milka
Line 17: Ašābu (wašābum), “to sit, to dwell.” The verb ušbū is a 3mp preterite, but it
may be better to emend it to read ašbū (see Seux, 279, n.19), a 3mp predicative. Puḫru,
“assembly.” The singular noun is an adverbial accusative of place (not the subject of the
verb, which is plural). Šutāmû (Št of amû [awûm]), “to discuss, to consider.” The object of
the verb is probably an understood milku from the previous line. If we accept the emenda-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : S IN 1

tion at the beginning of the line, this verb should probably be read as a durative. KI . TA =
šaplu can mean “underside, bottom,” but here, with ina and the 2ms pronominal suffix, it
means “at your feet.” This line develops the idea of line 16 by means of a concrete image:
the divine council sits at Sin’s feet as students sit at the feet of their schoolmaster. Again,
Sin is exalted to the head of the pantheon. On the divine council in Mesopotamia, see Alan
Lenzi, Secrecy and the Gods: Secret Knowledge in Ancient Mesopotamia and Biblical Israel
(SAAS 19; Helsinki: The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project, 2008), 27–66.
ašbū puḫuršunu uštammû ina šaplīka
Line 18: The opening invocation is nearly repeated; the remainder of the line is an
adaptation of line 16. É-kur is the Sum. name of Enlil’s temple in Nippur, often associated
with the location of the divine assembly of Mesopotamian deities. Tāmītu (also tāwītum),
“(oracular) question and/or response” (see CAD T, 123–24). For preserved texts of tamitu-
prayers, see page 49. W. G. Lambert discusses the present passage within the context of
celestial divination in his Babylonian Oracle Questions (Mesopotamian Civilizations 13;
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2007), 6. The unspecified “they” in our line must be the great
gods or divine assembly of lines 16–17.
Sîn šūpû ša E-kur išallûkā-ma tāmīt ilī rabûti
Line 19: UD . NÁ . ÀM = bibbulu (bubbulu), “new moon, the day of disappearance of the
moon.” Tāmittu stands here for tāmītu (see line 18). Pirištu, “secret,” stands in apposition to
tāmītu, thereby expressing the common idea that divine revelation is secret—inaccessible
to humans. Butler’s MS C 1 varies here, describing bibbulu as ūm purussê ša ilī rabûti, “the day
of the (oracular) decision of the great gods” (see 385, line 17). This variant speaks against
reading tāmittu as tašīltu, “celebration, delight, splendor,” as some have done (see, e.g.,
Seux, 279; the sign for MIT and ŠIL are very similar). For the revelatory significance of the
new moon as described here, see Lenzi, Secrecy and the Gods, 165–66, n.145.
bibbulu ūm tāmittīka pirišti ilī rabûti
Line 20: UD . 30 . KÁM means “the 30 th day.” The Akkadian for this logogram is uncer-
tain. Isinnu, “feast day, festival.” Tašīltu, “joy, delight, festiveness, celebration.” DINGIR -ti =
ilūtu, “divinity.” Butler’s MS C 1 adds two fragmentary lines here (see 386, lines 18a–18b).
UD . 30 . KÁM isinnaka ūm tašīlti ilūtīka
Line 21: d AŠ . IM 5 . BABBAR = Namraṣīt, an epithet for Sin, which means something like
“Radiant Rising One.” Ēmūqu, “force, strength.” Lā šanān, “unrivaled, without equal.” This
epithet may be picking up on ašarēdu in line 1. The last half of the line repeats line 9b. It
seems the line has attempted to summarize the two parts of the foregoing hymn. It func-
tions as a transition from praise to petition, the next section of the prayer.

lished the name”), king of Babylon from 667–648 BCE and the brother of the great Assyrian
king Ashurbanipal. Shamash-shum-ukin waged a civil war for four years against his broth-
er in Nineveh. ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.”
anāku Šamaš-šum-ukīn aradka
Line 23: Sarāqu, “to sprinkle, to pour, to strew.” Širqu (also sirqu, serqu), literally,
“sprinkling,” but generally refers to an offering of strewn flour. Note this word is a cognate
accusative of the verb. Mūšu, “night.” Ellu, “pure, clean,” conceptually must refer to the
offering, širqu, rather than the night. In lines 23–24 the supplicant describes the ritual
actions they perform. These are similar but not identical to the actual instructions attested
on some of the textual witnesses, which vary among themselves. If the actions in lines 23–
24 were performed, it is likely they were done before the reciting of the prayer (see Mayer,
UFBG, 208–9).
asruqka širiq mūši ella
Line 24: Naqû, “to pour out, to libate.” Šikaru, “beer.” SAG = rēštû, “first, pre-
eminent.” Šikaru rēštû designates first-rate beer, a very common item to libate (see CAD
Š/2, 426). Dašpu, “honey.” Compare the use of honey here with that in the ritual instruc-
tions in line 38.
aqqīka rēštâ šikara dašpa
Line 25: GIŠ . GÁN . LAGAB ? is obscure. Quddušu, “purified, consecrated.” Šumu, “name.”
Zakāru, “to name, to invoke.” After reminding the deity of the ritual actions already per-
formed, the supplicant makes their appeal in lines 25–27 for the god’s attention, what
Mayer calls the “turning” (Hinwendung) part of the prayer (UFBG, 122–45). The verbs are
probably best taken as performative utterances, the speaking of which executes the ritual
action. One might translate these “I hereby do X.” These lines lead up to the petitions
proper in lines 28ff.

line 5 for the vocabulary in the rest of the line. (Butler’s MS C 1 adds a line after this one,
see 387.) Grammatically speaking, the elements of lines 25–26 are arranged chiastically:

Line 27: For kamāsu, see line 11. Izuzzu, “to stand.” Šeʾû, “to seek.” Kâšu, “you.” The
verbs that open the line describe the bodily gestures that are attendant to the supplicant’s
seeking of the deity. These gestures are commonly associated with prayer. It may be signif-
icant to note that just as the gods kneel before Sin so too does the supplicant. The last verb
is a preterite and should be understood as a performative (see Mayer, UFBG, 170).
kamsāku azzaz ašēʾ kâša
Line 28: INIM . GAR = egerrû, “reputation, mood, ominous utterance, kledon” (see CAD
E, 43–45). Dumqu, “good, good fortune.” Mīšaru, “justice.” The first three words are literal-
ly translated, “an oracle of good fortune and justice,” but the genitives are best translated
adjectivally. UGU = eli, “on, onto, to.” Šukun is a G imperative of šakānu, for which see line
13. With line 28 the prayer moves into a petitionary mode, asking first for a propitious and
just oracular utterance.
egerrê dumqi u mīšari šukun elīya
Line 29: MU = 1cs pronominal suffix. d IŠ 8 . DAR .< MU > = ištartī, “my goddess.” The
transcription < > indicates that the scribe mistakenly omitted the MU sign. Ištu, “from.”
Maʾdu (mādu), “numerous, many.” Despite the u case vowel, one should understand this
word as a genitive, matching the case of ūmī, the noun it modifies. Sabāsu (more common-
ly šabāsu), “to be angry.” In this line and the next, the supplicant seeks reconciliation with
their angry personal deities, who apparently have been estranged from the supplicant for
quite some time. For personal deities, see page 431.
ilī u ištarī ša ištu ūmī maʾdūtu isbusu elīya
Line 30: Kittu, “truth.” Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace, to reconcile.” KI =itti, “with.”
Kittu and mīšaru are a common word pair (see CAD M/2, 117–18).
ina kitti u mīšari lislimū ittīya
Line 31: Urḫu, “way, path.” Damāqu, “to be(come) favorable, good.” Padānu, “way,
path, way of life.” These two nouns are commonly found together (see CAD P, 3). Ešēru,
“to be well, to go well, to be straight.” Both nouns end with a 1cs pronominal suffix (–ī). In
a well-balanced line that shows both grammatical and semantic parallelism, the supplicant
expresses their desire for easier days, which, following as it does on line 30, must have
been closely associated with a renewed positive relationship with their personal deities.39632. ú-ma-ʾi-ir-ma AN . ZA . GÀR DINGIR šá MÁŠ . GE 6 . MEŠ

Line 32: Lines 32–33 are difficult. Uʾʾuru (D of [w]âru), “to give orders to someone, to
send, to commission.” AN . ZA . GÀR = Anzagar is, as the text says, the god of dreams (ili ša
šunāti), for whom see Butler, 83–85. MÁŠ . GI 6 . MEŠ = šunātu, “dreams.” Some translators opt
to make this line the beginning of a conditional sentence, in which Sin is the understood
subject of the verb (see Butler, 392 and Foster, 761). Others, the present work included,
take the verb as a 1cs preterite (a performative like the preterites in lines 25–27, see May-
er, UFBG, 199), thereby making the supplicant the subject (see von Soden, 317 and Seux,
280). Either way, Anzagar is being used here as an intermediary between the supplicant
and the deity the supplicant addresses, Sin.
umaʾʾir-ma Anzagar ili ša šunāti
Line 33: Ina šāt mūši, “at, during night time.” Given the role of the dream god, it
makes sense that the action will take place at night. Paṭāru, “to loosen, undo, release.”
Arnu, “guilt, fault, sin.” The supplicant desires Anzagar to release them from their guilt,
perhaps informing the supplicant through a propitious dream. The details of this idea are
unclear.
ina šāt mūšim lipaṭṭira arnīya
Line 34: Šalāmu, “to be(come) healthy, whole.” All four MS witnesses read the first
verb as lušme, “let me hear” (i.e., “let me know”), which is difficult to understand in con-
text. The present reading (see Butler, 392) assumes that an early exemplar was corrupted
by way of copying a ME sign for the text’s LIM. The signs are quite close in cuneiform.
Šērtu, “guilt, offense, punishment.” Utallulu (Dt of elēlu), “be purified.”
lušlim šērtī lūtallil anāku
Line 35: The prayer ends with the usual promise of praise. Ana darâti, “forever and
ever.” Dalīlū, “praises.” Dalālu, “to praise.” Dalīlīka ludlul is a cognate accusative construc-
tion; that is, the verb and its object both come from the same root. Translate idiomatically,
“let me proclaim your praises.”
ana dārâti dalīlīka ludlul
Line 36: This line is the rubric, that is, it tells something about the classification of
the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric identifies the form of the prayer and to whom it
is directed. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian.𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹 A S HUILLA : S IN 1

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
There are several obvious items we could discuss in a comparative treat-
ment of this prayer with biblical literature. For example, we could compare and
contrast the nature of the primary deity in this prayer and the Hebrew Bible: Sin
is (or is closely associated with) the moon whereas Yahweh created the moon
(Gen 1:14–18). Despite such a difference, both deities are supremely strong (line
1, 21 and, e.g., Exod 15:2–19, Ps 66:3, 2 Chron 20:6), uniquely inscrutable (lines
9, 21 and, e.g., Deut 29:28, Isa 40:13, Job), and universally influential, filling
(malû  ‫)מלא‬ the earth with something of their divinity (line 7 and Isa 6:3, Jer
23:24). We could also note common ritual gestures and postures: kneeling is a
gesture associated with prayer and standing before someone often implies a po-
sition of servitude in both our Mesopotamian prayer (lines 11, 27) and the He-
brew Bible (e.g., 1 Kgs 8:54, Gen 41:46, 1 Kgs 18:15). Or, among still other pos-
sible comparisons, we could choose to consider the common use of “path” and
“way” as metaphors for the course of one’s life (line 31 and, e.g., Prov 4:14,
15:19 [‫ח‬ ‫ֹר‬ ַ ‫א‬ (Akk. urḫu)  ‫ְך‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫)]דּ‬
1 and “calling” as a common means of gaining the
deity’s attention in times of need (compare šasû in line 26 [and other prayers,
see Mayer, UFBG, 129–31] with ‫קרא‬ in the biblical laments of the individual;
see, e.g., Pss 3:5, 22:3, 28:1, 31:18, 61:3, 88:10, 130:1). Instead of looking at
these in more detail, I will turn our attention to the important idea of the divine
assembly and the royal image used to depict its leadership. 2
The biblical writers used the following terms to describe the divine assem-
bly in Israel: ‫ל‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ק‬, ָ in the phrase ‫ים‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ק‬,
“the assembly of the holy ones,” in Ps
89:6; ‫ה‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫ע‬,
found in the phrase ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ת‬ ‫ד‬ ַ ‫ע‬ ֲ , “assembly of god” (Ps 82:1); ‫ד‬ ‫מוֹע‬,
used for
the divine assembly in Isa 14:13 (‫ד‬ ‫מוֹע‬
‫ר‬ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“on the mountain of the assembly”);
1
Urḫu and padānu are often used with the verb ešēru (see CAD P, 3 and CAD E, 355). Compare
the use of the cognate ‫ישׁר‬ in Prov 3:6 (see Tawil, ALCBH, 32).

and ‫סוֹד‬, which is the most frequently used term, attested in the phrase ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫סוֹד‬,
“council of Yahweh,” in Jer 23:18 and 22, ‫ים‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ‫ק‬ ְ ‫סוֹד‬ , “council of the holy ones,”
in Ps 89:8, and ‫לוֹהּ‬
‫א‬ ֱ ‫סוֹד‬, “council of god,” in Job 15:18. These are the semantic
equivalents of our prayer’s puḫru. As one can see, this terminology offers us ra-
ther sparse data for understanding the divine assembly in the Bible. We there-
fore need to locate passages that may be thematically or conceptually relevant;
we need to widen the net.
Besides the broader contexts in which the above terms occur, there are
many other passages that offer evidence for Yahweh’s divine assembly, including
at least the following: Gen 1:26–27, 3:22, 6:1–4, 11:7, Deut 32:8–9, 33:2–3, 1
Kgs 22:19–23, Job 1–2, Pss 29, 58:1, Isa 6, 24:21, 40:1–11, Ezek 1:1–3:15,
28:14, 16, Zech 3, and Dan 10.
Reading these passages together, we may piece together an image of Yah-
weh presiding over his divine assembly as a king (see Ps 29, especially v. 10, Isa
6:1, and 1 Kgs 22:19). Like his human counterpart, here Yahweh held court with
his divine retinue (Job 1:6, 2:1), deliberated about the direction of various hu-
man affairs (1 Kgs 22:19–23  1 Chron 18:18–22), sat in judgment on other di-
vine beings (Ps 82:1–8), and commissioned human messengers to deliver his
words (Isa 6, Jer 23:18–22), among other activities. Like a king, Yahweh is pre-
sented as the ultimate and final authority in the divine assembly—as Sin is pre-
sented in our prayer (lines 11 and 17). Moreover, just as a king’s council would
often meet in the palace (the king’s house), a god’s assembly would often meet
in his house, a temple. Sin’s assembly met in Ekur, according to line 18 of our
prayer; Yahweh’s assembly is explicitly described as meeting in his temple in Isa
6:1. In other words, Yahweh presided over a divine assembly very much like the
one described in our prayer (and known from many other Mesopotamian
sources), even if he alone was considered a god.

A Universal Namburbi: Ea, Shamash, and Asalluḫi 1
J EFFREY L. C OOLEY
E A , S HAMASH :
See pages 227 and 197, respectively.
A SALLUḪI :
Like many minor gods, Asalluḫi (also, Asarluḫi) was once a minor god asso-
ciated with a minor location (Kuara, a site near Eridu), who was later syncre-
tized with a high god. In this case, that high god was Marduk. 1 The earliest evi-
dence for this syncretism is in the OB period. Though it is not entirely clear why
the syncretism took place, it is possible that Marduk, who was up to that point
essentially unknown in the south, was equated with Asalluḫi because of both
deities’ association with incantations. Later, as Marduk continued to grow in
status, his identification with Asalluḫi became entirely confined to such magical
contexts. 2 Alternatively, we know that Asalluḫi was considered the son of Enki.
Perhaps as Marduk’s regional standing increased and he too was afforded this
patrilineage, the two gods were simply equated. 3 Or maybe it was a deliberate
invention on the part of the Babylonian priesthood to give the upstart Marduk
legitimacy via a relationship with Enki by placing him in the Eridu pantheon. 4
Whatever the origin of the Marduk-Asalluḫi syncretism, the latter name is
almost exclusively used as Marduk’s epithet in incantations and prayers. In addi-
tion to this, the syncretism is grounded mythologically twice in Enūma eliš. First,
Anshar dubs the triumphant Marduk “Asalluḫi” (Tablet VI 101), the result of
which all the gods must obey his commands. Though this is not stated explicitly
in Enūma eliš, the logic seems to be that people invoke Marduk-Asalluḫi because
1
Sommerfeld, 13. For more on Marduk, see page 291.
The connection of Asalluḫi with incantations is quite strong, even in the Sumerian material
(though Abusch points out that even this has been overstated; 543). Early evidence for such a
link between Marduk and magic, however, is significantly more limited making this hypothesis
for the syncretism difficult to demonstrate (Sommerfeld, 16–18).

403404the gods are bound, by oath, to obey his commands in the wake of the conflict
with Tiamat. 5 Later on the same tablet (but within the litany of Marduk’s fifty
acquired names), Anu also gives Marduk the name “Asalluḫi” (VI 147) as well as
two variants associated specifically with the Asalluḫi moniker, d nam-til-la and
d
nam-ru. The two names do not seem to reflect any deity actively worshipped or
widely (or narrowly) recognized in the society of ancient Iraq. Rather, they ap-
pear to be deified abstractions that reflect upon specific facets of Marduk-
Asalluḫi’s godhead. The ancient hermeneutics of name etymology in Akkadian
are beyond the scope of this introduction. Nonetheless, a few, brief comments
can be made.
The first of these variants, d nam-til-la, (VI 151) is grounded in the creation
myth: bēlum ša šiptīšu elletim uballiṭu ilī mītūti, “( d nam-til-la is) the lord who, by
his pure incantation, revived the dead gods” (VI 153). This mythic etiology links
Asalluḫi (i.e., Marduk in incantation, šiptu) with Marduk as the gods’ savior in
Enūma eliš (nam-til = balāṭu). 6 Nonetheless, the link that connects this deified
idea and the god Asalluḫi is unclear. The second variant, d nam-ru, (VI 155) is
explained in Enūma eliš as if it were the Akkadian word namru, “shining,” and by
extension, “pure”: ilu ellu mullilu alaktīni, “the pure god who purifies our ways”
(VI 156). 7 However, nam-ru can also be read nam-šub, a logographic writing of
šiptu! 8 In this case it is entirely clear why the abstract idea should be divinized
and associated with Asalluḫi.
In addition to this, both d nam-til-la and d nam-ru appear in the same order in
the god-lists. 9 There, the name d nam-ru is understood differently: Asarluḫi nam-
ru : Marduk ša mēti, “Asalluḫi is Namru : Marduk of the dead.” The scribe who
contributed this explanation in the god list understood the name as Sumerian
and, perhaps, interpreted it as nam = Sumerian abstraction morpheme + šub =
miqittu, “fallen one” (corpse, etc.), creating a (artificial) Sumerian word nam-šub
= “fallenness,” i.e., death. While this answer to the name’s Akkadian explana-
tion in the god-list is admittedly speculative, it is supported by the fact that the
name before it is d nam-til-la, “life.” Such polarized epithets are appropriate de-
scriptors of Marduk as Asalluḫi who is in command of fate, as our prayer tells us
(lines 2–10)
5
Thus, compare lines 4–10 with Enūma eliš VI 102–104 .
Note also, that Marduk, as part his personal armament in his battle against Tiamat, holds an
incantation on his lips, ina šaptīšu tâ ukalla (IV 60). The terms šiptu and tû frequently occur in
parallel (see CAD T, 441 for references). See also our prayer here, line 9.

T HE P RAYER :
This prayer (or more accurately, variations thereof) is unusually well attest-
ed. No less than nine copies, all Assyrian, have come to light. When it can be
determined, the only major variation between copies occurs in the list of omi-
nous signs, with one copy (Maul’s MS C) prepared specifically for Esarhaddon
that includes around two hundred specific possible portents. Our edition here
follows Maul’s MS A, which is the most intact in regards to the opening and clos-
ing sections and provides a workable copy for pedagogical purposes. This
presentation is in no way a critical edition, for which one should consult Maul.
This type of prayer, a namburbi, was employed during a prophylactic ritual
to avert the possible results of evil portents (see page 36 in the general introduc-
tion). Thus, the relationship between such prayers and the Mesopotamian mantic
tradition is significant.
Regardless of how we might organize the prayer, the scribe himself has in-
dicated his own sections by incising section divider lines on the tablet. Lines 1–
20 serve as the opening invocation, in which the supplicant identifies the gods
he is addressing and presents the personal situation which has precipitated the
ritual. The description of the gods is quite verbose in lines 1–17, and this is in-
dicative of the great “sociological” gap between the supplicant and the high
gods. 10 The supplicant, using a common self-presentation formula, presents him-
self as a mere peon who has been terrified by various gloomy portents (lines 18–
20).
Following the invocation is a list of those portents (lines 21–22 and into a
gap of indeterminate length). These omens vary greatly in number and content
by manuscript and are derived from divination literature, specifically the unpro-
voked types, Šumma ālu (terrestrial omens) and Enūma Anu Enlil (celestial
omens). 11 Preserved in the present version are general celestial omen categories:
lunar and solar eclipses, as well as stellar and planetary phenomena. These cate-
gories are all dealt with in separate sections of Enūma Anu Enlil. No doubt, lost
in the lacuna are specific omens within these general categories or perhaps ref-
erence to terrestrial omens. Though not the case in many other prayers, it is
because of these listed omens that we can be certain just who the supplicant
was: the king. Celestial omens always concern the monarchy and the state, never
private individuals. 12
10
For the issue of invocations and social location, see, most recently, Alan Lenzi, “Invoking the
God: Interpreting Invocations in Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments of the Individual,”
JBL 129 (2010), 303–15.
11
This is in opposition to provoked omens, such as extispicy.
12
Astrology, per se, in which celestial phenomena are thought to influence the lives and for-
tunes of the individual, does not appear until the Persian period.406In that gap as well begins the next section (presently consisting of lines 1ʹ–
12ʹ), 13 in which the supplicant describes the solution to these omina. The gods
should act in such a way so as to protect him from the portents and their ill ef-
fects. The image is one of winds that blow by—winds are invisible, but those
they pass can still physically feel the effects. The supplicant specifically requests
that the portents’ evil effects not be allowed to emanate from the ominous sign
(lines 3ʹ–7ʹ: lumuššunu ayy-izīqa, “don’t let their evil blow”). Thus, there is the
recognition that the negative portents will inevitably happen, but the supplicant
wants the gods to keep their ill effects from taking hold on his person. The sum
outcome of the gods’ intervention is the health and well-being of the supplicant,
who will thus be able to continue in his praise and adoration of the gods.
A single line (13ʹ [ MS A’ S rev. 14ʹ]) supplies the rubric describing this par-
ticular prayer: ka-inim-ma ḫul-meš dù-a-bi nam búr-da-kam, literally, “It is the
wording for the resolution of fate concerning all bad things.” There are at least
two references to this prayer (described as nam-búr-bi ḫul dù-a-bi = namburbî
lemni kalāma, “apotropaic ritual against any evil”) in the letters sent by Assyrian
and Babylonian scholars to the Assyrian monarch Esarhaddon and Ashurbani-
pal. 14 In both of these letters, the scholar recommends that the king perform the
ritual. In one of them, the unidentified scholar relays to the king that he should
modify the namburbi (as well as a prescribed shuilla) by inserting the specific
omina against which the prayer is supposed to act. This is the likely explanation
as to why this prayer has a number of variant manuscripts in which the rework-
ings lie entirely in the portents section. The text of this prayer was considered
adjustable to a particular ominous situation and this makes it unique among the
extant namburbi-prayers.
The manuscript ends with a colophon (rev. 15ʹ–18ʹ, not included in this
treatment), 15 identifying the copyist and, it seems, adding a bit of a curse, a not
uncommon feature. 16 It was discovered in Ashur, alongside related tablets in the
so-called “House of the Exorcist.” The copy is written in NA script but the lan-
guage is Standard Babylonian. As is often the case in such circumstances, some
13
The text picks up after the break on the reverse of the tablet after one illegible line. The pre-
served lines of this section in MS A are therefore technically referred to as rev. 2ʹ–rev. 13ʹ. Assyr-
iologists use the prime mark in these situations because it is uncertain how many previous lines
of the prayer are actually missing. In the present treatment, the numbering of these lines will
generally follow Maul’s numbering on pages 475–76 (thus, rev. 2ʹ–rev. 12ʹ = lines 1ʹ–11ʹ) with
one caveat. Maul has omitted MS A’s rev. 13ʹ (= line 12ʹ), which makes the rubric rev. 14ʹ (=
line 13ʹ). All lines after his line 11ʹ therefore should be increased by one (thus, his line 12ʹ is the
present line 13ʹ and the rubric becomes line 14ʹ).

Neo-Assyrianisms peak through: for example, dēn for dīn (lines 2, 11) and ūmē
for ūmī (line 11ʹ). 17

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “spell, incantation, ritual wording.” d UTU = Šamaš. DINGIR = ilu,
“god.” GAL = rabû, “great.” The opening sentence of the prayer, which begins here and
ends in line 4, invokes the appropriate gods who are to act as cosmic judges. These lines
establish certain key concepts (dīna dânu, šimta šâmu, uṣurta uṣṣuru and isqēta ussuku) for
the hymnic section (lines 5–12) of the invocation.
šiptu: Ea Šamaš u Asalluḫi ilī rabûti
Line 2: Dânu (diānu), “to judge.” The form is a G mp participle. Dīnu, “legal decision,
trial.” The word here is in the bound/construct form and the ē suggests a Neo-Assyrianism.
KUR = mātu, “land.” Šâmu (šiāmu), “to decree.” The form is a D mp participle; for this root
the D participle is usually used in place of the G participle. NAM (. TAR ) = šīmtu, “fate, des-
tiny.” Maul restores NAM . MEŠ here (467), making MS A accord with MS B’s preserved read-
ing. But MS A writes NAM . TAR . MEŠ in the two other instances of the word (see lines 5–6).
Assuming scribal consistency, I have restored MS A here in agreement with the usage there.
dāʾinū dēn māti mušimmū šīmāti
Line 3: Eṣēru, “to design, to plan, to draw.” The use of the mp participle continues in
this line. GIŠ . ḪUR = uṣurtu, “design, plan.” Esēqu, “to distribute (lots).” In the D stem, the q
in the root is normally written with a k (see AHw, 249; CDA, 80), though here one could
conceivably read the last sign of the word as qú (see CAD I/J, 201). Isqu, “lot.”

Line 4: AN = šamû, “sky, heaven.” KI = erṣetu, “earth, land.” The writing KI -tim is
simply an orthographic convention—mimation had been lost in Babylonian and Assyrian
for a millennium. Alternatively, one could transcribe tim as tì. Attunu, “you” (2mp subject
pronoun). The –ma on attunu is non-coordinating here, putting the emphasis on the pro-
noun, which brings the opening sentence to completion. One’s translation should highlight
this.

ŠU . II
Line 5: Šâmu and uṣṣuru are inifinitives of šâmu and eṣēru, respectively (see lines 2–3).

šīmāti šâmu uṣurāti uṣṣuru ša qātīkunū-ma
Line 6: TI . LA = balāṭu, “life.” The precise nuance of the phrase šīmat balāṭi (and its
variants) is not entirely clear, but a simple literal translation will suffice (see CAD B, 48;
Š/1, 360). Tašimmā is a G 2cp present/durative from šâmu (see line 2).
šīmāt balāṭi attunū-ma tašimmā
Line 7: Tuṣṣarā is a D 2cp present/durative from eṣēru (see line 3). Note the close
parallelism between lines 6 and 7, which together form a kind of commentary on line 5.
uṣurāti balāṭi attunū-ma tuṣṣarā
Line 8: EŠ . BAR = purussû, “decision.” Parāsu, “to decide.” The grammatical parallelism
in lines 5–6 continues in this line.
purussê balāṭi attunū-ma taparrasā
Line 9: TU 6 = tû, “spell, incantation.” Ṣītu, “product, issuance.” KA = pû, “mouth.” Ṣīt
pî, “utterance, command.” Šalāmu, “to be(come) whole, intact, healthy.” The form is a G
infinitive.
tûkunu balāṭu ṣīt pīkunu šalāmu
Line 10: Epšu, “action; sorcery” (epiš = bound/construct form). Epiš pî, “command.”
The writing of the –um after TI . LA indicates that the mimation is not lost when the enclitic
–ma is added, as is typical for SB.

Line 11: The first half of the line repeats the first half of line 2, essentially beginning
the invocation anew. Kabāsu, “to tread.” The form is a G mp participle. Participles (again)
dominate the next several lines. DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu (f), “wide.” As in line 4, writ-
ings KI -tim and DAGAL -tim are simply an orthographic convention.
dā’inū dēn māti kābisū erṣeti rapašti
Line 12: Ēma, “wherever.” Saḫāpu, “to spread, envelop.” Saḫpū is a G mp predicative.

Line 13: Nakāru, “to change, to eliminate, to remove. Lumnu, “evil.” Šakānu, “to es-
tablish.” Dumqu, “good.” Lines 13–17, which begin a sentence that ends in line 20, offer a
transition from the introductory hymn and the self-presentation formula of 18–20. In this
transition, the supplicant establishes why these are the appropriate gods to invoke: they
are capable of reversing oracular fate.
munakkirū lumni šākinū dumqi
Line 14: Pasāsu, “to erase, to obliterate, to negate.” Á = ittu, “(ominous) sign” (plural
= idātu). GISKIM = ittu, “(ominous) sign” (plural = ittātu). The plural by-forms of ittu,
idātu and ittātu, occur frequently side-by-side in logographic writing Á . MEŠ GISKIM . MEŠ , see
CAD I/J, 307–8 and the discussion of *idatu and ittu on pp. 309–10. Often understood as
simply a pleasant sounding word play involving synonymous plural by-forms of the singu-
lar ittu, Maul has argued that these two terms do, in fact, refer to two different things (ZB,
6–7). GISKIM (= ittu, plural = ittātu) is the animal, plant, star, etc. (or combination of these
things), by which the sign reveals itself (i.e., “omen indicator,” Maul’s “Omenanzeiger”). Á
(= ittu, plural = idātu) is the radiating (positive or negative) power of the GISKIM on the
affected party (Maul’s “‘Abstrahlung’ des Omenanzeiger”). One might not be able to pre-
vent a certain ominous event ( GISKIM ) from occurring, but one might be able deflect its
power ( Á ). ḪUL = lemnu, “evil.”
mupassisū idāti ittāti lemnēti
Line 15: MÁŠ . GI 6 = šuttu, “dream” (pl. šunātu). Pardu, “terrifying.” NU = lā, a negative
particle. DÙG . GA = ṭābu, “good.”

Line 16: Salātu, “to trim, to sever.” Qû, “thread, line.” Maul suggests that the qê lumni
was conceived of as a kind of incubation or development which took place in the time
between the omen’s indication and the actual calamity (ZB, 5) and, in a sense, tied the
omen indicator and result together. It was in the gods’ ability to sever that thread and the
namburbi-ritual initiated that act. Pašāru, “to loosen, to solve, to dispel, to unravel.” Nam-
burbû, “apotropaic ritual” (see introduction).
musallitū qê lumni mupašširū namburbê
Line 17: Mala, “as much as.” Bašû, “to be, to exist.” The form is a G fp predicative.
Mala bašû (and variants) is a common idiom meaning “as much as there is, everything,”
etc.
ēma ittāti mala bašâ
Line 18: Anāku, 1cs subject pronoun. NENNI = annanna ( NENNI -tum = annannītu), “so-
and-so.” A = māru, “son” (mār = bound/construct state). IŠ 8 . DAR = ištaru, “goddess.” As in
lines 4 and 11, mimation is written in a frozen orthography. Lines 18–20 comprise the
main clause of the sentence that began in line 13 and describes precisely: a) who the sup-
plicant is (line 18); b) what has happened (line 19); and c) the supplicant’s resulting emo-
tional condition (line 20).
anāku annanna mār annanna ša ilšu annanna ištaršu annannītu
Line 19: Itabšû (Ntn of bašû), “to happen, to occur repeatedly.” Ittanabšānim-ma is a
3fp durative + ventive/1cs dative + enclitic –ma.
ša idāti ittāti lemnēti ittanabšānim-ma
Line 20: Palāḫu, “to fear.” Adāru, “to fear.” Šutāduru (Št pass. of adāru), “to be fright-
ened.” All three of these verbs are 1cs predicatives. Lines 20–22 are similar to a formula
also found in shuilla-prayers (see Mayer, UFBG, 100–102).
palḫākū-ma adrāku u šutādurāku
Line 21: ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, wickedness” (lumun = bound/construct form). AN . GE 6 =
attalû (also attallû, antalû, antallû), “eclipse.” d 30 = Sîn, the moon god. In the celestial
divination series, Enūma Anu Enlil, not all lunar and solar eclipses were bad portents (for
the lunar eclipse portions of the series, see Francesca Rochberg-Halton, Aspects of Babylo-
nian Celestial Divination: The Lunar Eclipse Tablets of Enūma Anu Enlil [AfOB 22; Horn: Fer-
dinand Berger & Söhne, 1988]; the solar eclipse portions remain unpublished). Nonethe-𒌋𒌋𒁹𒁹𒁹 A U NIVERSAL N AMBURBI TO E A , S HAMASH , AND A SALLUḪI

less, such eclipses were the cause of significant concern in the Assyrian court and every
known example of the so-called substitute king ritual (itself a namburbî) documented in the
reports and letters to the Assyrian kings was instigated by a lunar or a solar eclipses (see
Parpola, LASEA 2, xxii)
ina lumun attalî Sîn ina lumun attalî Šamaš
Line 22: MUL = kakkabu, “star, constellation, planet.” Šūt, “those of . . .” (occurs be-
fore a nominal form in the genitive case). d A-nim is a frozen orthography—the mimation
had not been pronounced for a millennium. d IDIM = Enlil/Ellil. Maul restores d EN . LÍL here
(469), but I am following MS B’s preserved text. The “stars of (the paths) of Ea, Anu and
Enlil” refer to the stars and constellations which fall into three specific regions of the sky,
envisioned as celestial bands running from east to west, and often referred to as ḫarrān šūt
Ea, “Path of Ea,” etc. Particular astral features were associated with each of these bands
(e.g., stars of the Path of Enlil = MUL . APIN I i 1–33; stars of the Path of Anu = MUL . APIN I i
34–ii 18; stars of the Path of Ea = MUL . APIN I ii 19–35; H. Hunger and D. Pingree,
MUL.APIN: An Astronomical Compendium in Cuneiform [AfOB 24; Horn: Ferdinand Berger &
Söhne, 1989]). Erica Reiner and David Pingree understand the Paths of Enlil, Anu, and Ea
to be variously defined sections of the horizon over which stars are expected to rise helia-
cally: Enlil the northern-most, Anu in the center and closest to the celestial equator, while
Ea lies to the south (Babylonian Planetary Omens Part 2: Enūma Anu Enlil, Tablets 50–51
[Bibliotheca Mesopotamica 2.2; Malibu: Undena, 1981], 7). The exact stars contained
within each path vary according to source. Based on the data provided in MUL . APIN , the
Path of Enlil began at about 13 degrees north of east, Ea extended south beginning at
about 11 degrees south of east, and Anu would be the area in between these two points
(Babylonian Planetary Omens Part 3 [Cuneiform Monographs 11; Groningen: Styx, 1998],
15–16). In mentioning all three, the author has effectively included all visible astral phe-
nomena involving the fixed stars exclusively.

Line 23: This entire line is only preserved by a few trace wedges in MS A. Enough is
preserved, however, that the text, preserved in MS B can be recognized. MUL . UDU . IDIM =
bibbu, “wild sheep, a planet.” The term is the common word in astronomical texts to refer
to planets whose movement, relative to the fixed stars, seems erratic at first glance (see the
Greek term πλανήτης, “wanderer”). In some texts MUL . UDU . IDIM refers specifically to Mercu-
ry (and occasionally Saturn or even Mars), but when it is generally used, as in this case, it
refers to any of the planets. KASKAL = ḫarrānu, “path, road, way.” The term here is being
used in its technical sense (see line 22 for discussion of the star paths). Sanāqu, “to ap-
proach.” The form is G 3cs preterite + subjunctive –u. In contrast to the omina alluded to
in line 22, those referred to by this line involve both planets and fixed stars. Conjunctions
of planets and stars were common celestial fodder for omens, and could be either propi-
tious or ominous depending on the planets and stars/constellations involved. For a full
discussion of planetary phenomena in ancient Mesopotamian celestial divination literature,412The prayer has a gap in its text here of indeterminate length.

line finds a very close parallel in newly discovered material in Ludlul IV, line 32 according

Line 3ʹ: IM = the determinative preceding directions, and, by extension, various
winds; in this case we are missing the second part of the word. Zâqu (ziāqu), “to blow.”
The form lizīqam-ma is a G 3cs precative + ventive –am + enclitic –ma. –šunu = 3mp
possessive suffix. Ayy– is the negative particle prefixed before the preterite to create the
vetitive, expressing a negative wish. Ayy-izīqa is to be parsed as a vetitive 3cs + ventive –
am. The final m of the ventive has been lost with the loss of mimation in SB.

Line 8ʹ: Qibītu, “command, speech.” The noun bears a 2mp possessive pronoun suffix
(–kunu). Ṣīru, “exalted, sublime.” KÚR = nakāru, “to be(come) different, to change, to al-
ter.” The logogram probably stands in place of the G infinitive (see also line 9), which is
attested elsewhere in phrases similar to the present one (see CAD N/1, 165).

kīnu occurs often, especially as the positive result of an extispicy; see CAD A/2, 135 for
examples. BAL = enû, “to change, to alter” (see CAD E, 175 for similar phrases).

clear. My translation follows Maul’s “zum (guten) Zeichen dieser Tage” (482).

(literally, “its release, solution”); but it can also be understood as the logogram for šīmtu
(written NAM or NAM . TAR , as it is in lines 2, 5–6). Here, the scribe is understanding NAM in
the latter sense, playing with the name of the ritual namburbî, “its undoing.” Thus, it be-
comes nam búr-da, “to resolve a (negative) destiny” (Maul, ZB, 12). MS B adds seven lines
of ritual instruction after the rubric and before the colophon which is to accompany the
prayer.
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
There are no prayers in the Hebrew Bible designated for the reversal of the
negative fate foretold by an omen. As in any other ancient Near Eastern society,
in ancient Israel there were a plethora of mantic practices, some of which were
sanctioned by the biblical authors (cleromancy, oneiromancy and prophecy),
and many which were not. In any case, we do not have from Iron Age Israel any
manuals of divination (if, indeed, there ever were any). Thus, there is no formal
equivalent of the namburbi-ritual in general or of our prayer here, of which it
was a part. This being said, there are, in fact, several biblical passages in which
the reversal (ritual or otherwise) of a negative oracular fate (delivered via
prophecy, itself a form of divination) is a central theme.
2 Kings 3:4–27 recounts how Mesha of Moab, following the death of the
powerful Ahab, rebels against his Israelite oppressors. In response, the new Isra-
elite king, Jehoram, assembles a coalition which includes both Judah and Edom.
The army encounters severe logistical problems due to the barrenness of the
countryside during their march around the southern end of the Dead Sea, and, as
a result, the kings question whether or not Yahweh is really in support of the
undertaking. They decide to consult a prophet (identified as Elisha), who pro-
vides them with a reluctant but unequivocally positive oracle that includes the
promise of ample supplies and utter victory over Moab (2 Kgs 3:16–19). The
kings’ expedition follows according to the oracle until the coalition is besieging
the last urban center, Kir-hareseth. At this point, following a failed breakout
attempt, Mesha, in an act of desperation, sacrifices his first born son on the city’s
walls. “A great wrath came against Israel” ( ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ל־‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫דוֹל‬ ‫ף־גּ‬
‫צ‬ ֶ ‫ק‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ְ‫י‬ ַ‫ו‬ ) and the coali-
tion army withdraws, leaving Mesha’s Moab bloody, but independent and, there-
fore, victorious. While scholars have variously attempted to slither around the
edges of the theological difficulties in this pericope, 1 the most honest and
A few examples will suffice: the text reflects multiple sources and is therefore sloppily incon-
sistent (Burke Long, “2 Kings III and Genres of Prophetic Narrative,” VT 23 [1973], 337–48); the
prophecy was reversed because Israel broke the laws of conflict as set out in Deut 20:1–20 (even

straightforward reading remains that Yahweh’s oracle delivered through Elisha
was effectively reversed by the ritual of Mesha’s sacrifice of his first-born. 2 The
king of Moab appealed to his god which was undoubtedly Kemosh, though the
biblical text does not acknowledge this overtly. The Israelites were fighting, we
must remember, not in the land of Yahweh’s inheritance, but in Kemosh’s home
turf. Mesha performed the most poignant and powerful cultic act available to
him, and the god of Moab responded to the king’s faith by intervening with the
oracular fate set out by the god of Israel. 3 This is in many ways similar to the
logic of the namburbi, but a fundamental difference is that Mesha is not invok-
ing the god of the original oracle, Yahweh, in his ritual.
A further biblical passage which displays the logic of the namburbi, perhaps
most strongly, is Isaiah 38:1–8 and its parallel in 2 Kings 20:1–9. When Hezeki-
ah becomes quite ill, the prophet Isaiah comes to the king (whether he has been
consulted or has come on his own accord is not stated) and offers the monarch
an oracle from Yahweh. It is not propitious: ‫לֹא‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ‫תּ‬ ָ ‫א‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ָך‬ ‫ית‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ֵ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ו‬ ‫צ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ ‫כֹּה‬
‫ה‬ ֶ‫י‬ ‫ח‬ ְ ‫ת‬,
“Thus Yahweh has said, ‘Command your household, for you are about to
die and you will not recover.’” Hezekiah responds to the oracle immediately and
ritually: ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫ל־י‬ ‫א‬ ֶ ‫ל‬ ֵ‫לּ‬ ‫פּ‬ ַ ‫ת‬ ְ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫יר‬ ‫קּ‬ ִ ‫ל־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫יו‬ ָ‫נ‬ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫הוּ‬ ָ‫י‬ ‫ק‬ ִ ְ‫ז‬ ‫ח‬ ִ ‫ב‬ ‫סּ‬ ֵ ַ‫ויּ‬ , “Hezekiah turned his face to the
wall and prayed to Yahweh,” reminding Yahweh how he has served him faithful-
ly. 4 Both the supplicant of the namburbi, who admits his personal fear in formu-
laic terms (line 20: palḫākū-ma adrāku u šutādurāku, “I am scared, frightened,
terrified”), and Hezekiah, who weeps while praying, attempt to show deep sin-
cerity—and this sincerity adds to the legitimacy (and thus potency) of the ritual.
Yahweh’s response is almost as quick. Having heard the prayer and observed the
weeping, the god of Israel reverses the oracle, which Isaiah promptly delivers:
the king will live for another fifteen years and the city will be rescued from As-
syria. In the account in 2 Kings 20, the prophet then applies a dressing made of
fig cakes ( ‫ים‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫תּ‬ ְ ‫ת‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫ב‬ ֶ ‫דּ‬ ְ ) to Hezekiah’s skin condition, which is apparently what was
ailing him (2 Kgs 20:7). 5 While appearing to the modern reader as a form of
homeopathic medicine, we must remember that such healing procedures, espe-
cially if applied by a religious professional, were rarely devoid of religious di-
mensions. As in the case of Mesopotamian disease theory, the patient’s illness
though breaking these laws was part of the oracle! Joe Sprinkle, “Deuteronomic ‘Just War’
[Deut. 20, 10–20] and 2 Kings 3, 27,” ZABR 6 [2000], 285–301); the prophecy was technically
fulfilled because the army did, in fact, attack all of the cities of Moab (Raymond Westbrook,
“Elisha’s True Prophecy in 2 Kings 3,” JBL 124 [2005], 530–32).

The significance of the specific posturing, towards the wall, is unclear. It could be that it has
some ritual importance.
5
This act is placed after the sign of the reverse shadow in the Isaiah account (Isa 38:21).416was by no means a “natural” thing, but was, rather, the result of an angry god. 6
Thus, here changing the results of the original oracle requires multiple ritual
acts, i.e., the prayer and the application of the fig cake to the affected area. In
this sense, Isaiah is not only functioning as a proper diviner, but also as an āšipu!
To confirm the results of the new, positive oracle, Yahweh offers an alternate
sign: the shadow on a kind of sundial will go backwards instead of forwards. 7
This is a new sign for a new oracle and Hezekiah’s repentance has literally
turned back the clock on the previous prophecy. Again, this is the same logic as
the namburbi: the appropriate ritual can reverse oracular fate.
In 1 Kings 22 we have another instance in which the party affected by a
negative oracle takes action to prevent the oracular fate from taking effect. In
this passage, the kings of Israel and Judah decide to retake Ramoth-Gilead from
Aram. After agreeing to participate in the campaign, the king of Judah, Jehosh-
aphat, requests that the leaders invoke an oracle from Yahweh in order to de-
termine whether or not the undertaking has divine sanction: ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫ל־מ‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ט‬ ‫פ‬ ָ ‫יְהוֹשׁ‬
‫ר‬ ‫אמ‬
ֹ ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬
‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫ת־דּ‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫יּוֹם‬ ‫כ‬ ַ ‫א‬ ָ‫שׁ־נ‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫דּ‬ ְ ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ , “Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, ‘Please in-
quire now the word of Yahweh’” (1 Kgs 22:5). The king of Israel assembles a
large group of prophets who uniformly deliver the deity’s blessing on the cam-
paign. Dissatisfied with this, Jehoshaphat asks the king of Israel for a second
oracle to confirm the first, and the king reluctantly sends for Micaiah ben Im-
lah. 8 Micaiah’s first oracle delivered in the kings’ presence is in agreement with
that of the group (1 Kgs 22:15). Incredulous, the king of Israel demands that the
prophet tell him Yahweh’s true will and the chilling vision that follows contra-
dicts the oracle delivered by the pandering group of prophets. The kings develop
a plan which, to a certain degree, recognizes the legitimacy of both oracular
fates—they launch their campaign, but the king of Israel (now identified as
Ahab; 1 Kgs 22:20) disguises himself, eschewing his royal garment for, we pre-
sume, those of a common soldier. The battle, as Micaiah predicted, is a disaster
for the coalition. Ahab’s disguise does not protect him and he dies as a result of
an arrow wound to the chest. The king’s solution to the negative oracular fate
offered by Micaiah is not a ritual one. Even so, the parallel to a well-documented
namburbi, the substitute king ritual, in which a prisoner dons the garb of the
king in order to absorb the ill effects of a negative omen, 9 is far too strong to

7
The sign (‫)אוֹת‬ here is not an omen, per se, in that it is not an indicator of the god’s will that
needs to be interpreted, but is rather a confirmatory sign from the god. Nonetheless, the rela-
tionship between an omen and this kind of confirmatory sign is significant: they both indicate
divine will.

ignore. 10 In both cases, the king attempts to avoid his oracular fate by disguising
himself. 11 Though the solutions are different in nature (the namburbi is a ritual,
that of Israel’s king is not), there is an element of logic shared by the two, even
if it is not as tight as that of Isa 38:1–8/2 Kgs 20:1–9. Oracular fate is not final
and can possibly be averted.
While these biblical parallels by no means comprise a single formal ritual,
such as a namburbi, they nonetheless demonstrate that the god’s will, as ex-
pressed through an oracle, could be changed with the suitable ritual demonstra-
tion. These demonstrations were appropriate to the nature of the oracle and the
person(s) to whom it was directed.

A Namburbi against the Evil of a Snake:
Shamash 25
D UANE S MITH
S HAMASH :
See page 197.
T HE P RAYER :
This prayer is typical in structure and content of the incantation section of
namburbi-rituals. 1 The intent of such rituals is to mitigate or nullify the evil por-
tents of omens (see page 36 for more about namburbis). In the present case, the
namburbi seeks to nullify the portent of an unsolicited omen, omina oblativa, in
the form of a snake seen hunting in the supplicant’s house. 2 The formal structure
of Shamash 25 is as follows:
I) Invocation (1–9a)
A) The god’s name and honorific titles (1–3)
B) Praise for the god’s nature and special skills (4–9a)
1) In terms of unalterable commands (4–6)
2) In terms of reviving the dead and releasing the captive (7–9a)
II) Petition (9b–21)

See Mayer, UFBG, 34–35.
Šumma ālu Tablets 22–26 (see Sally Freedman, If a City Is Set on a Height: The Akkadian Omen
Series Shumma Alu ina mele Shakin Vol. 2: Tablets 22–40 [Occasional Publications of the Samuel
Noah Kramer Fund 19; Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Museum Babylonian Section,
2006], 6–130) contain a large number of snake related omens. Of the hundreds of snake-related
omens in Šumma ālu none exactly matches the two elements (a snake seen entering a man’s
house and hunting there) that one would expect in the protasis if our prayer was intended to
mitigate one of these portents. The protasis of Šumma ālu 23:106 (ibid., 46–47) addresses a
snake entering a man’s house, “if a snake enters a man’s house, that house will be abandoned.”
Several omen protases address snakes hunting specific prey in a man’s house. For example,
Šumma ālu 25–26 ii 6ʹ-7ʹ (ibid., 106–7) and Šumma ālu 25–26:16ʹ, 22ʹ (ibid., 118–19). Regarding
snake omens and namburbi-rituals, see Erica Reiner, Astral Magic in Babylonia (TAPS 85/4; Phil-
adelphia: The American Philosophical Society, 1995), 83, n.338.

421422A) Self-presentation (9b–13)
B) Acknowledgement of reverential stance vis-a-vis the god (14–15)
C) Lament (16–20a)
D) Plea (20b–21)
III) Conditional promise of praise for the god (22–26) 3
The prayer begins with an invocation that not only calls upon Shamash in
terms of several of his honorific titles but also in terms of the effectiveness of his
commands. The invocation ends with reference to Shamash’s ability to revive
the dead and release the captive. The reference to these powers provides a tran-
sition to the petition, where the supplicant first introduces themselves and then,
using the language of submission, “seize your hem,” indicates their reverential
posture. Here follows a lament in which the supplicant expresses their fears re-
garding the evil portent of a snake seen hunting in their house and pleas to be
saved. Just as Shamash can release the captive, the supplicant desires that Sha-
mash release them from the evil portent. Finally, the supplicant provides Sha-
mash with motivation. If Shamash saves them, they will be able to praise Sha-
mash and in so doing will inspire others to do the same.
Unfortunately, the one tablet that bears the text of this prayer (VAT 5) lacks
ritual instructions; it only preserves the prayer. Since there are a number of
namburbi-rituals against the evil of snakes, 4 it is impossible to reconstruct the
precise ritual instructions that might have once been associated with our par-
ticular prayer. But another namburbi-ritual that seeks to nullify the evil portent
of a snake hunting in a house incorporates a prayer very similar to ours and may
shed light on the kinds of ritual actions that could have been prescribed to ac-
company our prayer. 5 The ritual begins with the words “namburbî lumun ṣēri ana
amīli lā iṭeḫḫe lumuššu amīla lā išakkan, “a namburbi (that) the evil of a snake may
See Mayer, UFBG, 35, for a summary of the more common, two-part analysis of this prayer.
Mayer uses Shamash 25 as a paradigm example of the structure of a namburbi-prayer. Differing
slightly from Mayer, I take the conditional offer of praise as a separate unit. See Shamash 1, page
369, for discussion. Separating the “acknowledgement of reverential stance” from the “self-
introduction,” I also see the structure of the petition section of the prayer as somewhat more
complex than does Mayer.

lished by Irvine L. Finkel, “On Late Babylonian Medical Training,” in Wisdom, Gods and Litera-
ture: Studies in Assyriology in Honour of W. G. Lambert (ed. A. R. George and Irving Finkel;
Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 137–224, here 206–7, texts 49A and 49B. Finkel has also
published several Old Babylonian incantations related to snakes (“On some Dog, Snake and
Scorpion Incantations,” in Mesopotamian Magic: Textual, Historical, and Interpretative Perspectives
[ed. Tzvi Abusch and K. van der Toorn; Groningen: Styx, 1999], 211–52, here 223–34). These
incantations, however, are not namburbi-prayers in structure; they appear to address the direct
danger of snakes rather than their ominous portents. As such, they provide a significant contrast
with prayers such as Shamash 25.

See Maul, 278–82, 80-7-19,88, obv. 7–rev. 15 and minor variants. While this text provides a
close parallel to our prayer, it is sufficiently different to preclude it from being an alternative
witness to Shamash 25.

not approach a man, (that) its evil may not affect a man.” According to its ritual
instructions, at sunset the practitioner draws water, mixes in various plant prod-
ucts (barleys, emmer, lentils) and metals (silver and gold), and sets them “under
the stars.” In a secluded place, they prepare a reed altar for Shamash. They place
various items including bread, honey, and ghee on and around the altar. The
practitioner dips various stones (carnelian, lapis lazuli, plus several others) and
metals (copper, tin, silver, and gold) in oil and then makes a necklace from them
for the supplicant. At this point, the exact actions of the practitioner are unclear
but eventually they make the supplicant recite an incantation that is very much
like Shamash 25.

Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, spell, ritual wording.” On the various uses of this
word, see CAD Š/3, 86–91. d UTU = Šamaš. Šarru, “king.” AN -e = šamê from šamû, “heav-
en.” KI = erṣetim, “earth.” The stock phrase šar šamê u erṣetim, “king of heaven and earth,”
has Sumerian antecedents and was applied to several gods, most notably Enlil. The sen-
tence that begins here ends in line 9a.
šiptu: Šamaš šar šamê u erṣetim
Line 2: EN = bēlu, “lord.” Kittu, “truth,” was commonly deified, as was mīšaru, “jus-
tice.” As such, they are the children of Shamash. See Shamash 1, lines 37–38 on page 377.
bēl kitti u mīšari
Line 3: The tablet is abraded in various parts of this line. The reading follows Maul,
296, n.8. Anunnakkū is a collective name from Sumerian that likely originally specified all
the gods of the pantheon but later, and particularly in Akkadian contexts, may only refer
to gods of earth and the underworld (see Black and Green, 34). GIDIM = eṭemmu, “spirit of
the dead, ghosts.” The eṭemmū were normally inhabitants of the underworld (see Black and
Green, 88–89 and page 133 in this book). Bēl anunnakkī bēl eṭemmī is a common divine
epithet for Shamash (see CAD E, 398).

Line 4: Annu, “approval, consent.” The 3ms pronominal suffix on the noun is redun-
dant with the relative pronoun; together they can be rendered “whose.” The relative pro-
noun heads a clause that ends in line 6. Note the consonance between the first words of
line 4 and lā innû in line 5. An annu is often a positive divine answer to a query. Note, for
example, ša ilum annam lā ippalūšu, “to which the god will not give a positive answer”
(cited in CAD A/2, 135). DINGIR = ilu, “god.” Mammam, “somebody.” The presence of ilu
puts us in the divine realm. With a negative, mammam means “nobody.” Thus, “no god.”
ša annašu ilu mammam
Line 5: NU = lā. BAL -ú = enû, “to change, to revise.” Innû is a G durative with sub-
junctive –u. Qibītu, “word, command.” Qibīssu has a 3ms pronominal suffix attached; the
adjacent –tš– becomes –ss–. The word should be taken as the subject of the verb in the
following line.
lā innû qibīssu
Line 6: The somewhat damaged text appears to read uš-NU-pe-e-li (see CAD Š/3, 323),
but Maul’s emendation, used here, is certainly correct (296). Šutepêlu (Št pass. of šupêlu),
“to be changed” (the root is a Š-group middle weak quadriliteral; see GAG, §109j). The
verb is a 3cs durative. Since this line continues the relative clause started in line 4, we
expect a verb in the subjunctive here, uštepellu. See CAD Š/3, 323 for examples of both the
subjunctive and the form used here.
lā uštepêli
Line 7: LÚ . ÚŠ = mītu, “a dead person.” In some contexts mītu appears to mean “grave-
ly ill.” Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to revive, to bring back to life,” is an inf., perhaps best ren-
dered here as a gerund (see also the inf. in line 8). For mīta bulluṭu, see CAD M/2, 141.
With regard to Shamash, note the personal name Šamaš-mītam-uballiṭ, “Shamash-Revives-
the-Dead.” This line and the next two bring the invocation to an end with references to
those aspects of Shamash’s nature that are most important to the petition that follows. Not
only does this line and the next give emphasis to the invocation, they also provide a transi-
tion to the petition. The reprise of a direct call to Shamash by name lends emphasis to
lines 7 and 8.
Šamaš mīta bulluṭu
Line 8: Kasû, “bound, a captive.” Paṭāru, “to loosen, to release,” is another inf. Notice
the grammatical parallelism with mīta bulluṭu in line 7.

Line 9: ŠU = qātu, “hand.” ŠU . II , ŠU + two vertical wedges (the MIN sign), indicates
the dual; qātī is the oblique dual form. Here “your hands” should be understood as “in
your power.” CAD Q, 189 restores <ina> before šu. II -ka-ma. While rare, the omission of
the preposition is not unknown. No meaning is lost. See CAD Q, 192 for examples of qātu,
meaning “in your/his power,” without the preposition in constructions with verbs. The
invocation of the deity’s name again here provides a transition into the petition section of
the prayer.

Line 10: ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.” Aradka is the bound form with a 2ms pro-
nominal suffix. This line begins the second major section of the prayer. Lines 10–14 form
one sentence with the self-presentation formula (lines 10–13) as its subject.

Line 13: Zarpanitum is the consort of Marduk. In private communications Alan Lenzi
speculated that “Marduk” and “Zarpanitum” are not placeholders but possibly indicate
that this ritual may have been copied for a particular family or, more likely, the [office of
the] king of Babylon; thus the copyist could assume “Marduk” and “Zarpanitum” were his
personal gods.
Zarpānītum
Line 14: Maḫru, “before, in the presence of.” Maḫarka is a bound form of the word
plus a 2ms pronominal suffix. GUB -iz ! = azziz from i/uzuzzu, “to stand, to appear,” specifi-
cally before a person or god. The reading is difficult. Maul, 297, reads G [ U ] B -ka. Mayer,
UFBG, 139, citing the common expression maḫarka azziz, suggests the reading adopted
here. It is possible that the scribe confounded ana maḫarka azziz and simply added ka (See
Maul, 297, n.12; Mayer, UFBG, 139; and Seux, 364, n.4).

Line 15: TÚG . SÍG = sissiktu, “hem, fringe.” Sissiktu here is the hem of a garment. Aṣbat
from ṣabātu, “to seize, to take hold of.” On sissikta with ṣabātu as a gesture of supplication
to a god, see CAD Ṣ, 18. Ṣabātu is also used in legal contexts and as an indication of sub-
mission to a king or someone else in authority. Sissiktaka aṣbat can also mean “to swear an
oath.” See further, André Finet, “Les symboles du cheveu, du bord du vêtements et de
l’ongle en Mésopotamie,” in Eschatologie et Cosmologie (ed. Armand Abel; Annales du

sissiktaka aṣbat
Line 16: With this line and the next, we come to the central petition of the prayer: a
bad omen in the form of a snake pursuing prey in the house. This subsection begins with a
lament that continues through the first part of line 20. Here ina, in expressions like ina
lumun X, has a causative or instrumental meaning, “because, by means of, on account of.”
Contrast this with the meaning of the second ina in our line. ḪUL = lumnu, “evil, misery.”
MUŠ = ṣerru (ṣēru), “serpent, snake.” É = bītu, “house.” The relative pronoun ša begins a
clause that describes which snake the supplicant is talking about. The clause ends with the
subjunctive verb amuru in line 18.
ina lumun ṣerri ša ina bitīya
Line 17: Maul reads [ ]- IGI -ru-ma at the beginning of the line (297). The text above
follows CAD E, 205 ([e]-ši(IGI)-ru-ma). Ešēru, “to make straight, to proceed.” This infinitive
and the one in line 18 describe what the supplicant saw the snake do. The –ma functions
as a marker of continuity of activity, “and then.” Buʾ(ʾ)uru (bûru) “hunting; game, prey”
(see CAD B, 366 and CDA, 51).
ešērū-ma bûru
Line 18: DÙ -šú = epēšu, “to do, to make,” but with buʾ(ʾ)uru, “to hunt.” On this idiom,
see CAD E, 205 and B, 366. Amāru, “to see.”
epēšu amurū-ma
Line 19: All the verbs in this line and the next are 1cs predicatives. Palāḫu, “to fear,
to be afraid.” Adāru, “to be afraid (of), to fear.” We expect adrāku rather than adrāka (see𒌋𒌋𒐼 A N AMBURBI AGAINST THE E VIL OF A S NAKE : S HAMASH 25

Mayer, UFBG, 73). Palḫāku adrāku (u) sutādurāku is a stock expression in prayers.
palḫāku adrāka
Line 20: Šutādurāku is a Št 1cs predicative (from adāru). It means “I am constantly in
fear.” See CAD A/1, 109 for a discussion of šutādurāku and related words. BI = šuāti, a
gen. 3ms independent demonstrative pronoun.
u šutādurāku ina lumni šuāti
Line 21: Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to make pass by, to avert.” The form is a ms impv. plus
1cs acc. pronominal suffix. See CAD E, 394 for this stock phrase. This plea, the only one in
the prayer, ends the petition section of the prayer.
šūtiqannī-ma
Line 22: Narbû, “greatness.” Šāpû (Š of [w]apû), “to proclaim, to announce.” Lušāpi is
a 1cs precative. This line begins the prayer’s final section, the conditional promise of
praise. The first two lines are stock phrases (see CAD A/2, 202–3).
narbīka lušāpi
Line 23: Dalīlīka from dalīlu, “praise, glory, fame.” It is common for dalīlu to be in the
plural, particularly when referring to gods or kings and always when used with dalālu (see
CAD D, 50). Dalālu, “to glorify, to proclaim.” Ludlul, like lušāpi, is a 1cs precative. Those
who read or heard this very common doxological phrase would have been well aware of
the binding consonance within and between these two words. While clumsy as a transla-
tion, “your praises, let me praise” is a reasonable representation of the vocabulary, gram-
mar, and to some extent consonance.
dalīlīka ludlul
Line 24: Āmirūya (from amāru, see line 18) is a G mp participle plus a 1cs pronominal
suffix. The preposition ana governs the noun in the next line.
āmirūya ana
Line 25: Dārītu, “eternity,” is in the plural here, darâtu, though we expect a gen.,
darâti. Ana darâti means “forever, eternally.” Maul (297, n.13) notes that one expects dalīlī
with a 2ms pronominal suffix (–ka). The above notation indicates the scribe has mistaken-
ly omitted it. Note the alliteration between darâtu and dalīlīka that binds these words to-
gether in much the same way as dalīlīka ludlul are bound together by consonance both here42826. lid-lu-lu TE . ÉN
and in line 23. The whole phrase, darâtu dalīlīka lidlulū, is bound tightly by both allitera-
tion and consonance.
ana darâtu dalīlīka
Line 26: Although Maul adopts LID as the best reading, he suggests that the first sign
in the line might be read NI (297). In other words, the first sign may be an example of the
poorly attested líd reading. One’s decision on this does not affect the meaning. Maul’s copy
appears to favor reading lid (542). Lidlulū is a 3mp precative from dalālu. The subject of
dalālu has changed from the supplicant, line 23, to those who see the supplicant here.
TE . ÉN follows the prayer just as ÉN precedes it. Together they form an inclusio, delineating
the beginning and the end of the prayer.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Shamash 25 deals with dispelling the evil portent of snakes, ṣerru, hunting
in one’s house. While there are several different words for “snake” and “serpent”
in Hebrew, ‫שׁ‬ ‫ח‬ ָ ָ‫נ‬ is the most frequently used and is likely the closest semantic
equivalent to Akkadian ṣerru (ṣēru). Jer 8:17 and Qoh 10:11 both mention spells
( ‫שׁ‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫ל‬ ַ ) against snakes. However, unlike the underlying assumption of Shamash
25, the Qohelet passage highlights the uselessness of the charmer after the snake
bites. In the Jeremiah passage, it is Yahweh himself who will send uncharmable
snakes. 1
In much the same way as Shamash 25, biblical Psalms frequently contain
petitions followed by vows of praise. For example, Ps 7 begins with an invoca-
tion followed by a rather complex petition, including a lament, and ends with a
vow of praise. Other psalms ending with vows or vow-like elements include Pss
13, 14, 21, 22, 35, 53, 54, 56, 57, 59, 61, 69, 79 and 109.
Although šar šamê u erṣetim in line 1 may be echoed in Jdt 9:12, and later
theology clearly identified the Judean and Israelite monotheistic god with the
king of heaven and earth, surprisingly the Hebrew Bible does not contain a pre-
cise parallel to šar šamê u erṣetim, “king of heaven and earth.” 1 Chron 29:10–12
may well provide an extended paraphrase of the divine epithet. Zech 14:9 and
Dan 4:34 separately reflect the two halves of the epithet: Zech 14:9 proclaims
Yahweh, ‫ץ‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫א‬ ָ ‫ל־ה‬
‫ל־כּ‬
‫ע‬ ַ ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫מ‬ ֶ , “king over all the earth,” and Dan 4:34 (in Aramaic)

Two incantations tablets treated by Finkel, “Incantations,” 223–29, may provide closer parallels
to Jer 8:17b than does Shamash 25 (See CBS 7005:13 and IM 5192:2, cited in note 4 above). On
snakes that cannot be conjured, see also the Sumerian Gilgamesh, Enkidu and the Netherworld
version A, lines 42, 85, 129, and 140 (ur 2 -bi-a muš tu 6 nu-zu-a-e gud 3 im-ma-ni-ib-us 2 , “At its
roots, a snake immune to incantations made itself a nest.” [ETCSL trans.]).𒌋𒌋𒐼 A N AMBURBI AGAINST THE E VIL OF A S NAKE : S HAMASH 25

has Nebuchadnezzar acknowledge Yahweh as ‫א‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫מ‬,
“king of the heavens.” 2
For the more general juxtaposition of “heavens” and “earth” in BH and Akkadian
prayers, see page 379.
1 Sam 15:27 attests BH’s semantic equivalent of sissiktaka aṣbat: ‫ק‬ ֵ‫ז‬ ‫ח‬ ֲ ַ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬
‫ע‬ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫קּ‬ ָ ִ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ ‫יֹלו‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫ף־מ‬
ַ‫נ‬ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫בּ‬,
“and he [i.e., Saul] took hold of the hem of his [i.e., Samuel’s]
cloak and it tore.” (Old Aramaic, ‫בכנף‬ ‫אחז‬, and Ugaritic, ʿḫd bsin, also reflect the
expression.) To take hold of the hem is an act of both submission and allegiance.
Tearing the hem implies rejection. 3

Most MSS of Jdt 9:12 read δέσποτα τῶν οὐρανῶν καὶ τῆς γῆς but Codex Alexandrinus reads βασιλευς.
The larger context of Judith is Assyrian hegemony but it is hard to know the extent to which, if
at all, the passage echoes the Akkadian divine epithet. G. Brooke Lester noted this possible paral-
lel in a private communication. Of interest in this regard is Ps 103:19 where Yahweh is said to
have “established His throne in heaven and His sovereign rule is over all” (JPS).
3
On the tearing of a hem in an Akkadian prayer, see page 184, line 8 and related discussion
there. Tawil, “Hebrew ‫ד‬ ‫י‬ ַ ‫ץ‬ ‫פ‬ ֵ ַ‫נ‬,” 79–82 argues that ‫יד‬ ‫נפץ‬ in Dan 12:7, reflecting Akkadian qāta
napāṣu, “to thrust away the hand,” also has this negative connotation.

Dingirshadibbas to Personal Deities
A LAN L ENZI
T HE P ERSONAL G OD / G ODDESS :
Personal deities, both gods and goddesses, were generally minor deities in
the Mesopotamian pantheon that, as the name implies, had special significance
to an individual (henceforth, the protégé). 1 The personal deities were the creator
(bānû) and protector (nāṣiru) of the protégé. They cared (rāʾimu) for the protégé,
sustained their well-being (balāṭu), secured and maintained their social position
(via a šumu damqu, “a good name”), and generally granted the protégé success in
their varied endeavors, both personal and professional (ila rašû, “to obtain a
god” means “to have success, good fortune,” see CAD R, 194). In many respects,
the personal god was a kind of projection of the protégé’s parents onto the di-
vine sphere. Given the function and importance of the personal gods, people
owed them reverence and respect (ila palāḫu, “to fear the god,” and ila karābu,
“to bless the god, to greet the god in an honored manner” 2 ). If the individual did
something wrong, the personal deity could become angry and abandon the pro-
tégé. Or, if the protégé was experiencing difficulties of some kind, they might
believe these to be the result of the personal god’s anger and abandonment. In
any case, the anger and/or abandonment of the personal god left the protégé
without protection, open to further hardships or afflictions. The protégé would
therefore pray to the deity directly (as in dingirshadibba-prayers) or ask another
deity to intercede on their behalf (as in many shuilla-prayers) in order to soothe
the god’s anger and renew amicable fellowship.
Although personal deities had a special relationship to individuals, they
were not conceived in strictly individualistic terms like present-day imaginings
of guardian angels. Rather, the veneration of the personal god always took place
in a familial or communal context. In many respects, the personal god is more
like a family god. As such, the personal god could act as a witness to legal set-
tlements and an enforcer in family disputes or problems. The choice of one’s

This section is especially indebted to van der Toorn’s work, which is the best treatment of the
personal god currently available.

der Toorn, 113 and the general introduction, page 30.
431432personal god—or rather the god’s identity since there was little choice normal-
ly—was typically restricted to the personal deity of one’s parents. This is evi-
denced at times by the same theophoric element in personal names from genera-
tion to generation within a family. But the selection of a personal deity may also
have been contingent upon other factors: local (e.g., a nearby temple or shrine)
or occupational (e.g., many scribes took Nabu or Nisaba as their personal deity).
A woman, upon marriage, would give up revering the god of her father (ili abīša)
for that of her husband (ili bēlīša), showing again the familial association of the
personal god.
Although personal gods were usually minor or tertiary deities within the
Mesopotamian pantheon (e.g., Ninshubur, Ishtar’s vizier, was a common person-
al god, whereas Ishtar herself is never attested as a personal god nor is Anu),
there are exceptions. For example, Enlil, one of the chief gods of the pantheon,
on occasion took the role of an individual’s personal god. It seems, however, that
this practice was generally limited to kings.
T HE P RAYER :
This treatment includes two brief examples of dingirshadibba-prayers. In
fact, the division of the Akkadian text into two rather than three incantation-
prayers is not unanimous among the textual witnesses. The issue revolves
around the division of the material in lines 18–31 of this treatment. Some MSS in
Lambert’s edition preserve a rule line between our lines 21 and 22, suggesting
lines 18–21 and lines 22–31 be counted as two prayers instead of one. (Thus, the
material treated here would contain three prayers: 1–17, 18–21, and 22–31.)
Two MSS leave this ruling out and therefore see the material in lines 18–31 as
one prayer. (Thus, we have two prayers in the material treated here: 1–17 and
18–31.) Lambert’s MS K rearranges the material we identify as lines 18–31 as if it
were dealing with two blocks of text, two prayers: our lines 22–31 occur before
lines 18–21 on the tablet and a rule line separates the two textual blocks. In an-
other vein of support for dividing lines 18–31 into two prayers, Lambert’s MS B
includes (a broken) ÉN (šiptu) at the head of line 22, indicating the start of a new
incantation. But this is ambiguous evidence since MS B skips line 32 (the rubric)
and continues uninterrupted into what the other textual witness to this material
considers a separate prayer (i.e., Lambert’s MS K has a ruling after its placement
of our line 21, indicating a break before the next incantation-prayer on the tab-
let [not included here]). This textual diversity should come as no surprise to
anyone working with incantation-prayers. As a matter of convenience, the pre-
sent treatment follows previous translators in treating the following thirty-one
lines of Akkadian as two prayers.
The first prayer begins with a brief invocation of the personal god and a
statement of the supplicant’s ignorance of the severity of the god’s punishment
(note the predicative verb, dannat). The supplicant’s ignorance, commonly found
in penitential contexts, is a theme throughout the first half of the prayer. In the
next five lines the supplicant confesses their sins using mostly Gtn preterites or G𒌋𒌋 𒐊 D INGIRSHADIBBAS TO P ERSONAL D EITIES
433
perfects—the forms are ambiguous. This confession culminates in line 7, which
summarizes the supplicant’s sins (using a predicative verb, mādū) and reiterates
their ignorance, though this time the ignorance refers to what they actually did.
Line 7 recalls the first line of the prayer in its use of a predicative and its reprise
of the supplicant’s ignorance. Lines 8–10 contain the first wave of petitions.
These are directed only to the personal god (not the goddess) and are centered
on forgiveness of sins. Lines 11–12 are another confession of sorts but not of sin.
Rather, in words that recall line 1 (again) the supplicant confesses in line 11, or
rather professes, to understanding and having experienced (amāru) the severity
(note the predicative, dannat) of the god’s punishment (šēretka). This, they assert
in line 12, makes them a model from which other sinners should learn (amāru).
Having made this profession, the supplicant renews their attempts in lines 13–16
to reconcile with their deities via a series of petitions. The first two petitions are
directed separately to each of the personal deities, one to the god and one (the
first in the prayer) to the goddess (line 13). The remaining petitions are ad-
dressed to both deities (lines 14–16). The prayer concludes with a long and em-
phatic promise of praise (line 17).
The second prayer begins with an invocation that is rather long for a ding-
irshadibba-prayer. Five different phrases over two lines (18–19) invoke the dei-
ty. All of these epithets are related to the supplicant in a personal manner, which
is quite unlike the epithets in the hymnic introduction to shuilla-prayers. Follow-
ing this invocation are two formulaic petitions addressed to the personal god
and goddess, respectively. Since only the god was invoked in lines 18–19 and
the remainder of the text is addressed to him alone (note the 2ms pronominal
suffixes), this couplet creates a disjunction in the text. Lines 22–23 describe hu-
man ignorance, both generally and the supplicant’s particularly, with regard to
the divine abode in preparation for the prayer’s only expression of lament in line
24. Without the divine presence, the supplicant complains in line 24, they are
helpless. The prayer concludes with a series of petitions in lines 25–31 (and a
ritual meal in line 26). In these lines the supplicant tries to convince the god to
relent from his anger and restore the supplicant’s life (balāṭu, see lines 28, 30,
31)—long life, according to line 31. The first four lines of this block (lines 25–
28) sequentially mention four parts of the god’s body associated with the head
(i.e., neck, face, lips, and mouth). The last of these is the means for carrying out
the supplicant’s requests in lines 27b, 28b, and 30 (note the verbs: qabû twice
and šâmu). Unlike the previous example, this prayer does not conclude with a
promise of praise.
As Lambert has noted, both of these dingirshadibba-prayers are known to
have been used in specific ritual complexes. KAR 90, rev. 4 cites the incipit of
our first prayer (among eight other cited incipits) in the course of the ritual it
calls “my god I did not know” (nēpeši ilī ul īde, 269), and both prayers’ incipits
are cited in the first tablet of the ritual series Bīt rimki (in Zimmern, BBR, no. 26
v 81; see Lambert, 268).434E SSENTIAL B IBLIOGRAPHY :

Margaret Jaques at the University of Zurich is publishing a fuller edition and study of the ding-
irshadibba-prayers with their rituals. She also addresses their reception history and reuse.
1. ÉN DINGIR . MU
2. niš-ka kab-tu qa-liš [a]z-za-kar
ul i-de še-ret-[ka dan]-na-at
Line 1: ÉN = šiptu, “incantation, ritual wording,” indicates to the user of the tablet
that a prayer or incantation follows. It is not part of the prayer proper. DINGIR = ilu, “god.”
MU = 1cs pronominal suffix, “my.” Unlike the shuilla-prayers, the invocation in ding-
irshadibba-prayers is always short; they are typically limited to a vocative and perhaps an
epithet or two (contrast lines 18–19 in the second prayer). Edû, idû, “to know.” The suppli-
cant admits ignorance several times in the course of the prayer (see lines 6 and 7). Šērtu,
“guilt, punishment.” Danānu, “to be(come) strong.”
šiptu: ilī ul īde šēretka dannat
Line 2: Nīšu, literally, “life,” but idiomatically “oath.” Kabtu, “heavy, grave, im-
portant.” Qalliš, “lightly, slightly,” seems in this context to denote a lack of respect for the
deity invoked, which brings the traditional language of the Decalogue to mind: “in vain.”
Zakāru, “to speak, to name, to invoke,” with nīšu, “to swear an oath” (lit. “to invoke the
life [nīšu] of” a deity, king, or someone). The 2ms pronominal suffix in our line replaces
the expected ili, “god,” because the supplicant is addressing the one on whom they have
sworn. See CAD Z, 19–20 for the idiom. The verb may look like an N stem (azzakkar), but
a passive would not make sense in this context. Rather, the verb can be either a G perfect
(azzakar) or Gtn preterite (azzakkar; see also lines 3a, 4, and 5 but note the simple preter-
ite in line 3b). One’s decision about these verbs will affect one’s translation and under-𒌋𒌋 𒐊 D INGIRSHADIBBAS TO P ERSONAL D EITIES

standing of the nature of the supplicant’s sin. (Previous translations vary. See, e.g., Foster,
722, who reads perfects throughout, and Seux, 203, who reads a perfect in line 2 but Gtn
preterites in lines 3–5.) The –zz– is a result of the assimilation of the infixed –t– to the
sibiliant (z) first radical of the root. The line is a stock phrase found elsewhere (Lambert,
294). See, e.g., line 87 in Lambert’s edition of the dingirshadibba-prayers (278) and Ludlul
II 22.
nīška kabtu qalliš azzakkar
Line 3: Mû, “divine decree, cultic ordinance, cosmic rule,” comes from the Sumerian
word me (see Gertrud Farber-Flügge, Der Mythos “Inanna und Enki” unter besonderer
Berücksichtigung der Liste der m e . [Studi Pohl 10; Rome: Biblical Institute Press, 1973],
116–64). Mêšu, “to disregard, to neglect” (see CAD M/2, 41–42 for other examples of this
verb with reference to the gods). Magal, “(very) much, exceedingly,” also appears in lines
5 and 6. CAD M/1, 31 notes that this word, when it is used in SB Akkadian, typically oc-
curs several times in the context. Alāku, “to go.” Given the other verbs in context (and
depending on one’s decision about them), one might expect a perfect here rather than the
preterite. A Gtn form of the verb would not make sense in this context, “I walked about all
the time” (see CAD M/1, 29 for attestations). The last half of the line seems to be a meta-
phorical restatement of the first. (For another use of magal with alāku in the dingirshadib-
ba-prayers, see Lambert, 280, line 127: magal allak.)
mêka amtēš magal allik
Line 4: Šipru, “task, work, product, mission, message, action, affliction.” The context
does not allow an easy decision about this word’s precise meaning here. Danna/ātu has a
spectrum of meanings in the semantic domain of “hard, difficult.” Meanings range through
“difficulty, distress, famine,” “fortified place,” “foundation,” “binding (agreement),” and
“strict or harsh (words),” among other, more technical meanings (see CAD D, 87–91 and
CDA, 56). The meaning of the last word in the line, certainly a 1cs verb, is unclear. AHw,
1208, s.v. šeʾēru suggests the verb might be a denominative from šeʾru, “pock-marked.” But
this suggestion does not provide a sensible translation in our context. CAD Š/2, 259 does
not give a meaning, but it may be significant for other interpretive decisions in our context
that the one unbroken attestation of the verb occurs in the Gtn stem. Foster guesses the
verb means “I skirted” (722). Without a clear meaning for the verb, it is difficult to know
how to translate the other two, rather general terms in the line. My translation therefore
must be considered very tentative. In any case, given the surrounding lines, we may as-
sume the line conveys a negative act committed by the supplicant.
šipirka ina dannati ašteʾʾer
Line 5: Itû, “boundary, border.” Etēqu, “to cross over, to pass through.” Idiomatically,
itâ etēqu means “to trespass, to transgress.”

Line 6: See line 1 for ul īde, which occurs again in line 7. The partially preserved AN
sign allows us to infer that the last part of this line also begins with a 1cs verb (as in lines
2–5). But no likely restorations have been suggested.
ul īdē-ma magal an[. . .
Line 7: Mâdu, “to be(come) many, to be(come) numerous.” The form is a 3mp predic-
ative. Arnu, “guilt, fault, sin.” Ēma, usually means “wherever,” but in our context it seems
to mean “what.” Epēšu, “to do.” The 1cs verb ēpušu ends with the subjunctive –u because it
is in a relative clause (starting with ēma). The verb īde is formally a preterite but context
must determine its tense. (There is no durative form.)
mādū arnūya ēma ēpušu ul īde
Line 8: The petition section of the prayer begins with the repetition of the invocation
(ilī, “my god”) and a series of imperatives. Pasāsu, “to cancel, to annul.” We expect a ms
impv. here (as with the following two verbs); thus, pusus. Three MSS inexplicably read the
fs impv., pussī, instead. The two MSS , however, that we are following, add the ventive to a
ms impv.: pussa. Paṭāru, “to loosen, to undo, to release.” Pašāru, “to loosen, to undo, to
release.” Both pašāru and paṭāru (less often pasāsu) are used in contexts dealing with the
forgiveness of sins or the release from sickness/demonic oppression (CAD P, 219, 237–39,
290–92). Kiṣru is literally a “knot, bond, lump,” but it is often used with libbu as a meta-
phor for anger. Libbu is literally the “heart,” but it also means “seat of emotions and/or
volition.” The anger of the deity must be assuaged before the supplicant can ask for any-
thing further (see lines 9 and 10).
ilī pussa puṭur pušur kiṣir libbīka
Line 9: The supplicant asks the deity here to mêšu their sins just as the supplicant had
done with the deity’s ordinances in line 3. Gillatu, “sin, sacrilege.” Leqû, “to take, to re-
ceive.” Unnīnu, “prayer, petition.” This line encapsulates the desires of the supplicant in
terms of negative and positive acts: the deity’s forgetting (–) of the supplicants past acts (–)
and the deity’s acceptance (+) of the present plea (+).
mēša gillātīya liqe unnīnīya
Line 10: Šakānu, “to place, to set, to put.” With ana the verb means “to turn X (the
verb’s object) into (ana) Y.” Ḫīṭu, “error, sin, crime.” Damqu, “good, favor, virtue.” The
supplicant now asks for the past sins to be transformed into virtues, rather than simply
disregarded, as in line 9.

Line 11: The text harks back to the opening line of the prayer with the words dannat
and šēretka. But now the words are distributed across the two halves of the line rather than
placed together, as in line 1. ŠU = qātu, “hand;” ŠU . II indicates both hands (see lines 12
and 14). Amāru, “to see,” but can also mean “to experience.”
dannat qātka ātamar šēretka
Line 12: Palāḫu, “to fear, to reverence.” d 15 = ištaru, “goddess.” “God and goddess,”
as one might suppose, often appear together in Akkadian prayers and rituals and can be
treated as one grammatical unit. Pāliḫ is bound to both genitives. The idiom ina qātīya
amāru, literally, “to see in or by my hands,” means “to learn from.” The volitional form of
the verb changes to a precative since a third party (not the deity) is in view. The idea con-
tained in this line is also expressed in Ludlul III, line p.
lā pāliḫ ilīšu u ištarīšu ina qātīya līmur
Line 13: The supplicant calls on the god (see also lines 1 and 8) and the goddess (here
for the first time). They direct a nearly synonymous petition in the form of a command
(impv.) at each one individually. Salāmu, “to be(come) at peace, to be(come) reconciled.”
Our text follows Lambert’s MS A here (si-lim). Napšarī is an N-stem fs impv. from pašāru
(see line 8).
ilī silim ištarī napširī
Line 14: The supplicant now addresses the personal deities as a unit, again with an
impv. Tēnīnu, “prayer, supplication” (see CAD T, 343), is better than CDA’s “weeping,
lamentation” (404). Nīšu, “lifting,” is to be distinguished from the homonym in line 2.
Here we see the up-lifted hands as a gesture for prayer. Suḫḫuru (D of saḫāru), “to turn
(away, toward).” Pānu, “face.” One might experiment with more idiomatic renderings of
the line. What does it mean to ask someone to turn their face toward a person in a time of
need?
ana tēnīn nīš qātīya suḫḫirā pānīkunu
Line 15: Aggu, “Furious.” The adjective precedes the noun that it modifies, libbu. This
is not unusual in Akkadian poetic texts. Nâḫu, “to be at rest, to calm down, to relent.” The
verb is 3fp. The subject, libbakunu, is grammatically singular but must be taken as a collec-
tive, as the 2mp pronominal suffix suggests. See likewise kabattakunu in line 16. Lambert’s
MS K reads libbaka (note the 2ms suffix) in the first half of the line and then adds ištaru
zenītu silmī ( SILIM -me) ittīya, “O angry goddess, be at peace with me”; see line 21 below.

Line 16: The N-stem of pašāru is also used in line 13. Kabattu, literally, “liver,” often
has the sense of “mood, temperament,” especially in a context that also attests libbu. SILIM
= salīmu, “peace, reconciliation, favor.” For šakānu, see line 10. Here the verb must mean
something like “order, grant.” Lines 15 and 16a utilize the precative, as they express wish-
es about the deities’ moods and attitudes. Line 16b returns to the dominating imperative
(see lines 8, 9, 10, 13, and 14).
lippašrā kabattakunu salīmu šuknāni
Line 17: Ša lā, “without.” Mašû, “to forget.” Dalīlū, “praises.” Šitammuru (Gtn of
šamāru), “to praise, to extol (constantly ?).” See CAD Š/1, 297–98 for the slippage between
the Gt and Gtn forms. UN . MEŠ = nišū (f), “people, populace.” DAGAL = rapšu (m), rapaštu
(f), “wide.” On an interesting twist to the common “promise of praise” formula at the end
of many Akkadian prayers, our text explicitly mentions not forgetting to fulfill the promise
and indicates that the praise will be public.
ša lā mašê dalīlīkunu luštammar ana nišī rapšāti
Line 18: The second incantation ( ÉN ) begins here. Bēlu, “lord.” Banû, “to build, cre-
ate.” MU = šumu, “name.” “To create someone’s name” means to engender them, to give
them existence. A prescriptive grammatical approach to the text might lead us to expect
bāni šumīya; that is, we might expect the participle to be bound to the genitive and not in
the nominative case. See likewise the second half of line 19. In SB Akkadian, however, a
participle from a III-weak root in construct with a following substantive often ends with –û
(see Brigitte R. M. Groneberg, Syntax, Morphologie und Stil der jungbabylonischen „hym-
nischen“ Literatur, 2 Vols. [Freiburger Altorientalische Studien 14/1–2; Stuttgart: Franz
Steiner Verlag, 1987], 1.95). The first two lines of this prayer begin with five epithets of
the personal god—more than usual for dingirshadibba-prayers. Each epithet directly and
personally relates to the supplicant. Compare the shuilla-prayers, where the epithets tend
to relate to the deity’s position within the pantheon or to the deity’s temple.
šiptu: ilī bēlī bānû šumīya
Line 19: Naṣāru, “to guard, to watch.” Napištu, “life.” Šubšû (Š of bašû), “to cause to
be, to create.” Mušabšû is a participle, parallel with the epithet at the beginning of the line
(nāṣir). NUMUN = zēru, “seed, progeny.” This prayer shows just how closely šumu
(“name”), napištu (“life”), and zēru (“seed”) were associated in ancient Mesopotamia.

Line 20: See line 15 above. In the prayer’s first petitions (lines 20 and 21), the suppli-
cant’s personal deities—god as well as goddess, in contrast to the prayer’s invocation in
lines 18 and 19—are invoked (again).

Line 21: Zenû (m), zenītu (f), “angry.” KI = itti, “with.”
ištaru zenītu silmī ittīya
Line 22: Mannu, “who.” Šubtu, “dwelling, seat.” In some MSS a new prayer starts with
this line, indicated by the rule line that comes before it (lacking in two MSS ). Though lack-
ing in the majority of the MSS , ÉN is partially present in one MS . See the introduction to the
prayer above. The (reprised) invocation is a simple vocative, ilī, “my god.” The question is
rhetorical, intended indirectly to place the supplicant within general human ignorance of
divine things.
mannu īde ilī šubatka
Line 23: Mazzāzu (manzāzu), “position, abode, location.” Ellu, “clear, clean, (ritually)
pure,” sometimes translated “holy.” Kummu, “cella, shrine, innermost room.” Matīma, “at
any time, ever, never.” Amrāku is an active stative (or, a “transitive parsāku construction,”
in Huehnergard’s grammar) from amāru (see line 11). Manzāzu and kummu further define
the more general term šubtu in line 22. Now the supplicant directly admits personal igno-
rance of the divine abode. Lines 22 and 23 move from the general to the particular in
terms of both the location of the deity and those ignorant of it. Both lines begin with the
same syllable, which binds the two together phonologically.
manzāzka ellu kummaka matīma ul amrāku
Line 24: Kīma ginâ, “constantly, always.” Šuʾduru (Š of adāru), “to cause annoyance,
to frighten;” the verb is used to convey something about mood or state of mind, such as
fright, despondency, or gloominess (see CAD A/1, 105). In contrast to the sublime divine
abode, the supplicant is in utter misery. Mêš, “where?” The final question in this line is not
so much rhetorical (as in line 1) as petitioning. But the supplicant is not actually interested
in where the deity has gone, of course; rather, the supplicant really wants to know why the
god is not nearby.

Line 25: Turru (D of târu), “to turn (a part of the body),” see CAD T, 273–75; with
kišādu, “neck,” as object, the verb means “to turn back, to relent” (see 275, with other
examples). The –a on the end of the imperative form is the ventive. Šabāsu, “to be angry,”
also has kišādu, the referent of the relative ša, as object (see CAD Š/1, 5), in which case the
idiom means “to turn away in anger.” UGU = eli, “against, on, upon.” The line, therefore,
means literally, “turn back your neck which you turned away in anger against me.” Like
the one preceding it, this line is both a description of the sufferer’s plight as well as a peti-
tion to change it, though the latter is foregrounded.
terra kišādka ša tašbusu elīya
Line 26: Suḫḫuru, (D of saḫāru), see line 14. Used with pānu, the verb can denote a
positive or negative action (see CAD S, 49–50). The ventive on the verb confirms what the
context requires, a turning toward. In parallel with line 25, the supplicant petitions the
deity for favor using the language of turning. KÙ = ellu (see line 23). The adjective again
precedes the noun that it modifies (see also line 15). Mākālû, “meal, food,” with reference
to a deity (note the genitive ili, which may be translated as an adjective here, “divine”)
means “offering.” Ulû šamni, “the best oil” (see AHw, 1411 and CDA, 421 s.v. ulû), is in
apposition to mākālê ili and defines the items presented in the offering. Here the text of the
prayer gives us a window onto the ritual action that accompanied it: the setting out of an
offering of choice oil.
suḫḫira pānīka ana elli mākālê ili ulû šamni
Line 27: Šaptā, “lips” (nom. dual). Ṭūbu, “goodness,” is the object of the transitive
verb maḫāru, “to receive.” Qabû, “to speak, to command.” Ešēru, “to be straight, to go
well, to be well, to prosper.” The first part of the line describes the result of the suppli-
cant’s petition for the deity to turn toward the offering in line 26: so he may receive it. The
end of the line, paralleling the syntax of imperative + precative of the previous two
phrases, shows what the supplicant wants (expects ?) in exchange for the offering: they
want a divine decree that will result in prosperity.
šaptāka ṭūba limḫurā qibī-ma lūšir
Line 28: Pû, “mouth.” TI . LA = balāṭu, “life, health, well-being.” The petition for a
divine decree (qibi) is repeated, though this time with a more direct request (imperative +
object rather than imperative + precative): the supplicant wants life. The deity’s mouth
becomes the instrument of action rather than the beneficiary of the supplicant’s offering
(i.e., the deity’s lips received the offering in line 27).

Line 29: Á = idu, “side, arm, strength.” Literally, ina idu means “on the side of,” but it
functions as a preposition meaning “from” and need not be translated literally (see CAD
I/J, 14). MUNUS . ḪUL = lemuttu, “wickedness, evil.” Šūtuqu (Š of etēqu), “to make X pass
by.” N of eṭēru, “to be rescued, to be saved.” The reading of the two verbs adopted here
comes from Lambert’s MS B (see 277, n.51). Itti, “with.” What does it mean to be rescued
“with” the deity? The deity’s renewed attention and presence will give protection to the
supplicant as they escape the evil that has beset them (see CAD E, 403, which explains the
preposition with “i.e., protected by”). The syntagm imperative + precative (as result)
returns in this line. The ina phrase at the head of our line grammatically parallels the one
in line 28 (ina + body part + modifier); semantically, however, the two are quite distinct.
The deity’s mouth was an instrument of salvation; the evil power is that from which the
supplicant needs saving.
ina idi lemutti šūtiqannī-ma lunneṭir ittīka
Line 30: Šâmu, “to decree, to appoint, to ordain.” Šīmtu, “fate, destiny.” The first two
words form a cognate accusative. Like line 28, the supplicant asks for life or health
(balāṭu). Here, however, the use of šâmu and its cognate šīmtu seems more emphatic.
šīmannī-ma šīmat balāṭi
Line 31: UD . MEŠ = umū, “days.” Urruku (D of arāku), “to lengthen.” Qâšu, “to give, to
grant.” The first phrase helps us understand the full meaning of balāṭu in this and the pre-
ceding lines. The supplicant is not only asking for health but also an extension of their
days. The prayer’s petitions are firmly rooted in the mortal life of the supplicant. They
wish that life to be longer.
ūmīya urrika balāṭa qīša
Line 32: The scribe inadvertently omitted the RU sign. This line is the rubric, that is,
it tells something about the classification of the preceding lines. In this case, the rubric
identifies the kind of prayers on the tablet. As is typical, the rubric is written in Sumerian.
It may be translated, “it is the wording for appeasing the angry heart of a god.”
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Before delving into a broader comparative point about the prayer’s form, I
first note a few parallels between the language of our Akkadian prayer and what
is found in the Hebrew Bible. First, the use of the phrase itâ etēqu in the sense of
“to trespass, to transgress” in line 5 is similar to the semantic range of the BH
root ‫עבר‬. I discuss this parallel on page 308. The phrase nāṣir napištīya, “the one
who guards my life,” in line 19 finds an etymological equivalent in BH ‫שׁ‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ֶ‫נ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫ֹצ‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ .
In Prov 24:12 we read about the deity as ‫ָך‬ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫פ‬ ְ ַ‫נ‬ ‫ר‬ ‫ֹצ‬ ֵ ‫נ‬ , “the one who guards your442life” (see Tawil, ALCBH, 244). Finally, in the second line of our prayer the sup-
plicant confesses “I repeatedly swore a solemn oath on your life in vain (lit.,
lightly)” (nīška kabtu qalliš azzakkar). Semantically, this is very close to the
Decalogue’s commandment about pronouncing (literally, lifting [‫)]נשׂא‬ 1 the di-
vine name ‫א‬ ְ‫ו‬ ‫שּׁ‬ ָ ‫ל‬,
“in a worthless or groundless manner, in vain” (Exod 20:7, Deut
5:11). 2 Although the biblical text does not explicitly mention swearing, the idi-
om “to lift a name” may have originally been its equivalent or, rather, a broader
action that subsumed it. In any case, earliest interpretations seem to have identi-
fied the commandment with a prohibition on swearing falsely. 3 These similari-
ties in language once again suggest the conceptual proximity of Mesopotamian
and ancient Israelite religious worldviews.
Shuilla-prayers typically begin with a long hymnic introduction, which, as
argued in the general introduction, is part of the formal greeting appropriate for
addressing a high god in the pantheon. We have seen how this formal greeting is
also reflected in some of the prayers of the Hebrew Bible on page 238. In con-
trast to shuillas, the dingirshadibba-prayers attest very brief invocations, some-
times as brief as one word, “my god” (ilī, see line 1). When epithets are used,
they are few and always reflect the personal nature of the relationship between
the personal god and the supplicant (see, e.g., lines 18–19). As I have argued
elsewhere, 4 one need not formally address one’s personal god in a dingirsha-
dibba as one would a high god in a shuilla because one is already on intimate,
informal terms with the personal deity. This same mode of brief and informal
address may be seen in the Psalter’s laments of the individual (3; 5; 6; 7; 13; 17;
22; 25; 26; 27:7–14; 28; 31; 35; 38; 39; 42; 43; 51; 54; 55; 56; 57; 59; 61; 63;
64; 69; 70; 71; 86; 88; 102; 109; 120; 130; 140; 141; 142; and 143). 5 In most
laments of the individual the invocation is simply ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ , “O Yahweh” (see, e.g.,
Pss 3:2 and 6:2), or ‫ים‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O God” (see, e.g., 43:1 and 51:3 in the Elohistic Psal-
ter). Other invocations are just as short, consisting of a single word (Ps 59:2,
‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O my god”), or only slightly longer with brief invocations in parallelism
with one another in the opening verse or two (see Pss 28:1, ‫י‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫צוּ‬ / ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ , “O Yah-
weh / my rock”; 70:2, ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ / ‫ים‬ ‫ה‬ ִ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O God / O Yahweh”; 25:1–2, ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ / ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ , “O
1
The BH use of ‫נשׂא‬ in the phrase ‫ם‬ ‫שׁ‬ ֵ ‫נשׂא‬, “to pronounce a name,” is similar to the Akkadian use
of the cognate verb našû in the phrase šipta/šuʾillakka našû, “to recite an incantation/a shuilla”
(see Tawil, ALCBH, 249–50 and CAD N/2, 108–9). An even closer equivalent to the Akkadian
phrase is BH’s ‫ה‬ ‫לּ‬ ָ ‫פ‬ ִ ‫תּ‬ ְ ‫נשׂא‬ in, e.g., 2 Kgs 19:4.

See HALOT, 1425–26. The word was not originally equivalent to “falsely,” though it was even-
tually understood in that way. See the next note.

Yahweh / my god”; and 130:1–2, ‫י‬ ָ‫נ‬ ֹ ‫ד‬ ‫א‬ ֲ / ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ , “O Yahweh / my lord”). The longest
invocations consist of only three words: Ps 5:2–3, which places ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ in parallel
with ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫אֹל‬ ֵ‫ו‬ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ , “my king and my god”; Ps 22:2–3, showing ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫א‬ ֵ , “my god, my
god,” in parallel with ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ , “O my god”; and Ps 88:2 and its questionable formu-
lation, ‫י‬ ‫ת‬ ִ ‫שׁוּע‬
ְ‫י‬ ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ֵ ‫ֹל‬ ‫א‬ ֱ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬, “O Yahweh, god of my salvation.” 6 In light of the similar
mode of address between the dingirshadibba-prayers and the laments of the in-
dividual and in light of what others have suggested about the familial Sitz im
Leben and personal content of the biblical laments of the individual, 7 it seems
reasonable to understand the Israelite deity addressed in these psalms as occupy-
ing a role akin to the Mesopotamian personal god.

An Ershaḫunga to Any God
C HARLES H ALTON
T HE D EITY A DDRESSED :
Unlike other prayers from Mesopotamia this prayer is not addressed to a
specific, named deity. This suggests the petitioner did not know which god or
goddess they had offended, so they went to great lengths to frame the supplica-
tion in an inclusive manner. For instance, almost every plea is repeated in order
to include both genders, and the petitioner even included supplications to ac-
count for an unknown deity. Although the petitioner did not direct their prayer
to a specific deity, the prayer was nonetheless intended for the particular god or
goddess that was offended. Early translations of this prayer, such as in ANET,
titled it “Prayer to Every God,” as if the plea was directed at every deity. How-
ever, as Morton Smith rightly observes,
The composition entitled “Prayer to Every God” should have been entitled “Prayer to
Any God”—it is not addressed “to all gods in general,” [Smith refers to the introduc-
tion to this prayer in ANET], but to that one god or goddess whom the petitioner sup-
poses to be punishing him or her and it is significant that the petitioner takes it for
granted that this unknown deity is singular. 1
Since Smith’s critique, most editors have adopted the interpretation and title he
suggested.
T HE P RAYER :
The colophon of this text identifies it as an ershaḫunga-prayer, “lament for
appeasing the heart (of a deity).” 2 Generally, these prayers do not include a spe-
cific request such as relief from a disease or demon; instead, they seek reconcili-
ation with an angry deity. Furthermore, ershaḫunga-prayers avoid mentioning
particular sins or transgressions as the petitioner recounts a more generic confes-
sion.
A full picture of the rituals associated with the ershaḫunga-prayers is not
available, but a few details are known. In contrast to balags, ershemas and Su-

the ershaḫunga-prayers were made (epēšu), spoken (dabābu), recited (manû), and
lifted up (našû). 3 Even though ershaḫunga-prayers were not sung, kettledrums
often accompanied their recitation. Furthermore, ershaḫunga-prayers were recit-
ed along with other forms of laments and prayers during rituals such as for a
substitute king. 4 (See page 43 in the general introduction for more about er-
shaḫunga-prayers.)
Originally, the present prayer was composed in Sumerian, but at some point
most lines were furnished with an interlinear Akkadian translation, which will
be the focus of this treatment. A handful of lines or parts of lines were left un-
translated, but this primarily occurs in sentences that repeat something or con-
tain only a minor change from the previous line that was translated (such as
shifting the gender of the subject). In these cases, the scribe apparently assumed
the translation would be self-evident. I have filled in these assumed translations
with an approximated Akkadian text and placed them inside {braces}. The last
seven lines of the prayer appear only in Sumerian and do not follow the above
rationale. They are not analyzed in this treatment. 5
The prayer begins with what Maul has labeled the “type C” introductory lit-
any in which the supplicant seeks with a series of precatives to move the deity to
act on their behalf. 6 The first line of the prayer is one of the few petitions within
the bilingual section that is not repeated to a female deity. It should be seen as
an introductory statement summarizing the request that the deity be reconciled
to the petitioner. Lines 2–10 repeat the plea that the deity’s anger subside so
that the relationship may return to status quo and by implication alleviate what-
ever hardship the petitioner is suffering. Although lines 11–16 are broken, the
lament section of the prayer probably starts here and continues through line 38.
Based on the scant clues that remain in lines 11–16, the supplicant seems to
mention their sin and something related to a favorable name, a common Meso-
potamian concern. 7 In lines 17–20 the petitioner confesses deep anguish and
remorse concerning the sins that they committed in ignorance. They confess that

It may be interpretively significant that the end of the prayer consists of seven lines of untrans-
lated Sumerian since the number seven is central to the petitioner’s plea within this section:
My god, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
My goddess, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
Whichever god, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
Whichever goddess, though my sins are seven times seven, forgive my sins.
Forgive my sins, let me sing your praise.
As if you were my mother, let your heart be reconciled to me.
As if you were my mother or my father, let your heart be reconciled to me.

Foster, following Falkenstein (226), reasonably suggests lines 11–12 are a confession of igno-
rance of sin and lines 13–16 are a lament that neither god nor goddess called or pronounced the
supplicant’s name with favor (763).

their sins were many and great in lines 21–25. This confession is followed with a
series of four statements that assert the petitioner’s ignorance of the offence (26–
29). In line 30 the supplicant begins a description of the woes that have lead up
to the current plight. The supplicant starts with the initial anger of the deity
(lines 30–32) and then moves on to the bodily consequences of this anger (lines
33–34): the supplicant became sick. Lines 35–37 recount the supplicant’s at-
tempts to seek aid. But the futility of these attempts has left them in the current
condition of misery (line 38). Lines 39–46 are identified by Maul as a transition
between the lament and the petition section proper. 8 In these lines the suppli-
cant describes their current actions in turning to the deity for help. 9 Lines 47–55
comprise the petition section proper. A series of “how long” questions (lines 47–
50) are followed by the petitioner again reiterating their ignorance in commit-
ting the offence (lines 51–53). The petition section culminates with two final,
self-referential pleas (line 54–55). The last three lines of Akkadian (lines 56–58)
and the first four of the final seven lines in Sumerian (see n. 5 above) replace the
typical intercessory litany often found in ershaḫunga-prayers with a litany for
the removal of sin. 10 The fifth line of Sumerian transitions, with its mention of
praise, into the two-line conclusion formula (Maul’s Schlußformel), 11 which is the
final structural feature of an ershaḫunga-prayer.

šá be-lim nu-ug ! -gat
ŠÀ -šú
ana aš-ri-šú li-tu-ra
Line 1: The ša indicates possession (see libbīšu). Bēlu, “lord.” Nuggat, “wrath, anger,”
related to the verb agāgu, “to be angry” (see CAD A/1, 139–40), is in construct with ŠÀ =
libbu, “heart.” (See the commentary on this line in Maul, 244 for the reading ug ! .) The 3ms
pronominal suffix on libbu is resumptive, referring back to ša bēlim, “that of the lord.” The
phrase ana ašrīšu litūra literally means “may it return to its place.” Idiomatically, the
phrase means “to return to normal” (see CAD T, 255), which in this case means the suppli-4502. i-lum ša la i-du-ú {ana aš-ri-šú li-tu-ra}

cant wants the anger of the deity to subside and the deity’s disposition toward the peti-
tioner to return to status quo. Litūra is the precative form of the verb târu “to return,” with
a ventive suffix. The “anger” of a god is only mentioned in line 1 (in fact, the only time it
is the subject of the refrain’s verb, litūra). Lines 2–10 each simply identify a deity (or a
deity’s heart, as in lines 6–7). We should probably assume that these deities are also con-
sidered angry (see the next note and the restoration in lines 9–10). As indicated in the
introduction, line 1 is distinguished from the following lines, which are all paired to incor-
porate both genders. It provides a summary of the intent of the prayer: to placate the
god(dess).
ša bēlim nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 2: Ilum, “god.” Ša marks a relative clause. Lā is a negative particle used in sub-
ordinate clauses, questions, and prohibitions while ul is used in independent declarative
sentences. Edû (idû), “to know.” The form is a 1cs preterite, īde, with a subjunctive = īdû.
The petitioner begins the prayer by addressing the god and goddess that they do not know,
indicating their ignorance of the offence committed. Since the petitioner does not know
how or whom they offended, they must “cover the bases” and make sure to include every
possible deity. While the scribe left the second half of lines 2–7 and probably 9–10 blank,
ana ašrīšu/ašrīša litūra is implied (see line 8). The gender (and number) of the pronominal
suffix on ašru will vary according to the grammatical gender of the deity/item named in
subsequent lines.
ilum ša lā īdû ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 3: Ishtar, the goddess of love and war, was a major deity during the Neo-
Assyrian empire (see Tzvi Abusch, “Ishtar,” DDD, 452–56 and Black and Green, 108–9).
However, in this text ištar is used generically to indicate a “goddess.” This line begins a
typical construction seen in this prayer in which consecutive lines repeat the phrase with a
divine subject of the opposite gender.
ištar ša lā īdû ana ašrīša litūra
Line 4: Idû lā idû is rendered “known or unknown, i.e., whatever” according to CAD
I/J, 29b. Notice the assonance in the first half of the phrase as well as the fact that three of
the first four words contain two syllables providing a quickly moving rhythm.
ilum idû lā idû ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 5: There is no Akkadian translation of the Sumerian line, ama- d innin ì-zu nu-un-
zu ki-bi-šè; however, the assumed translation is easily provided since the only difference
between lines 4 and 5 is the shift in subject: from “god” to “goddess.”

Line 6: DINGIR = ilu, “god.” The sign IA marks the 1cs suffix and is a combination of
the I and A signs but is commonly normalized as ya (MesZL, #260). This line recalls the
petition in the first line; however, the pronouns have switched from third to first person
(though, the Sumerian version contains the 3ms suffix as seen in line 1). In lines 6 and 7
the petitioner addresses their own personal god/goddess.
libbi ilīya ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 7: As in line 5, there is no Akkadian translation of the Sumerian line, šà-ama-
innin-mu ki-bi-šè. The provided translation into Akkadian is based on the previous line.
libbi ištarīya ana ašrīšu litūra
d
Line 8: Litūrū is a 3mp precative form of târu, “to return.” Masculine plural nouns are
used to indicate mixed gender plurals as well as strictly male plurals. This line is unique in
that both genders are mentioned within the same line.
ilum u ištar ana ašrīšunu litūrū
Line 9: The reconstruction is based on line 32. Isbusu is a 3cs preterite from šabāsu
(sabāsu), “to be(come) angry” (see CAD Š/1, 4b–5a); the –u suffix is the subjunctive, mark-
ing this as the verb of the clause beginning with ša. This line is similar to the previous
lines; however, a verb marks the divine anger explicitly, assuming a correct reconstruction.
ilum ša elīya isbusu ana ašrīšu litūra
Line 10: This line is fragmentary, but presumably it is identical to the previous except
for the change of subject: from “god” to “goddess.”
ištar ša elīya isbusu ana ašrīša litūra
Line 17: The noun, akal (akalu), “bread, food,” is in the construct state and introduces
the relative clause that follows; this syntactical unit forms the object of the line’s main
verb (akālu). Uttû is a 3cs durative verb (with a subjunctive suffix) from (w)atû, “to find, to
be present.” Ramānīya is formed from the noun ramānu, “self,” with a 1cs suffix, yielding
“myself.” Ul negates (see the note on line 2) ākul which is the 1cs preterite form of akālu,
“to eat.” The petitioner tells the deity that they did not eat the food and drink “by them-
selves,” i.e., they did not neglect to invite the deity to be present and share the meal with
them (Maul, 245). This line marks the beginning of a new strophe. The subject changes45218. me-e ut-tu-[u ina ra-ma-ni-ia ul] áš-ti

from a god or goddess to the petitioner themselves. In this section (lines 17–25) the sup-
plicant highlights their grief and anxiety over this situation (17–18), asserts their igno-
rance in the hopes that the deity will show them mercy (19–20), and finally, admits that
their sins are many (21–25).
akal uttû ina ramānīya ul ākul
Line 18: Mû, “water.” Mê is the construct form. Šatû, “to drink.” The construction, mê
uttû, is similar to the first phrase of line 17, akal uttû. Like the previous line the petitioner
says that they invited the deity to be present and share in the meal.
mê uttû ina ramānīya ul ašti
Line 19: Ikkibu, “abomination, taboo.” See the note on line 17 for a discussion of the
construct form’s function here. CAD (I/J, 57) notes that the idiom formed with the verb
akālu, “to eat,” must not always be translated literally; however, this usage might be an
instance of wordplay. The two previous lines describe acts of eating and drinking while
lines 19 and 20 depict transgression in a more abstract manner. Line 19 links lines 20 and
21 with lines 17 and 18 and indicates that this section refers to the same event. The sup-
plicant admits guilt, which indicates a deterministic and retributive perspective regarding
evil and suffering. The petitioner believes that they “reap what they sow.” In other words,
since they are suffering they assume that they committed an offense of some kind. Howev-
er, they do not know for which sin they are suffering. Notice the assonance throughout
this line, which heightens the emotional impact.
ikkib ilīya ina lā idê ākul
Line 20: The use of anzil (construct of anzillu), “abomination, taboo, boundary” and
ukabbis (1cs preterite of kubbusu [D of kabāsu], “to tread”) is semantically equivalent to the
idiom in line 19. The supplicant again rephrases the same plea in order to get the god’s
attention and to make sure that every potentially offended deity is addressed.
anzil ištarīya ina lā idê ukabbis
Line 21: Annu (arnu), “guilt, misdeed.” Mâdu, “to be(come) much, many.” Rabû, “to
be(come) great.” Maʾdā (see CAD M/1, 24) and rabâ are both 3fp predicatives. (Compare
the attributive use of the feminine plural form of mādu [maʾdu] in line 58 with the predica-
tive used here.) Ḫiṭītu, “error, crime, sin”; the plural is ḫiṭâtu. This line is the first to men-
tion the quantity and severity of the petitioner’s offence. In addition to recognizing trans-
gression, the supplicant confesses the grave nature of it. Likely, since the sufferer is in
extreme discomfort (see lines 32–33) they assume that their transgression was proportion-
ally offensive to the deity.

Line 22: As in lines 5 and 7, lines 22–25 do not have an Akkadian translation. They
essentially repeat the lament of line 21, except the vocative there, bēlum, is replaced by the
supplicant’s personal god and goddess in lines 22–23 and “whichever” god and goddess in
lines 24–25.
ilī annūya maʾdā rabâ ḫiṭâtūya
Line 23: This line is identical to the previous one except for the change in gender for
the personal deity.

Line 24: This line continues the pattern of repeating the same address while replacing
the vocative at the beginning of the line.

Line 25: This line is identical to the previous one except for the change in gender for
“whichever” deity.
ištar idû lā idû annūya maʾdā rabâ ḫiṭâtūya
Line 26: Epēšu, “to do.” This form is a 1cs preterite with a subjunctive suffix. Lines
26–29 are similar in structure: the line begins with a noun in the construct state that in-
troduces a relative clause and is then followed by a 1cs preterite verb ending with a sub-
junctive suffix (see line 17). This syntactical construction forms the object of the main verb
(edû). Each line ends with ul īde, “I do not know.” The petitioner lists different synonyms
for “crime, sin, and taboo” in order to underscore the fact that they are completely igno-
rant of their offence.
anni ēpušu ul īde
Line 27: Ḫīṭu, “error, sin.” Compare this with the form in line 56. Ḫaṭû, “to commit an
error, crime, sin.” Aḫṭû is a 1cs preterite with a subjunctive suffix. The second half of this
line is supplied from the previous line according to the pattern of repeating a similar idea
with different terminology.

Line 30: Uggat is the construct form of uggatu, “rage, fury.” Nekelmû, “to glower, to
frown, to regard malevolently.” The preterite form here, ikkelmânni, has a ventive and 1cs
suffix (as do all the final verbs in lines 30–33). Lines 30–34 attribute the supplicant’s afflic-
tion to divine anger. This section begins merely stating that the deity is angry (30–31)
while lines 32–34 describe the supplicant’s condition as “sick” (marṣu), “burning” (ṣarāpu),
and “afflicted” (ašuštu), respectively.
bēlum ina uggat libbīšu ikkelmânni
Line 31: Uzzu, “anger.” Šumḫuru (Š of maḫāru), “to cause to confront.” The petitioner
presents their suffering as a product of divine confrontation. This line includes yet another
synonym for divine anger. In light of the nominative, bēlum, that begins line 30 we could
interpret i-lì as a so-called nominative absolute therefore translating this line as, “My
god—he had made me confront the anger of his heart.” However, the Sumerian, dingir
šag 4 šur 2 -ra-bi, speaks against this interpretation.
ili ina uzzi libbīšu ušamḫiranni
Line 32: Isbus-ma bears the enclitic –ma, “and,” which is used to join the line’s two
clauses together. Marṣiš (based on marṣu, “sick”) has the terminative-adverbial ending –iš
but is not to be confused with the adverb marṣiš, “bitterly.” Šūmû (Š of emû [ewûm]), when
used with –iš, means “to turn, change into” (see CAD E, 415). The deity’s anger is not
merely causing external duress but is even affecting the petitioner’s health.
ištar elīya isbus-ma marṣiš ušēmânni
Line 33: The beginning of lines 33–34 were left blank by the scribe. The translation
was apparently assumed. The assumed Akkadian translation is based on the Sumerian:
dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-zu. Ṣurrupu (D of ṣarāpu), “to burn.” Foster translates this verb idio-
matically (“excoriated me”) but ṣarāpu can also indicate physical pain such as a burning
sensation in the intestines and/or epigastrium (CAD Ṣ, 103). This reading fits better with
the previous line that says a goddess made the petitioner sick.

Line 34: The assumed Akkadian translation is based on the Sumerian: ama- d innin ì-zu
nu-un-zu. Ašuštu, “affliction, grief.” Iškuna is a 3cs preterite of šakānu with a ventive. This
line concludes the section that attributes the supplicant’s affliction to the unknown deity.
The nominative form, ašuštu, is an example of the fact that in Standard Babylonian the
nominative case ending often occurs where we expect an accusative.
ištar idû lā idû ašuštu iškuna
Line 35: Aštaneʾʾê-ma is a Gtn durative of šeʾû, “to seek out,” with an enclitic –ma. As
the supplicant is still lamenting their situation, the duratives in lines 35 and 37 should be
understood as referring to habitual action in the past. Mamman, “someone, somebody.”
The phrase qāta ṣabātu, lit. “to seize the hand,” is an idiom meaning “to help,” but it can
also mean “to lead” and possibly both connotations are meant here. The petitioner is alone
and without help because no one—not even a human much less a god—would guide them
as they searched for answers (see CAD Ṣ, 30–32). In lines 35–37 the supplicant claims that
no one responded to their cries for help. The laments build until line 38, where the peti-
tioner concludes the lament section of the prayer by describing their present state of mis-
ery.
aštaneʾʾê-ma mamman qātī ul iṣabbat
Line 36: Bakû, “to cry.” Itâtēya is the plural of itû, “boundary, environs,” with a 1cs
pronoun. Iṭḫû is a 3mp preterite of ṭeḫû, “to approach.” Not only would no one give the
petitioner guidance but they would not even come near them.
abkī-ma itâtēya ul iṭḫû
Line 37: Qubû, “lament.” Qabû, “to speak.” Šemû, “to hear.” This lament extends the
idea of the previous line—no one cared about the supplicant enough to listen to their suf-
fering let alone attempt to help them.
qubê aqabbi mamman ul išemmânni
Line 38: Uššušu, “distress, worry.” Katmu literally means “hidden,” but in the context
of this prayer the petitioner likely means that their plight is hidden from the gods; i.e.,
they are alone in their troubles with no one to help. In concert with the previous two lines,
this phrase could indicate the fact that other humans have abandoned them as well. The
–āku endings on the two substantives indicate the 1cs predicative. Naṭālu, “to see.”

Line 39: Rēmēnû, “merciful.” Attanasḫar is a Ntn durative of saḫāru, “to search con-
stantly.” Unnīnu, “prayer, petition.” To speak (qabû) a prayer or petition (unnīnu) to a di-
vine being is to implore them. The description of the god as “merciful” contains an implied
request that the deity act in accordance with this characteristic. Lines 39–46 comprise a
transition section between the lament and the petition section in which the supplicant
turns to the deity for help. The duratives should now be translated as referring to the pre-
sent.
ana ilīya rēmēnî attanasḫar unnīni aqabbi
Line 40: Šēpā is a dual form of šēpu, “foot.” Nuššuqu (D of našāqu), “to kiss.” The res-
toration in the middle of the line is suggested by the Sumerian mu-un-su-ub-su-ub; see
Maul, 239, 245 and Langdon, 42. Aptanaššil is a Gtn from pašālu, “to crawl.” The repeated
use of š heightens the emotional thrust of this line and possibly imitates a crawling sound.
The pronominal suffix on šēpāša is redundant with the ša at the head of the line.
ša ištarīya šēpāša unaššaq ina maḫrīki aptanaššil
Line 41: Nasḫuru (N of saḫāru), “to return, to show favorable attention, to repent.”
After an initial ana, the first half of line 41 is blank (an assumed translation) and most of
the rest of the line is broken. The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first
half of the line: dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-[zu . . .] (see likewise lines 42 and 44–46). The sec-
ond halves of lines 41–46 take their cue from Langdon’s conjectural restorations (42).
These are reasonable but quite uncertain. If the reconstruction is accurate, the supplicant
tries to get the deity’s attention with the use of direct imperatives here and in the next
several lines in order that the deity might pay attention to the supplicant’s plight.
ana ili idû lā idû nasḫiranni unnīni aqabbi
Line 42: Presumably, this line follows the pattern of repeating the previous plea with
a goddess as the subject. The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation: ama- d innin ì-zu
[nu-un-zu . . .].
ana ištar idû lā idû nasḫiranni unnīni aqabbi
Line 43: Lines 43 and 44 address a particular deity whereas lines 41–42 and 45–46
are addressed to “whichever god/goddess.” The Akkadian reconstruction of this line fol-
lows Langdon’s conjecture tentatively (42), but see Maul’s reservations, particularly con-
cerning the reading of the GUR sign (239, 246). Even if the reading of the GUR sign is
valid, it is doubtful that the Akkadian analogue would be saḫāru since there is only one𒌋𒐋 A N E RSHAHUNGA TO A NY G OD

Line 47: The phrase adi mati is composed of two particles: adi, “until,” and mati,
“when.” The phrase is typically rendered, “how long (until)?” With line 47 the prayer
begins the petition section (lines 47–55). After attempting to get the deity’s attention (lines
41–46), the petitioner now asks a series of “how long . . .” questions (lines 47–55).
adi mati ilī libbaka . . .
Line 48: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line:
me-en-na ama- d innin-mu. The second half is partially restored conjecturally by Maul (240).
Kabattu, “innards, liver, mind, mood,” is frequently found in parallelism with libbu (see

suffix.

me-en-na dìm-me-er ì-zu nu-un-zu. Linūḫ is a 3cs precative of nâhu, “to calm down, to
relent.”

Line 50: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation for the first half of the line:
me-en-na ama- d innin ì-zu nu-un-zu. Ahû, “foreign, different” (to be differentiated from aḫu,
which means, “side, arm”). In this line ahû describes the disposition of a goddess’s heart
that is not in its normal condition, i.e., it is estranged from the petitioner. This final ques-
tion in the series recalls the beginning of the prayer with the plea that the fury of the dei-
ty’s heart subside (see line 1: nuggat libbīšu ana ašrīšu litūra); however, in line 50 the peti-
tioner asks that the deity’s estranged heart might be reconciled (libbīšu aḫû ana ašrīšu litūr).
adi mati ištar idû lā idû libbīki aḫû ana ašrīšu litūr
Line 51: Amēlūtu (amīlūtu, awīlūtum), “humanity.” Sukkuku, “deaf, mentally handi-
capped,” is a 3fs predicative here. Mimma, “anything, something.” This line begins a sec-
tion in the petition (lines 51–55) in which the supplicant reiterates their ignorance in
committing the offence. They stress the finite nature of humanity—in comparison to the
gods, humans are deaf and unknowing. The supplicant implies that the deity should take
the human condition into consideration and provide them mercy.
amēlūtu sukkukat-ma mimma ul īde
Line 52: The Sumerian suggests the Akkadian translation of the line’s first word: nam-
lú-u 18 -lu. Mal(a), “all, as many as.” Mala / ša šuma nabû, is an idiom for “everything, eve-
ryone” (see CAD N/1, 35 for other examples with amēlūtu). Mīnu, “what?” The supplicant
has gone out of the way to describe the deity in multiple ways to include every contingen-
cy. In like manner, the supplicant says that no matter how humanity is described or what
terms are used for them, the results are the same—humans lack knowledge.
amēlūtu mal šumu nabû mīnu īde
Line 53: Gullulu (D), “to sin, to do wrong.” Dummuqu (D of damāqu), “to do good, to
make pleasant.” The syntagm, Lū . . . lū means, “either/whether . . . or” (CDA, 184 and
CAD L, 226–27). Not only should humanity not be held responsible for misdeeds due to
ignorance, similarly, good deeds are not meritorious.
lū ugallil lū udammiq mimma ul īde
Line 54: ÌR = ardu (wardum), “servant.” Sakāpu, “to repulse, to turn away” (see CAD
S, 73). Lines 54–55 present an emotionally compelling plea. The petitioner imagines them-
selves as stuck in a swamp and unable to extricate themselves—they must rely upon exter-
nal help. Therefore, the supplicant puts their well-being into the hands of the deity. For
the aradka-style and change of person from first to third, see Maul, 19.

Line 55: Rušumtu, “swamp.” Qassu is formed from the noun qātu, “hand,” and a 3ms
suffix. Nadi is a predicative from nadû, “to throw down, lay down.” See line 35 for the
idiom qāssu ṣabat.
ina mê rušumti nadi qāssu ṣabat
Line 56: Ḫiṭṭu = ḫīṭu, “error, sin.” For ḫaṭû, see line 27. Tēr is an imperative from
turru (D of târu), which means “to turn something into something else” when used with
ana (this text exhibits occasional Assyrianisms such as ēpuš and accordingly this word
could be read as ti 7 -ir > tīr). As mentioned in the introduction to the prayer, the last three
lines of Akkadian (lines 56–58) and the first four of the final seven lines in Sumerian (see
footnote 5 above) replace the typical intercessory litany often found in ershaḫunga-prayers
with a litany for the removal of sin. The fifth line of Sumerian transitions with its mention
of praise into the two-line conclusion formula (Maul’s Schlußformel), the final structural
feature of an ershaḫunga-prayer.
ḫiṭṭi aḫṭû ana damiqti tēr
Line 57: For annu, see line 21. Šāru, “wind.” We expect a subjunctive on the verb
ēpuš, as in the previous line, but it is lacking. Litbal is a precative from tabālu, “to carry off,
to take away,” a verb closely related to (w)abālu. In the last two lines the petitioner asks
that the sins they have repeatedly acknowledged throughout this prayer be carried away in
the wind and stripped off of their body. Misdeeds are not merely actions that disappear
with time but they are pictured as objects that stick to the offender.
anna ēpuš šāru litbal
Line 58: Gillatu, “sin, sacrilege,” is the object of the verb despite the nominative case
ending. Ṣubātu, “textile, garment.” Kīma, “as, like.” Šaḫātu, “to strip off, to cast off.”
gillātūya maʾdāti kīma ṣubāti šuḫuṭ

There are many constructions in the Prayer to Any God that have semantic
or lexical analogues to BH. The phrase in line 1, nuggat libbīšu, “anger of his
heart,” is semantically similar to several expressions in BH; however, instead of
using a bound phrase, Hebrew normally uses verbs with ‫ב‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ to indicate anger. 1
For example, Prov 19:3: “a man’s folly subverts his path and his heart rages
against Yahweh ( ‫בּוֹ‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫ף‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ְ‫ז‬ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫ל־‬ ‫ע‬ ַ )”; Ezek 32:9: “I will provoke the heart (‫י‬ ‫תּ‬ ִ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫כ‬ ְ ‫ה‬ ִ ְ‫ו‬
‫ב‬ ‫)ל‬
of many peoples when I bring (news) of your defeat among the nations”; and
Deut 19:6: “lest the redeemer lynch the killer when his heart burns (‫בוֹ‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ‫ל‬ ְ ‫ם‬ ‫ֵח‬ ַ ‫י‬ ).”
There are also a few lexical analogues. A BH analogue to the word sukkuku,
“deaf, mentally handicapped” (line 51), appears once albeit in a verbal form in
Deut 27:9: ‫ל‬ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ִ ‫ע‬ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫וּשׁ‬
‫ת‬ ‫כּ‬ ֵ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫ה‬,
“Silence! Listen, Israel!” 2
This prayer contains many sentiments that are similar to those found in bib-
lical prayers. For example, when Job brings his case against Yahweh he com-
mands, “take your hand and forearm far away from me—stop terrorizing me!”
(13:21). Although Job is more forceful and blunt than the petitioner of our Ak-
kadian prayer, both prayers share the view that the offended deity is bringing
trouble upon the supplicants. Job also asks Yahweh, “why are you hiding your
face from me and regarding me as your enemy?” (13:24). This question parallels
lines 35–39 of this prayer in which the petitioner says that they kept seeking
help but no one came to their aid. However, there are differences between Job
and Prayer to Any God. In contrast to Prayer to Any God, Job does not admit
guilt. In fact, Job maintains his innocence and challenges Yahweh to make his
offenses known (13:23).
Psalm 51 contains a humble confession of sin that is similar to the tone of
our prayer; however, the psalmist knows his offense (‫ע‬ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫א‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫א‬ ֲ ‫י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫)פ‬
and he is con-
tinually aware of his sin ( ‫יד‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ת‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫דּ‬ ִ ְ‫ג‬ ֶ‫נ‬ ‫י‬ ‫את‬
‫טּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ; v. 5), whereas our petitioner commit-
ted their offense in ignorance and they do not know what they did that offended
the deity (lines 19–20). The psalmist also implores God, “wash away my vice
and cleanse me from my sin” (‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ר‬ ֵ ‫ה‬ ֲ ‫ט‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫את‬
‫טּ‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫וּמ‬
‫י‬ ִ‫וֹנ‬ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫מ‬ ֵ ‫י‬ ִ‫נ‬ ‫ס‬ ֵ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫;כּ‬
v. 4), which parallels
lines 57–58 of Prayer to Any God. Lastly, Psalm 40:3 recounts a time when God
pulled the psalmist out of a pit of destruction (‫אוֹן‬ ‫שׁ‬ ָ ‫)בּוֹר‬ and the miry mud ( ‫יט‬ ‫ט‬ ִ
‫ן‬ ֵ‫ו‬ ָ‫יּ‬ ‫)ה‬,
which is similar to the imagery in line 55 where the supplicant is stranded
in swamp water (mê rušumti).
Finally, the anguish seen in Lamentations 1:16, 20–21 parallels that in
Prayer to Any God. In Lamentations 1:20 the lamenter describes his grief in
terms of distress (‫ר‬ ‫)צ‬,
a burning belly (‫רוּ‬ ‫מ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ַ ‫ח‬ ֳ ‫י‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫;מ‬
this is similar to the imagery
1
Tawil (ALCBH, 182, §37) translates the bound phrase ‫ז‬ ‫גּ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ַ ‫ב‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ in Deut 28:65 as “a raging heart”
under the gloss “furious, raging.” He links this with the Akkadian phrase libbu aggu/ezzu. How-
ever, ‫ז‬ ‫גּ‬ ָ ‫ר‬ ַ merely means “agitated quivering” and the context indicates that the phrase should be
rendered “fluttering heart,” referring to fear or anxiety instead of anger.

See Chaim Cohen, Biblical Hapax Legomena in the Light of Akkadian and Ugaritic (Missoula:
Scholars Press, 1978), 111:12.𒌋𒐋 A N E RSHAHUNGA TO A NY G OD

in line 33), and a heart doing somersaults (‫י‬ ‫בּ‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫ק‬ ִ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫בּ‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ִ ‫ְך‬ ‫פּ‬ ַ ‫ה‬ ְ ֶ‫)נ‬. Both texts try to get
the deity’s attention by underscoring the petitioner’s contrition. Furthermore,
the lamenter echoes the cry of Prayer to Any God in lines 35–38 in that no one
is present to give comfort (Lam 1:16, 21).

T HE P RAYER :
Tamitu-prayers are essentially long yes-or-no questions posed to the gods of
extispicy, Shamash and Adad. The answer was received via extispicy. As de-
scribed in the general introduction, after the invariable invocation and epithets
(see our line 1), tamitus are quite varied in their content but show a number of
common structural features, all or several of which may appear in any given
tamitu-prayer. Our prayer includes a formal presentation of the person for whom
the diviner is making the inquiry (lines 3–5a)—a guard responsible for a particu-
lar section of the city’s fields; an attempt to persuade the deities to respond via
flattery (line 5b); a stipulated term during which the inquiry was applicable
(lines 6–7); the question (lines 8–21), about which we will say more below; and
one technical qualification in the form of an ezib-clause (line 22). The prayer
does not include one of the endings identified in Lambert’s structural outline
(14).
The question comprises the majority of the text. It may be divided into three
parts, the last two of which are marked by a re-introduction of the person for
whom the diviner is inquiring (see lines 13 and 20). The first part (lines 8–12)
describes the potential preparations and attack of an enemy army. The second
(lines 13–18) describes what the enemy may potentially harm among that which
the concerned person is guarding. And the third part (lines 19–21) describes
how the person for whom the diviner is inquiring might be affected by the ene-
my’s potential actions.
The main MS used in Lambert’s edition of this prayer, ND 5492 (= IM
67692), was a compendium tablet that contained six tamitus. Its colophon indi-
cates that this tablet was Tablet VII of the Nimrud series of tamitus. Its copyist
was an exorcist, not a diviner, as one might expect.

3. ap-la-in-ni EN SÍG u TÚG . SÍG an-nu-ú
Line 1: The diviner opens with an invocation to the gods of extispicy. d UTU = Šamaš,
the sun god, god of justice. EN = bēlu, “lord.” Dīnu, “decision, judgment.” d IŠKUR = Adad, a
storm god. For Adad’s role in divination, see page 86. Bīru, “divination” (both the act of
extispicy and the answer received). The epithets bēl dīnim and bēl bīri are typical for Sha-
mash and Adad when they are invoked for divinatory purposes. See the OB ikribu-like
prayer on page 85 and the ikribu-prayers generally (see Zimmern, BBR, nos. 75–101 [pp.
190–219]).
Šamaš bēl dīnim Adad bēl bīri
Line 2: Ša, a relative pronoun (“who, which”), refers to both Shamash and Adad as
the object of the first verb, thus “whom.” Šâlu, “to ask.” The verb is a 1cs durative with a
2mp dative pronominal suffix. The pronominal suffix is resumptive. As the verb indicates,
the body of the text should be understood in an interrogatory mode. Annu, “consent, ap-
proval, ‘yes’.” Kīnu, “firm, reliable, true.” These last two words belong with the following
imperative; they describe the kind of answer the diviner is requesting the gods give him.
ša ašallūkunūši anna kīna
Line 3: Apālu, “to answer, to reply.” The verb is a cp impv. with a 1cs accusative
pronominal suffix. The phrase in lines 2–3b is only attested here on the Nimrud MS that
preserves this tamitu. The other five tamitus in this Nimrud compendium move directly
into the identification of the person for whom the diviner is inquiring or into the stipulat-
ed term. SÍG can be read as both šīpātu, “wool,” or šārtu, “hair.” TÚG . SÍG = sissiktu, “hem,
fringe.” Lambert argues that the phrase SÍG u TÚG . SÍG may have originally been understood
as “hair and fringe,” offering OB and MB parallels for support; but such an understanding,
he notes, leaves the ms annû, “this,” unexplained since we expect a fs, annītu. Thus, he
suggests that although the phrase originally meant “hair and fringe” it was misunderstood
in the MB period, when scribes read the first SÍG as šipātu, “wool,” and took the phrase as a
hendiadys: “wool and fringe” = “woolen fringe” (see Lambert, 15–17). In any case, the
item(s) referred to by the phrase is to be understood conceptually as a metonymic substi-𒌋𒌋𒐌 A T AMITU TO S HAMASH AND A DAD

tute for its owner. Lines 3–5 introduce this owner, for whom the diviner is making the
divinatory inquiry, as one on guard duty in the fields, which were outside the city walls.
aplāʾinni bēl šipāti u sissikti annû
Line 4: TA = ištu, “from.” A . ŠÀ = eqlu, “field.” NENNI = annanna, “so-and-so.” Usually
used as a placeholder for the supplicant’s name, in this case annanna stands for the par-
ticular field being guarded by the person introduced in line 3. EN = adi, “until, as far as.”
ša ištu eqli annanna adi eqli annanna
Line 5: EN . NUN = maṣṣartu, “watch.” Naṣāru, “to guard, to watch, to protect.” The
verb is 3cs durative. The –u on the end is the subjunctive (due to the ša in line 4). The verb
and its object require an idiomatic rather than literal translation. DINGIR -ut-ku-nu =
ilūtkunu, “your divinity.” GAL -tum = rabītum (fs), “great.” In a parenthetical expression in
the second half of this line and the first word of the next the diviner flatters the gods’ su-
perior knowledge.
maṣṣarta inaṣṣaru ilūtkunu rabītum
Line 6: ZU = edû (idû), “to know.” The form īdû, although formally preterite, has no
tense. One must provide it from context. Ūmu, “day.” NE = annû, “this.” Idiomatically, ūme
annî means “today.” The day of the actual inquiry marks the start of the inquiry’s stipulat-
ed term (often called adannu in Akk., see line 22), that is, the time period during which
the divinatory action is applicable. The duration is indicated in the next line. DÙ -ti =
nēpeštu, “activity, procedure, ritual performance.” Bārûtu, “divination.” The diviner speci-
fies how he will discover the answer to his inquiry.
īdû ištu ūme annî nēpešti bārûti
Line 7: UD . 30 . KÁM = the 30 th day of the month. ITI = arḫu (warḫum), “month.” The
stipulated term is less than a month (see also line 22). UD . NÁ . A = bibbulu (bubbulu), “the
day of the disappearance of the moon.” A lunar month is usually 28 or 29 days. The day of
the moon’s disappearance would mark the end of the previous month and the beginning of
the next.

Line 8: ÉRIN = ummānu, “army, troops.” KÚR = nakru, “foreign, strange; enemy” In its
substantival usage, as here, nakru refers to enemies. Mala, “as many as, as much as.” Bašû,
“to be, to exist.” The form is predicative. Mala bašû means “as many as there are.” Qallu
(m), qallatu (f), “small, light.” As applied to an army, perhaps “light forces” (see CAD Q,
62). This line introduces the concern about which the diviner is inquiring for the person
introduced in lines 3–5. Ummān nakri is the subject of the verbs that follow in lines 9–20.468

Some of the verbs are 3cs and others are 3mp. Lines 8–12 describe the potential prepara-
tions and attack of the enemy.
ummān nakri mala bašû ištu qallati
Line 9: Kabittu, “main body, main forces of the army.” Lā, “not.” The following four
verbs describe the preparations an enemy army might make before an attack, which is
finally mentioned in line 12. The verb uštagappašū and the two morphologically similar
verbs in line 10 are difficult. Although probably to be derived from the Št stem, none of
these verbs is attested in this stem outside of the present text. Tentatively, šutagappušu (Št
of gapāšu) is understood here to mean “to cause oneself to be enlarged, swelled”(?). The
form is a 3mp durative, utilizing the long form of the durative typical of the Št lexical
(likewise with the verbs in line 10).
adi kabitti lā uštagappašū
Line 10: Šutapaḫḫuru (Št of paḫāru), “to cause oneself to be gathered in force”(?) (al-
ternatively, see CAD P, 32, whose analysis leaves the infixed –ta– unexplained). Šutadan-
nunu (Št of danānu), “to cause oneself to be strengthened”(?).
lā uštapaḫḫarū lā uštadannanū
Line 11: Rēṣu, “helper, ally” (see CAD R, 268–70). Tillatu, “reinforcement, support.”
= rašû, “to acquire, to gain.” Notice that the verb here and the one in the next line
are 3cs.
rēṣi u tillati lā iraššī-ma
TUKU
Line 12: Tību, “attack.” Šiḫṭu (šeḫṭu), “attack, raid.” Šakānu, “to put, to place,” but in
this context a more idiomatic rendering is required: “to make,” “to inflict,” etc. Notice the
ventive marker on the verb, indicating the action lies in the direction of the speaker.
tība šiḫṭa lā išakkanam-ma
Line 13: Ina usually means “in,” but “during” is contextually more appropriate. For
= maṣṣartu, see line 5. For the remainder of the line, see line 3. This line breaks
the rhythm of the previous few and begins a section (lines 13–18) that describes the possi-
ble results of the enemy’s attack. Notice that the person for whom the diviner is inquiring
is mentioned again here at a structural turning point in the inquiry.

Line 14: EDIN = ṣēru, “steppe, hinterland.” MÁŠ . ANŠE = būlu, “animals, livestock.” URU
= ālu, “city.” Šallatu, “booty.” The diviner inquires whether the enemy will inflict losses
(see lines 16–18 for the verbs) inside and outside of the city, that is, anywhere, so as to
affect the herds and the possessions of the person for whom the diviner is inquiring. Šallatu
is not limited to moveable property; it includes human captives or prisoners, too. This line
stands in parallel with line 15. Thus, the two specific nouns here stand in parallel to the
two that indicate generic quantity in line 15. All four nouns in the acc. case in lines 14–15,
būla, šallata, mīṣa, maʾda, comprise the grammatical objects of the verbs used in lines 16–
18.
ina ṣēri būla ina āli šallata
Line 15: The ina has the sense of “with respect to” here. Mīṣu (wīṣum, īṣu), “little,
few.” Maʾdu (mādu), “much, many, abundant, numerous.” The phrase ina mīṣi mīṣa ina
maʾdi maʾda (see the first word of the next line) specifies how much the enemy may take,
which depends on how much there is available for the taking. Lambert translates it, “little
where there is little, much where there is much” (33).
ina mīṣi mīṣa ina maʾdi
Line 16: The first word here belongs with the previous line. Lines 16–18 contain the
following syntagm: relative pronoun ša + inf. + durative verb, where the inf. and dura-
tive verb are from the same root. The ša plus inf. defines that which is potentially available
among the objects of the verbs to suffer from the action of the verbs, thus “they will not
kill livestock . . . booty . . . a little . . . a lot, which can be killed, will they?” This is the
meaning of Lambert’s “as appropriate” (33).
maʾda ša dâku lā idukkū
Line 17: Ḫabātu, “to rob, to plunder.”
ša ḫabāti lā iḫabbatū
Line 18: Šalālu, “to carry off, to plunder.”
ša šalāli lā išallalū
Line 19: This line begins the last section of the inquiry; it centers on the potential
aftermath of the enemy’s raid. Bussurtu, “news, report, tidings,” does not necessarily desig-
nate good news, though that is its most common use. It is often bound to other nouns, such47020. ana EN SÍG u TÚG .s ÍG an-ni-i la ú-pa-as-s[a-ru]

as ḫadû, “joy,” dumqu, “favor,” or lumnu, “evil,” to specify its meaning (see CAD B, 346–47
for attestations). The noun is fem. pl. here. MUNUS . Ḫ UL = lemuttu, “evil, wickedness.”
u bussurāti ša lemutti
Line 20: The person for whom the diviner is inquiring appears yet again at this struc-
tural junction, the start of the last section of the inquiry, as one who might receive bad
news resulting from the enemy’s violent actions. Ana, “to, for.” Bussuru (pussuru), “to de-
liver, to send, to receive news.” Although often used for good news, the verb does not
necessarily have this connotation (see CAD B, 347–48).
ana bēl šipāti u sissikti annî upassurū
Line 21: Libbu, “heart.” GIG = marāṣu, “to be(come) sick.” Lemēnu, “to be(come) bad,
to fall into bad times.” Both verbs, however, when used with libbu as subject can mean “to
be(come) angry, displeased” (see CAD M, 274 and L, 117). Lambert therefore renders the
verbs as “be distressed or distraught.” Since libbu must be the subject of the verbs, the final
u on both are superfluous, perhaps added by dint of the fact that the verbs in lines 16–18,
20 end with the 3mp –ū. The query concludes with the potential reaction of the person for
whom the query is being made. There is no praise offered or promised to the deities in-
voked.
libbašu lā imarraṣ(u) lā ilammen(u)
Line 22: The only ezib-clause reinforces the stipulated term, adannu (adānu), “time
limit, fixed time, deadline” (see lines 6–7). Ezib is a ms impv. from ezēbu; the impv. means
“leave aside, ignore, disregard.” Ana arkat (warkat; = EGIR ), “after.” Ēribu, “entering, in-
coming,” refers here to the coming month, the one after the stipulated term during which
the inquiry was applicable. Presumably the person for whom the diviner was inquiring was
on guard duty for one month and only interested in that period of time.
ezib ana arkat adanni ša arḫi ēribi
Line 23: This line is the rubric to the text. It is not part of the diviner’s prayer. Tamītu,
“inquiry, oracle-inquiry” (see page 49). SILIM = šulmu, “well-being, peace, safety.”

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
The suggestions offered in the OB Prayer to the Gods of the Night (see page
79) supply a broad comparative view on the issue of extispicy and divination
and are relevant to developing a comparative perspective on this prayer, too.
The suggestions made here will focus on two particular issues: the use of binary
oracles and the BH equivalent of the term bussurtu.𒌋𒌋𒐌 A T AMITU TO S HAMASH AND A DAD
471
Although the present prayer involved extispicy to discover the will of the
gods, the format of the entire operation was essentially binary: the gods an-
swered a query by selecting one or the other possible reply, positive or negative.
Biblical narratives occasionally exhibit a binary oracular method in use. 1 For
example, in 1 Sam 14:9–14 Jonathan and his armor bearer contrive an either-or
situation to determine how they should engage an enemy they have encoun-
tered. If the enemy answers one way, the two men will stay where they are; if
the other, they will take it as a sign that Yahweh has given them victory and will
go up to fight the enemy. A similar oracle is invented by Gideon in Judg 6:37–40
with the use of a fleece. These are ad hoc oracles used by individuals.
The best biblical parallel to the institutional system used in the tamitu-
prayers is the official oracular means of the Levitical high priest (Deut 33:8), the
biblical Urim and Thummim, which was kept in the high priest’s ephod (Exod
28:30; Lev 8:8) and used to give guidance to the leader of the people (Num
27:21). Its binary format is suggested by the manner in which people framed
questions when inquiring of Yahweh in narrative contexts that suggest the Urim
and Thummim’s use. See, for example, 1 Sam 23:9–12 and 30:8. Perhaps the
best evidence for how the Urim and Thummim worked comes from the Greek
rendering of 1 Sam 14:41, a context in which the MT has become garbled: εἰ ἐν
ἐμοὶ ἤ ἐν Ιωναθαν τῷ υἱῷ μου ἡ ἀδικία, κύριε ὁ θεὸς Ισραηλ, δὸς δήλους · καὶ ἐὰν τάδε εἴπῃς
Ἐν τῷ λαῷ σου Ισραηλ, δὸς δὴ ὁσιότητα, “if the wrongdoing is in me or in Jonathan,
my son, O Yahweh, god of Israel, give Urim (lit., clear), but if you say, ‘(it is) in
your people Israel,’ give then Thummim (lit., holiness 2 ).’” Although not a yes-no
question, the framing of the question here suggests a binary opposition between
which the Urim and Thummim would be used to decide. 3 If we take the immedi-
ate context of this particular inquiry into consideration, it seems that the oracle
could sometimes be inconclusive (1 Sam 14:37; see also 1 Sam 28:6). The same
held true with Mesopotamian extispicy, which explains why we see the diviners
petition Shamash and Adad to give a sure reply (kittam šuknam) in the ikribu-
and associated prayers.
The Akk. term bussurtu, “news, report, tidings,” in line 19 is derived from
the same root as the verb bussuru (pussuru) in line 20. The BH cognates to these
are ‫ה‬ ‫ֹר‬ ָ ‫שׂ‬ ‫בּ‬ ְ and ‫בּשׂר‬, the latter of which, like the Akk. verb, is found only in the D
or piel stem (see Tawil, ALCBH, 61–62). The BH terms are quite similar in mean-
ing to the Akk. words. Both BH words can be used to describe goods news with
or without further modification (see HALOT, 163–64). Compare, for example, 2
Sam 18:19, where the context of the verse provides the clue that the news is
1
I leave aside the practice of casting lots, which may or may not have been binary in nature.
See Anne Marie Kitz, “The Hebrew Terminology of Lot Casting and Its Ancient Near Eastern
Context,” CBQ 62 (2000), 207–14 for a recent summary of what we know about the practice
(reference courtesy of Jeffrey Cooley).

The translator has probably read ‫ים‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫תּ‬ ָ rather than ‫ים‬ ‫מּ‬ ִ ‫תּ‬ ֻ here.

See Moshe Greenberg, “Urim and Thummim,” EJ 2 20:422–23.472considered good ( ‫יו‬ ‫ב‬ ָ ְ‫אֹי‬ ‫יַּד‬ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ְ‫י‬ ‫טוֹ‬ ‫פ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ ‫ך‬ ֶ‫ל‬ ‫מּ‬ ֶ ‫ת־ה‬
‫א‬ ֶ ‫ה‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שּׂ‬ ְ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫א‬ ֲ ַ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ה‬ ‫רוּצ‬
‫א‬ ָ , “let me run so I
can report to [‫ה‬ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫שּׂ‬ ְ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫]א‬
the king that Yahweh has delivered him from the hand of
his enemies”), 4 with v. 27, where David explicitly assumes the news is good on
the basis of the messenger ( ‫בוֹא‬ ָ‫י‬ ‫ה‬ ‫טוֹב‬
‫ה‬ ‫שׂוֹר‬
‫ל־בּ‬
‫א‬ ֶ ְ‫ו‬ ‫ה‬ ֶ‫ז‬ ‫ישׁ־טוֹב‬ ‫א‬ ִ ‫ְך‬ ‫ל‬ ֶ ‫מּ‬ ֶ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ‫אמ‬
ֹ ‫יּ‬ ַ‫ו‬ , “the king
said, ‘he is a good man, he will bring good news’”). 5
Since good news is not inherent in the meaning of the words, one will also
find attestations of these words for the delivery of bad news (determined from
context). For example, upon hearing the news of Israel’s defeat, the capture of
the ark, and the death of his sons from a messenger (‫ר‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ֵ ‫ב‬ ַ ‫מ‬,
lit. “one who bears
news”) in 1 Sam 4:17–18, Eli falls backwards, breaks his neck, and dies! 6 Jer
20:15 exemplifies well how the speaker’s attitude toward that which was report-
ed shaped its reception as good or bad news. Jeremiah curses the man who
brought news (‫ר‬ ‫שּׂ‬ ַ ‫)בּ‬
of Jeremiah’s birth to his father (Jer 20:15). What was in-
tended to be good news to the father is presented in an entirely negative light by
the despairing Jeremiah. Likewise holds for the news of the death of Saul. Da-
vid’s response to the news was anger—even killing the messenger of the sup-
posed good tidings(!)—and lamentation (2 Sam 1:1–16, read with 2 Sam 4:10),
whereas the Philistines cut off Saul’s head and sent it with his armor throughout
the land to herald the news of his defeat (1 Sam 31:9  1 Chron 10:9; compare
this to David’s poetic lament in 2 Sam 1:20). This last act finds an interesting
parallel in a Neo-Assyrian caption-inscription found on a relief. After the defeat
of the Elamite king Teumann, the officers in the field sent the Elamite king’s
head to Ashurbanipal to inform him of the good news (ana bussurat ḫadê). 7
4
See also vv. 31–32. But note v. 20, where Joab seems to believe the news will not be welcomed
by its intended audience (David) and tries to keep the messenger from going. For other contexts
that use our words without ‫טוֹב‬ to describe good news (determined from context) or to announce
something positive, see, e.g., 2 Kgs 7:9, Isa 40:9, 60:6, 61:1, Nah 2:1 (compare with Isa 52:7),
Pss 40:10, 68:12–14, and 96:2 ( 1 Chron 16:23).
5
See similarly 1 Kgs 1:42.
6
See David’s reaction to the news of Absalom’s death in 2 Sam 18:32–19:1. Although not attest-
ing the words under discussion, Gen 37:31–35 and Job 1:13–21 also illustrate the severe impact
of unexpected bad news upon its hearers.

A NB Royal Prayer to Nabu
A LAN L ENZI
N ABU :
See page 325.
T HE P RAYER :
Neo-Babylonian royal inscriptions typically conclude with a prayer, some-
times also called a blessing (Segenswunsch). The deity to whom the prayer is di-
rected is always chosen on the basis of the building project being commemorat-
ed in the inscription. In the present text Nabu is invoked by Nebuchadnezzar II
because the royal inscription commemorates his restoration of É-ur 5 -(me)-imin-
an-ki, “the house that gathers the seven (me’s) of heaven and earth,” the ziggu-
rat of Nabu’s E-zida temple in Borsippa. 1
The prayer is quite simple in structure. The first two lines contain an invo-
cation and four epithets. The remainder of the prayer consists of a series of peti-
tions (lines 3–16). Although several of the epithets in the opening two lines are
common, they seem to correspond rather closely with the petitions in the second
part of the prayer. The first and last of the four epithets, aplu kīnim, “true heir,”
and narām Marduk, “beloved of Marduk,” foreshadow Nebuchadnezzar’s petition
for Nabu to intercede with Marduk on his behalf (see lines 11–12). The second,
sukkallam ṣīri, “exalted vizier,” hints at Nabu’s role as divine scribe in the assem-
bly of the gods, mentioned in lines 8–10, and establishes him as one with official
access to commend the supplicant to Marduk (lines 13–16). The third epithet,
šitluṭu, “triumphant, pre-eminent one,” has martial overtones and connects to
Nebuchadnezzar’s request for dominance over his enemies in lines 6–7.
Lines 3–16 contain four petitions. The first petition, in lines 3–7, is the most
extensive. Based on his pious deeds (epšētūya, line 3), Nebuchadnezzar asks for
long life, a stable reign, and the defeat of his enemies as a gift (line 7). Lines 8–
10 repeat the request for long life but this time Nabu is asked to decree and in-

zations 5; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 1993), #1193.
475476scribe it on his true writing board (line 8). In a culture that knows well the pres-
tige and permanence of the written word, this request is more than a repetition
of the first petition. Nebuchadnezzar seems to be asking Nabu, the scribal god,
to put this particular gift “in writing,” that is, to make his long life official in the
heavenly accounts. In lines 11–13 Nebuchadnezzar asks Nabu to commend his
good deeds (epšētūya, which harks back to line 3) and decree his well-being be-
fore Marduk. As the high god’s son, Nabu would have had special access to the
figure head of the pantheon and would therefore have been a very powerful
intercessor. Lines 14–16, the final petition, provide the actual content, the spe-
cific words, Nabu is to speak while in Marduk’s presence: “Nebuchadnezzar is
indeed the king, the provider!”
Alongside the obvious theme of long life, one will note the predominance of
the written and spoken word throughout the prayer. As a king, Nebuchadnezzar
would have known very well the power of his own decree over his subjects and
the permanence of that which he put into writing. It seems this prayer is con-
structed on analogy to the king’s own power: it is hoped that a divine written
record and oral testimony would insure the fulfillment of the petitions.

Langdon’s edition is out-dated. His sign indices are often incorrect compared to modern usage.
I have adjusted these in consultation with the published copy of Langdon’s MS A, Norris I R 51,

Line 1: d Na-bi-um is an archaizing spelling for Nabû. After the invocation, the intro-
duction to the prayer consists of a string of epithets that hymn Nabu. IBILA = aplu, “son,
heir.” Kīnu, “true.” Here, the word denotes legitimacy, as in the “true heir.” Sukkallu (šuk-
kallu), “vizier, court official, minister.” Langdon’s edition omits the AL sign (see Norris I R
51, no. 1 ii 16). Ṣīru, “exalted, supreme, outstanding.” Case endings in NB Akkadian had
fallen out of use. The case endings as they appear in the text are basically irrelevant to
grammatical analysis.

Line 2: Šitluṭu, “triumphant, pre-eminent,” is an epithet used only for Nabu and Ni-

Line 3: Epištu, “work.” Epšētūya is the direct object of the verb in the next line. Ana,
“to, for.” Damiqtu, “favor, goodwill.” Ana damiqti as a prepositional phrase works adverbi-
ally, expressing the manner in which the supplicant wishes the god to look (see line 4)
upon his works. “Favorably” is a good English equivalent. Ḫadîš, “joyfully, happily.” Nebu-
chadnezzar bases his first petition (lines 3–7) on his good deeds.
epšētūya ana damiqti ḫadîš
Line 4: Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to see, to look upon.”

Line 5: Balāṭu, “life.” Da-rí-a is a pseudologogram for dārû, “eternal, lasting” (see
Hanspeter Schaudig, Die Inschriften Nabonids von Babylon und Kyros’ des Großen samt den in
ihrem Umfeld enstandenen Tendenzschriften: Textausgabe und Grammatik [AOAT 256; Mün-
ster: Ugarit-Verlag, 2001], 103). Šebû, “to be full, to be replete, to be satisfied with.” The
inf. is in construct with the following noun (see the same syntagm in line 6). Littūtu, “ex-
treme old age.” Lines 5, 6, and half of 7 contain the direct object of the verb in line 7.
balāṭam dārâ šebê littūtim
Line 6: Kūnu, “firmness.” GIŠ . GU . ZA = kussû, “throne, chair.” Labāru, “to be(come) old,
long-lasting.” Palû, “reign.” Labār palê means “long-lasting reign.” Šumqutu (Š of maqātu),
“to cause to fall, to cause someone’s downfall or ruin.” Nakru, nakiru means “strange, for-
eign,” but as a substantive, “enemy, foe.”

Line 7: Kašādu, “to reach, to arrive, to accomplish, to conquer.” MA . DA = mātu, “land,
country.” MA . DA , rather than KUR , is used frequently in NB royal inscriptions for mātu.
Ayyābu, “enemy.” Širiktu (šeriktu), “gift, present.” Šarāku, “to give, to bestow.” The impera-
tive bears a 1cs dative suffix, showing who is to be given the gift (namely, the supplicant,
Nebuchadnezzar).

Line 8: Ina, “on, in.” GIŠ . LI . U 5 . UM = lēʾu, “writing board.” Writing boards were flat
boards made of wood, ivory, lapis lazuli, gold, or silver which were covered with wax.
(Only the first two materials are attested among discovered artifacts.) The scribe would
inscribe a text into the wax, which could then be erased by heating. For the discovery,
restoration (including Agatha Christie’s role), and description of the 32 examples found at
Nimrud, see Joan and David Oates, Nimrud: An Assyrian Imperial City Revealed (London:
British School of Archaeology in Iraq, 2001), 97–99, 104 (fig. 62), and 219–20. Kunnu, “to
establish firmly, to define, to fix.” The participle modifies lēʾu. It is bound to the following
noun, pulukku, “boundary, limits.” As a scribal god, Nabu holds a writing board that has
power over the cosmos as well as individuals’ fates (see line 10).
ina lēʾīka mukīn puluk
Line 9: Šamû, “heavens.” U, “and.” Erṣetu, “earth.” In this common word pair, the
“earth” refers to the netherworld, forming a cosmic merism.
šamê u erṣetim
Line 10: Nabû, “to name, to decree.” Arāku, “to be long, to last long.” UD = ūmu,
“day.” Šaṭāru, “to write, to inscribe.” Lines 8–10 comprise the second petition. The two
imperatives with their objects are parallel, describing sequential action Nebuchadnezzar
wants the god to do on his behalf: he wants the god to pronounce long life and then in-
scribe that decree on his tablet.
ibi arāku ūmīya šuṭur littūtim
Line 11: (Ina) maḫar, “before, in the presence of, in front of someone.” LUGAL = šarru,
“king.”
maḫar Marduk šarri šamê u erṣetim
Line 12: Abu, “father.” Alādu, “to give birth to” (female subject), “to engender” (male
subject). Note that epšētūya harks back to line 3, where “my good deeds” formed the basis
of the first petition. Now in the third petition (lines 11–13) Nebuchadnezzar requests Nabu
to commend his good deeds to Marduk. Šumguru (Š of magāru), “to cause to be acceptable,
agreeable, to induce a deity to accept a prayer, pious deed” (on the latter meaning, see
CAD M/1, 42). The final vowel on the imperative, which we expect to be šumgir, is super-
fluous.
abi ālidīka epšētūya šumgir(i)
Line 13: Qabû, “to say, to speak, to command.” Dumqu, “favor, goodness.” Idiomati-
cally, dumqī (pl) qabû means “to decree one’s well-being” (see CDA, 62). Nebuchadnezzar
requests Nabu to give him general well-being. The two imperatives are again sequential:𒌋𒌋𒐍 A NB R OYAL P RAYER TO N ABU

he wants the god to commend Nebuchadnezzar’s good deeds and then decree his well-
being. Note the grammatical parallelism between the second and third petitions: a preposi-
tional phrase begins each (lines 8a, 11a); an epithet or two describing the item/person
identified in the prepositional phrase follows (lines 8b–9, 11b–12a, both including the
words šamê u erṣetim); then each conclude with two imperatives and their object (lines 10,
12b–13).
qibi dumqūya
Line 14: The last three lines of the prayer form its final petition. Lines 14–15 contain
the direct speech that the supplicant, in line 16, wishes to be placed in the mouth of the
god. d Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, “Nebuchadnezzar,” means “O Nabu, protect the eldest son!”
Kudurru in the sense of “eldest son” is almost exclusively used in proper names. See CDA,
165 (kudurru III) and CAD K, 497 (kudurru C).
Nabium-kudurri-uṣur
Line 15: Lū is a particle expressing a wish, “may it be, let it be,” or affirmation, “in-
deed, verily.” It is related to the precative. One’s translation will be determined by how
one understands the purpose of the deity’s direct speech (expressing the deity’s wish or the
deity’s asseveration) within the final petition of the prayer (line 16). Zāninānu, “provision-
er, provider” (only attested here), is related to the more common zāninu. See CAD Z, 45–
46. Note the lack of a case ending on the noun. Nebuchadnezzar’s role as king is directly
related to his ability to provide for his subjects.
lū šarru zāninān
Line 16: Naškunu (N of šakānu), “to be placed.” In keeping with the characteristics of
a petition, the verb is a precative. Pû, “mouth.” Nebuchadnezzar expresses the desire that
Nabu would utter the words in lines 14–15, apparently before Marduk.
liššakin ina pīka
C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Nebuchadnezzar’s first petition is a series of requests: for a long life, a stable
throne, an enduring reign, and the conquest of his enemies. These desires are
quite typical of ancient Near Eastern kings, including those in Israel and Judah
as depicted in the Hebrew Bible. An interesting example from the Bible is Solo-
mon in 1 Kgs 3. When given the opportunity to ask Yahweh for anything (v. 5),
Solomon chose wisdom to govern his people (vv. 7–9) rather than long life,480great wealth, or security from enemies. 1 His choice so pleased Yahweh that the
deity decided to grant Solomon all of the other things that he did not request
(see vv. 12–14). These additional gifts look very similar to what Nebuchadnezzar
requests in our prayer. Solomon’s choice may look somewhat distinctive upon
first glance, but it should be kept in mind that wisdom was often characterized
as a gift of the gods in descriptions of ancient Near Eastern kings.
The idea of a heavenly ledger, sometimes referred to as the tablet of destiny
and in line 8 of our prayer as “the true writing board, which establishes heaven
and netherworld,” is found throughout Mesopotamian literature and corresponds
to the Hebrew Bible’s heavenly scroll (‫ר‬ ‫פ‬ ֶ ‫)ס‬.
Shalom Paul has listed a great many
relevant texts from Mesopotamian literature as well as fourteen that name or
allude to the heavenly scroll in the Hebrew Bible (Exod 32:32–33, Isa 4:3,
34:16–17, 65:6, Jer 17:13, 22:30, Mal 3:16, Ps 40:8, 56:9, 87:6, 139:16, Dan
7:10, 10:21, and 12:1). 2 Despite the common mythological notion of a heavenly
ledger, the Hebrew Bible differs, as we would expect in light of its monotheistic
editing, in that there is no separate scribal god that serves Yahweh’s court. Ei-
ther Yahweh writes in this book himself (see, e.g., Exod 32:32–33) or some other
divine being must do it, though one is never actually named (see, e.g., Mal
3:16).

One might compare this request and its purpose to the characterization of Hammurabi in the
prologue and epilogue of his Code. See Martha Roth, Law Collections from Mesopotamia and Asia
Minor (2d ed.; SBLWAW 6; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997), 76–81, 133–40.

A Hymn to Marduk: Ludlul bēl nēmeqi I 1– 40
A LAN L ENZI
M ARDUK :
See page 291.
T HE H YMN :
The present hymn forms the introduction to a sophisticated literary poem
called Ludlul bēl nēmeqi, “I will praise the Lord of wisdom.” The lord in the title
is of course Marduk. The poem was written in four parts (“tablets”) of one hun-
dred-twenty lines each and comes down to us today on over four dozen tablets
and fragments in various conditions of preservation.
The opening hymn in Ludlul I 1–40 expatiates upon Marduk’s anger and
mercy. These contrasting attributes are praised thematically but the hymn also
sets up a serial relationship between the two, especially clear in lines 2 and 4:
Marduk’s wrath is followed by his mercy. We may read this expatiation as evi-
dence of divine caprice or a god’s twisted malevolence, but Shubshi-meshre-
Shakkan, the sufferer who speaks in the first person here (and speaks for the
poem’s anonymous author, we presume), apparently did not. Rather, the open-
ing hymn reflects this man’s personal experience of Marduk, which the rest of
the poem retrospectively recounts. The god who became angry with him—
precisely why remains unclear—inflicted suffering upon him both socially (Tab-
let I) and physically (Tablet II) and then subsequently healed his body (Tablet
III) and restored him to his previous social standing (Tablet IV). The poem ends
as it began: with praise for Marduk (see IV 120). Despite our modern objections,
therefore, Marduk, according to Ludlul, is not the divine equivalent of the cat
that toys with its mouse before devouring it. Rather, he is a deity that ultimately
shows mercy to frail and imperfect humans who have angered him. Shubshi-
meshre-Shakkan has experienced this mercy and is intent upon telling others
what Marduk has done for him (see line 39).
The hymn, like Ludlul as a whole, employs rare words, complex grammar,
and a sophisticated poetic style. Antithetical couplets dominate the hymn, a
483484handful of which comprise two four line strophes (see lines 9–12 and 29–32)
that recall Sumerian hymnic style. 1 But the hymn is also punctuated by lines that
do not conform to this dominant style. For example, lines 2, 4, 33, and 34 all
attest a semantic antithesis within their lines and lines 19–20 form a couplet with
synonymous parallelism (see also lines 39–40, possibly).
The hymn’s structure may be analyzed in various ways. For example, one
might see the placement of Marduk’s name as a structuring principle. It appears
in lines 3, 11, and 31, each of which is the third line of a four-line strophe (1–4,
9–12, and 29–32). But it is not clear how this informs our reading of the text,
since the segments thus delineated do not evince a clear thematic coherence or
progression.
Albertz has proposed a detailed structure in which a double frame (lines 1–
4, 29–36, 37–40) announces the theme of the hymn while the hymn’s core (lines
5–28) develops it. Lines 1 and 37–40 correspond in their use of the first person
voice and form the first, hortatory frame of the hymn. Lines 1–4 correspond to
lines 29–36 thematically and form the second frame, presenting the initial praise
for Marduk’s anger and relenting (lines 1–4) and his paramount position among
the gods with regard to the same (29–36). Only here, as noted above, does one
find both anger and mercy mentioned within the same line (lines 2, 4, 33, and
34). The core of the hymn, according to Albertz, may be divided into three equal
parts: lines 5–12, 13–20, and 21–28. Each of these develop the theme of Mar-
duk’s anger and relenting with regard to the deity’s character (lines 5–12) or the
impact of Marduk’s anger and relenting on humanity (lines 13–20 and 21–28).
Albertz sees each of these core parts breaking down further into two antithetical
couplets followed by a four line strophe (of varied structure: A, B, Aʹ, B, as in
lines 9–12, or A, B, C // D, as in lines 17–20 and 25–28 2 ). Although one may
balk at interpreting the final twelve lines of the hymn (nearly a third of it) as
part of its frame, Albertz’s analysis brings out several important features of the
text. Moreover, the remainder of the article shows how the introductory hymn
orients the interpretation of the entire poem.
Moran presents a much simpler structure. As he reads it, the hymn consists
of three parts, each of which starts with a 1cs precative verb. Part one begins in
line 1, two in line 37, and three in line 39. The first part he calls “objective, “for
it hymns the wrath and mercy of Marduk without specific reference to the
speaker.” The second part tells of the speaker’s experience; and the third “an-
nounces his intention to provide the people with instruction in the worship of
Marduk.” 3 Although one might hesitate to see three parts so distinguished, the
use of first person precatives at the beginning and then again only at the end of
the hymn is surely significant (as Albertz would affirm, too). On the one hand,
the absence of the first person from lines 2–36 practically hides the speaker for
1

3
This style is also evidenced in lines 1–4, but this strophe does not employ antithetical couplets.
His understanding of line 27 differs significantly from the text presented below.

most of the hymn and thereby emphasizes the hymn’s central concern, Marduk’s
character. On the other hand, despite its limited usage, the first person voice
turns the hymn into a testimonial account, and the precatives generate a perlo-
cutionary effect of exhortation and instruction—common in hymnic discourse.
Despite presenting Marduk as its prominent theme, therefore, the hymn is actu-
ally quite personal and intends to expand Marduk’s claim over the lives of those
who hear it.

1.
lud-lul EN né-me-qí DINGIR muš-[ta-lum]
Line 1: Dalālu, “to praise.” As many of the prayers in this volume have shown, the
1cs precative form of dalālu, ludlul, is frequently found in the closing line(s) of prayers as
part of the common “promise of praise” motif. Here the word ludlul opens the text and
marks its hymnic tone. The initial first person verb signals that the hymn is uttered by the
sufferer in the poem, a man named Shubshi-meshre-Shakkan (see III 44, IV 111, and IV
119). But the first person voice fades completely from view with the second word of the
line. The large majority of the remaining hymn is centered on describing and praising the
object of the initial verb, Marduk, the “lord of wisdom.” The first person voice only returns
in the hymn’s closing lines (I 37 and 39). EN = bēlu, “lord.” Nēmequ, “wisdom.” Bēl X is a
common construction in Akkadian. When referring to humans bēl can designate, among
other things, a person responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows, whether an
office, object, or something more abstract (see CAD B, 198; e.g., bēl šutummi, “steward of
the storehouse,” bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” or bēl dabābi, “adversary” [lit. “owner of a law-4862. e-ziz mu-ši mu-up-pa-šìr ur-ri

suit”]). Similarly with deities (see CAD B, 193). For example, Ea is called bēl pirištim, “lord
of the secret council,” in an OB text from Malgium. Bēl nēmeqi, “lord of wisdom,” here and
in line 3 identifies Marduk as the divine possessor and distributor of wisdom. DINGIR = ilu,
“god.” Muštālu, “thoughtful, deliberate, circumspect.” As mimation had disappeared in SB
Akkadian, one may also read the word as muš-ta-lu 4 . In any case, we expect an acc. case
here, since ilu muštālum is in apposition to the object of the verb, bēl nēmeqi. Muštālum is
also used to translate one of Marduk’s names in Enūma eliš VI 137 alongside eziz (see our
line 2). See also AN = d A-nu-um (Richard L. Litke, A Reconstruction of the Assyro-
Babylonian God-Lists, AN : d an-nu-um and AN : anu ša amēli [Texts from the Babylonian
Collection 3; New Haven: Yale Babylonian Collection, 1998], 90: 192).
ludlul bēl nēmeqi ilu muštālum
Line 2: Ezēzu, “to be(come) angry, to rage.” The form of the word is a 3ms predica-
tive. (Participles of stative verbs occur only rarely outside of proper names, see GAG
§85d.) Mūšu, “night.” Napšuru (N of pašāru), “to be released, to become reconciled, to
forgive.” Urru, “daybreak, day.” Note the use of the participle in parallel to the predicative
eziz. The alternation in this line between negative and positive attributes or images of the
deity sets the pattern for the remainder of the hymn, with only a few exceptions.
eziz mūši muppašir urri
Line 3: Adopting the typical Sumerian hymnic style, the opening couplet is repeated
nearly verbatim in lines 3–4. The major difference, of course, is that the deity’s name,
d
AMAR . UTU = Marduk, replaces the initial verb in line 1. This is a slight variation from the
norm. See lines 9–12. For similar uses of this hymnic form in prayers, see Mayer, UFBG, 40.
Marduk bēl nēmeqi ilu muštālum
Line 4: In a society that relied on oil lamps and the moon for light after sundown, the
night would be an apt association with negative emotions such as anger and fear. The first
light of dawn would have been a welcomed relief from the darkness.
eziz mūši muppašir urri
Line 5: The opening relative pronoun (ša) indicates the line is dependent on an earlier
noun, namely, Marduk. Since the subject of the nominal clause that follows, uggatu, “fury,
rage,” has a resumptive 3ms pronominal suffix on it (–šu, indicated in the writing as –su
since the cluster –tš– becomes –ss–), the relative particle is best translated as “whose.”
Kīma, “like, as.” UD = ūmu, “day,” but the word can also be read as the homonymous ūmu,
“storm,” often used to describe demons. Meḫû, “storm.” Based on equivalencies found in
lexical and bilingual texts (see the citations in AHw, 642, 1420 and CAD M/2, 4–5), it
seems most likely that ūmi meḫê in construct means something like “very violent storm.”
Namû, “steppe, deserted area, pasture lands.” Marduk’s anger is likened to a powerful
natural force that leaves destruction in its wake.

Line 6: U, “and.” Given the fact that the statements in lines 5 and 6 are antithetical,
one might translate the conjunction as an adversative, “but.” Kī (kî), “like, as.” Mānitu,
“breeze, gentle wind.” Šērtu, “morning,” pl. šērētu, “morning hours.” Zâqu, “to blow, to
waft, to gust.” The inf. is being used as a gerund here. Ṭābu, “sweet, good.” The adj. is 3ms
predicative (ṭāb) with the subjunctive –u (line 7 is still part of the relative clause begun in
line 6). Notice the grammatical parallelism between lines 5 and 6. In a land known for its
scorching temperatures, the morning breeze must have been an especially comfortable and
enjoyable part of the day, thus making it an apt simile for Marduk in a favorable mood.
u kī mānit šērēti zâqšu ṭābu
Line 7: Uzzu, “anger, rage.” The form includes the locative-adverbial suffix –um (=
ina) before the 3ms pronominal suffix (–šu); the m of the former has assimilated to the š of
latter (–mš– becomes –šš–). Maḫāru, “to confront, to face, to oppose.” Lā maḫār, a negated
inf. in the absolute form, literally means “not confronting,” thus “unstoppable, irresistible,
not opposable.” Abūbu, “flood,” is often used metaphorically to characterize the inexorable
power of a deity’s anger, a king’s military actions, or either’s weapons (see CAD A/1, 78–
79). Rūbu, “anger, turmoil, fury.” Juxtaposing the words abūbu and lā maḫār in this line
conveys the overwhelming power of Marduk’s anger. Like water breaking through a levee,
it cannot easily be stopped.
uzzuššu lā maḫār abūbu rūbšu
Line 8: Mussaḫḫiru, “merciful,” probably based on the Gtn participle of saḫāru, “to
turn back/towards someone with concern, favor,” is a 3ms predicative (note the lack of a
case ending). See CAD M/2, 235 (s.v. mussaḫru) for the one other known instance of this
word, also used predicatively. Karšu, lit. “stomach,” but here it means “mind, mood.” The
form of the word used with suffixes, karaš–, puts the final consonant adjacent to the š of
the 3ms pronominal suffix. The resulting –šš– becomes –ss–. Kabattu (also kabtatu, see line
36), lit. “liver,” but here it means “mood, temper, emotions.” Târu, “to return, to turn
back, to relent.” This form is also predicative (3fs).
mussaḫḫir karassu kabattašu târat
Line 9: Nakbatu, “weight, combat power, main force.” Qātu, “hand.” Nakbat qātīšu is
the object of the verb in this line. Našû, “to lift, to carry, to bear.” Šamāʾū (šamāmū),
“heavens,” is a poetic term synonymous with the more common šamû. Marduk’s over-
whelming power is unbearable even at the cosmic level.

Line 10: Rittu, “hand, palm.” The final vowel of the 3ms suffix has been elided. Com-
pare line 12. Rabbu (m), rabbatu (f), “soft, gentle.” Given the fact that two Assyrian MSS
read rabbat here ( MSS AA and ff, partially restored), it is probably best to understand rab-
bati, attested in two late Babylonian MSS ( MSS gg and ii), as a 3fs predicative with a super-
fluous vowel attached—not atypical in late manuscripts. Mītu means “dead.” “Dead” is
probably not to be understood here as the cessation of all bodily functions but as “mori-
bund, dying, as good as dead.” Kuššu (D of kâšu) is problematic. Formally, it is a 3cs dura-
tive with subjunctive. Semantically, however, one can take it to mean “to help” (CDA’s
kiāšu; CAD’s kâšu B) or “to delay” (CDA’s kâšu; CAD’s kâšu A). If one accepts the latter
verb, one must take the phrase to mean “it delays (the death of) the dying” (see, e.g., CAD
K, 295). If one accepts the former verb, one faces the problem that the CAD offers no cer-
tain attestations of this verb in the D stem (K, 295). This issue has been mollified slightly
by the fact that new material in Ludlul IV 26 (according to the line numbering of Annus
and Lenzi) does attest it in a broken line that occurs in a context of the sufferer recounting
his salvation: [ . . . ] ukaššu Zarpān[ītu], “whom Zarpanitu helps.” Given this attestation
and the fact that “help” or “rescue” makes contextual sense in line 10, this rendering
seems to be the most likely understanding of the verb (see likewise Foster, 395; George
and Al-Rawi, 194). Marduk, this line states, can also be tender and caring, rescuing those
destined for the grave.
rittuš rabbat(i) ukaššu mīta
Line 11: Lines 9–12 employ the Sumerian hymnic style by repeating a couplet, first
without the deity’s name and then with it. Unlike lines 1 and 3, which also employ this
literary form, the insertion of the deity’s name in line 11 does not replace a word in line 9.
This is the typical execution of the form.
Marduk ša nakbat qātīšu lā inaššû šamāʾū
Line 12: The line varies from its mate in line 10 in that the initial pair of words has
switched places. Notice also that the 3ms pronominal suffix on rittu shows its final vowel
in this line.
rabbat(i) rittušu ukaššu mīta
Line 13: Ina, “in, on, by, among, from,” is best understood here as “on account of.”
Libbātu, pl. “wrath, fury.” Putattû (Dt of petû), “to be opened.” Qabru, “grave.” The opening
(i.e., digging) of graves suggests the need to bury the dead, the apparent result of Marduk’s
anger.

Line 14: Inūšu (Assyrian, enūšu, rendered enuššu in MS ff from Nimrud, for which see
George and Al-Rawi, 197), “at that time, then.” Karašû (karāšu), “disaster, catastrophe.”
Generally, maqtu indicates a destitute person or a fugitive—one who has fallen through the
social safety net, so to speak (see CAD M/1, 254–55). Lines 13 and 14 indicate that many
people will die when Marduk is angry, but he also has mercy on the devastated survivors
of his wrath.
inūšu ina karašê ušatbi maqtu
Line 15: Nekelmû, “to frown at.” The form of the word is N 3cs durative. Nesû, “to
withdraw, to be distant.” Lamassu (= d LAMMA ) and šēdu (= d ALAD ) are anonymous tutelary
deities of individuals, temples, gates, or cities, who are, as line 16 shows, distinct from but
conceptually related to one’s personal god (ilu). Lamassu and šēdu, female and male respec-
tively, appear together frequently in inscriptions and texts (see CAD L, 63–64 and Š/2,
257–58). Lamassū are depicted in iconography as female deities in a human form leading
devotees before a seated god. Acquiring (rašû) a divine guardian is a stroke of good for-
tune for a person. One benefits from their divine protection as these deities walk at one’s
side (ida alāku, see Ludlul I 45) or go before and behind (pāni u arki alāku) their ward. But
when these agents of protection withdraw (nesû), leave (ezēbu), re-deploy themselves (šanâ
saḫāru, “to turn to another,” šanâ šeʾû, “to search for another”; see Ludlul I 46), get angry
(e.g., ezēzu), or the like, one is exposed to danger because the divine hedge of protection is
removed. In our line Marduk simply glowers and these protective agents dismiss them-
selves, leaving their ward open to harm. Clearly Marduk’s displeasure is enough to scare
off the lowly tutelary deities. Conversely, a mere glance of concern from Marduk as line 16
says, and one’s divine protectors return. The hierarchy of the divine world closely parallels
human social interaction: the human and divine kings’ decisions trump all lower-level
contracts or agreements. Even the terseness that relates Marduk’s mood in these lines
(ikkelemmû-ma and ippallas-ma) suggests he need only speak a single word and others
scramble to fall into line. This is precisely how one expects peons to behave under an abso-
lute ruler.
ikkelemmû-ma inessû lamassu u šēdu
Line 16: Naplusu (N of palāsu), “to see, to look at,” often though not exclusively im-
plies a benevolent intent. Ana begins a prepositional phrase in which a subordinate clause
(starting with ša) is embedded. Sakāpu, “to push away, to reject, to forsake.” The subject of
this verb must be the personal god, mentioned next in the line. The pronominal suffix on
this verb is resumptive, referring to the same person as does the initial ša, that is, the hu-
man ward of the god. There is some question, however, about the subject of the final verb
isaḫḫuršu, from saḫāru, “to turn (back) to, to show favor to.” Some take Marduk as the
subject (e.g., D. J. Wiseman, “A New Text of the Babylonian Poem of the Righteous Suffer-
er,” AnSt 30 [1980], 105; von Soden, TUAT III/1, 115, and W. Horowitz and W. G. Lam-
bert, “A New Exemplar of Ludlul Bēl Nēmeqi Tablet I from Birmingham,” Iraq 64 [2002],49017. ak-ṣa-at a-na sur-ri en-nit-ta-šú ka-bit-ti
18. ik-ka-riṭ-ma za-mar-ma i-tar a-lit-tuš
19. id-du-ud-ma ri-ma-šu ú-kan-ni
245), which is grammatically possible. If, however, one reads the previous line in parallel
with line 16, then a pattern emerges in which Marduk’s action is followed by the divine
protectors’ reaction. In this case, ilšu, “his god,” is the most likely subject of isaḫḫuršu (thus
the personal god is the subject of both verbs after the –ma). The pronominal suffix on the
verb is therefore 3ms dative (–šum, with the loss of the final m) and refers to the same
person as the ana ša phrase in the middle of the line (see likewise George and Al-Rawi,
197 and others listed there).
ippallas-ma ana ša iskipūšu ilšu isaḫḫuršu
Line 17: Akṣu, “dangerous, overbearing, terrible.” The adjective is a 3fs predicative.
Ana surri, “immediately, soon.” Ennettu (ennittu), “punishment.” Kabtu (m), kabittu (f),
“heavy, important, grave, grievous.” Marduk’s terrible wrath is quick to strike.
akṣat ana surri ennittašu kabitti
Line 18: Nakruṭu (N of karāṭu), “to be merciful, to show pity.” (This part of the hymn
was not known to CAD K [1971], 215 or N/1 [1980], 196. One may wish to add this refer-
ence.) Zamar, “quickly, immediately.” Târu, “to turn, to return, to turn into, to become.”
Several NB MSS read a final vowel on the verb here. As George and Al-Rawi explain on the
basis of a study in NB grammar (198), NB has a tendency to add such final vowels to dura-
tives of middle weak roots (sometimes in II-y roots and very often in II-w roots, like târu).
Ālittu, “mother, one who gives birth.” The š on the noun may be an apocopated 3ms suffix.
Or, as George and Al-Rawi believe, the –uš ending is a late form of the adverbial –iš and
ālittuš should be translated “like a mother” (see likewise Foster, 395). In either case, line
18 shows that Marduk in a merciful mood can quickly turn “motherly” toward humans.
The semantic contrast in the couplet of lines 17–18 is complemented by the phonological
similarities between them. Compare the k and t sounds in akṣat and ikkarriṭ, the sibiliant
(s, z) and r sounds in surri and zamar, and the t and š sounds in ennittašu kabitti and ālittuš.
ikkariṭ-ma zamar itâr alittuš
Line 19: Lines 19–20, as presently understood, break the pattern of alternating nega-
tive and positive images. Edēdu is difficult. All extant MSS read the verb as iddud, a G dura-
tive. Normally, the verb in the G stem means “to be(come) pointed.” But this makes no
sense in context. The D stem’s meaning, on the other hand, when in hendiadys (as our verb
seems to be with kunnû), is quite suitable to our context, “to do something quickly, to
hasten to” (see CAD E, 24; note the adverbs ana surri and zamar in lines 17 and 18). But
our verb is clearly a G stem. If, however, the alternative restoration of Ludlul II 81 is cor-
rect ([i]-du-ud), there may be another attestation of the G stem with the meaning “to has-
ten” (see Annus and Lenzi, xxvii, n.50, correcting the Akkadian there to [i]-du-ud, and
Moran, 260). Given this possibility and the propensity for our author to use rare verbs or
verbs in otherwise rarely attested stems (see Annus and Lenzi, xxvii), translating the G
with the D stem’s meaning “to hasten to” is the only reasonable and viable alternative at
present. Rîmu (reʾmu, CAD R, 259), “beloved.” Though it is a rarely attested word, it makes𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

better contextual sense than rīmu, “bull.” As Foster notes (395, n.2), rîmu, “beloved,” may
be punning on rīmu, “bull,” given the bovine references in line 20. MS gg personalizes this
noun with a 1cs pronominal suffix, “my beloved,” against MS ff’s 3ms suffix accepted here
(see the next line, too). But MS gg’s reading seems less satisfactory from a literary perspec-
tive. Kunnû (D of kanû), “to care for, to treat kindly.”
iddud-ma rîmašu ukanni
Line 20: Arḫu, “cow.” Būru, “calf.” In keeping with the “motherly” language of line
18, Marduk is compared to a cow with a calf. Arkīšu, “behind it/him.” In light of the
meaning of verb, the “him” is probably best understood as a reference to the cow/Marduk.
Itasḫuru (Ntn of saḫāru ), “to keep turning back/around, to be constantly in attendance.”
Ittanasḫara is a 3cs durative with the ventive. Just as a cow keeps turning around behind it
to look at its calf, so Marduk does to his ward. The variant in MS gg, arkīya, “behind me,”
does not fit this imagery. Instead, it would seem to be working with the analogy of a cow
turning around to get physically behind the calf, perhaps to direct it. The variants may
correspond to two different stages of cow behavior in relationship to her calf. “When the
calf is first born, the cow will nudge the calf from behind, encouraging it to walk. After
that, the calf follows the mother, and she will look back to check on it” (personal commu-
nication from Ms. Jauson King, a bovine expert). Moran notes that the “cow looking back,”
especially as the calf nurses, is a common motif in ancient Near Eastern art (“The Babylo-
nian Job,” in The Most Magic Words: Essays on Babylonian and Biblical Literature [ed. Ronald
S. Hendel; CBQMS 35; Washington, D.C.: Catholic Biblical Association of America, 2002],
194).
u kī araḫ būri ittanasḫara arkīšu
Line 21: Zaqtu, “pointed, barbed.” The adjective is a 3fp predicative. Niṭâtu, pl. “beat-
ings.” Saḫālu, “to prick, to pierce.” Zumru, “body.” MS gg, in keeping with its previous two
lines’ 1cs suffixes, preserves zumrī, “my body.” Lines 21 and 22 renew the antithetical
couplet pattern observed earlier in the hymn. Despite the semantic antithesis, the two lines
show very close grammatical parallelism (but note the alteration between feminine [line
21] and masculine [line 22] grammatical gender).
zaqtā niṭâtūšu usaḫḫalā zumra
Line 22: Pašḫu, “soothing, resting.” The adjective is a 3mp predicative. Ṣindu (ṣimdu),
“bandage.” Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), “to revive, to restore to health, to cure, to support.” Nam-
taru, “death, fate, (name of a demon).” The object of the verb is always the person receiv-
ing care, not the thing for which they need a cure. Since it is unlikely that Marduk heals or
revives a demon or death, one should probably supply some words for sense: “the one
afflicted by” or the like. The hymn once again affirms Marduk’s compassionate nature as
do many other texts. Note, e.g., this phrase from Šurpu VII 77: Marduk bēlu rēmēnû ša mīta
bulluṭa irammu, “Marduk, the merciful lord, who loves to heal the dying” (CAD M/2, 140).

Line 23: Qabû, “to speak.” Gillatu, “sin.” Ušrašši is a ŠD durative from rašû, “to ac-
quire.” According to Moran, this is the first attestation of rašû in this stem (258). Its mean-
ing here is causative, “to cause someone to acquire something.” In light of gillatu, “to im-
pute” seems a contextually appropriate definition. Marduk need only speak and he reckons
sin to someone’s account. The offending party is not even mentioned. Whatever one’s ac-
tions may be, it is the judgment of Marduk that determines one’s guilt. This shows another
side to Marduk’s absolute sovereignty.
iqabbī-ma gillata ušrašši
Line 24: Išartu, “prosperity, righteousness, justice.” Putaṭṭuru (Dt of paṭāru), “to be
released, to be forgiven.” Eʾiltu, “bond, liability, sin.” Annu (arnu), “guilt, penalty, fault,
sin.” The couplet in lines 23–24 shows several structural and grammatical parallelisms to
the one in lines 25–26.
ina ūmi išartīšu uptaṭṭarū eʾiltum u annu
Line 25: Šū-ma is the 3ms independent pronoun, “he,” with the enclitic –ma. It em-
phasizes the implied subject of the verb, Marduk. Utukku, “demon,” is in apposition to the
following noun: raʾību, “shivering, cramp,” also known to be the name of the demon be-
hind the medical condition (see qāt Raʾību, CAD R, 81). Šuršû (Š of rašû), “to cause some-
one to acquire (something).” This is the more common causative stem for rašû. One’s trans-
lation must supply the second object, the person on whom the disease is imposed.
Although Marduk imputes guilt and causes illness, the hymn is (apparently) free of cyni-
cism or bitterness. Marduk’s capricious disposition is simply accepted. Apart from some
very poignant but passing protest in Tablet II (lines 10–47), Ludlul’s author seems resigned
to the will and ways of Marduk (see II 48).
šū-ma utakka raʾība ušarši
Line 26: Tû, “incantation.” Marduk and his father Ea were famous for their effective
incantatory word (see, e.g., Enūma eliš IV 19–28, 61; VI 153; VII 11, 26, 33–34 and the
prayer to Ea in this volume, page 227). Šuruppû, “frost, chills.” Ḫurbāšu, “frost, shivering,
cold tremors.” The verb ušdapparu is another ŠD stem durative from the root duppuru (so
CAD D, 186–88, defended by William Moran, “duppuru [dubburu] — ṭuppuru, too?” JCS 33
[1981], 44–47) or ṭuppuru (D of ṭapāru, so AHw, 1380 and CDA, 413). The meaning of the
ŠD, attested only here to my knowledge, follows the D stem, “to drive away.” The final –u
on the verb (in all three MSS attesting this line, MSS gg, ff, and JJ, from Babylon, Nimrud,
and Nineveh, respectively) presents a problem with regard to the subject of the verb. If
šuruppû and ḫurbāšu are the subjects (and the final –ū is the 3mp suffix on the verb), we
would expect the verb to be passive, “they were driven away.” We might even expect this
grammatical understanding given the other parallels between lines 23–24 and 25–26 (note
especially the compound subject at the end of line 24 and the passive, plural verb in its𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

middle). But the verb clearly is not passive—at least, if the decipherment is correct. That
leaves Marduk as the subject and the unnecessary final –u on the verb, which cannot be
explained as a subjunctive. Given this impasse, perhaps we could explain the –u as a scrib-
al mistake, the result of an early scribe understanding šuruppû and ḫurbāšu as the subject of
the (rare) verb due to the false expectation generated by the parallelisms between lines
23–24 and 25–26. But this is only a conjecture. When the textual basis for this line im-
proves, a clearer answer may arise.
ina têšu ušdapparu šuruppû u ḫurbāšu
Line 27: Riḫiṣtu, “flooding.” George and Al-Rawi, 198 disagree with this restoration
but offer no alternative. Miḫiṣtu, “strike, blow, wound.” Notice the consonance between
the two words. d IŠKUR = Adad, a storm god. Erra was a god associated with war, plague,
and destruction (see page 85). The first word of the line is very problematic. The signs that
comprise the verb are securely attested (in one MS ) but there is widespread disagreement
about how to understand them (see George and Al-Rawi, 198 for several options).
Mušmanṭi is here assumed to stand for mušmaṭṭi, a proposed ŠD participle of the root maṭû,
“to be(come) small.” A very tentative understanding of the verb as “who makes slight” (see
the meaning of the D stem) aligns itself with Foster’s “who dwarfs(?)” (395). On this ren-
dering, the line suggests that Marduk’s rage is so severe that it makes the destruction of
Adad and Erra seem small. This understanding stands in contrast with the mercy Marduk
effects in I 28. But like so many other translation problems in Ludlul, this solution must
remain tentative.
mušmanṭi riḫiṣti Adad miḫiṣti Erra
Line 28: Sullumu (D of salāmu), “to soothe, to reconcile, to create peace.” Ištaru, “(per-
sonal) goddess.” Šabbasû, “very angry.” The adj. is mp and modifies both ilu and ištaru.
musallim ilu u ištaru šabbasûti
Line 29: A renewed invocation begins the line. Lines 29–32 underline Marduk’s abso-
lute inscrutability and therefore superiority even among his peers, the other gods. Mimma,
“everything, anything, all.” ŠÀ = libbu, “heart, mind.” Barû, “to see.” Marduk sees, which
implies he knows, everything the gods are doing.
bēlum mimma libbi ilī ibarri
Line 30: Manāma, “someone,” with negative, “no one.” Alaktu, “way, course,” refers
to Marduk’s decisions. No one among the gods can determine Marduk’s intent (see line 32.)
Ul, “not.” Edû (idû), “to know.” Īde is preterite in form but the tense of the verb must be
derived from context.

Line 31: This line repeats line 29, replacing bēlum with Marduk’s name.

Line 32: Line 32 repeats the sense of line 30 in different words. Ayyumma, “any,”
with negative, “none, no one.” Lamādu, “to learn.” Ṭēnu (ṭēmu), “(fore)thought, plan, in-
struction, understanding.” The n of this noun assimilates to the following š in the pronom-
inal suffix (see the normalization).
ilu ayyumma ul ilammad ṭēššu
Line 33: The unusual construction ana kī (von Soden, TUAT III/1, 117) prepares for a
contrastive comparison of Marduk’s nature in the first and second halves of each of the
following two lines. This intra-line contrast (rather than contrasting adjacent lines) has not
appeared in the hymn since lines 2 and 4. For kabtu, see line 17. For qātu, see line 9 and
note that –tš– (at the junction of the noun and suffix) changes to –ss–. Rēmēnû, “merciful.”
In lines 33–34, the first half of the line concerns instruments on the exterior of the body
that are capable of violence (hand, a bodily agent, and weapons, the hand’s instrument).
The second half describes internal body parts, representing positive intentions and/or
emotions.
ana kī kabtat qāssu libbašu rēmēnî
Line 34: Gaṣṣu, “cruel, murderous.” GIŠ . TUKUL = kakku, “weapon.” For kabattu, see
line 8. Šunuššu (Š of nêšu), “to keep alive, to sustain.” The form of the word is a participle
used predicatively (3fs). Marduk is called an ilu mušneššu in Enūma eliš VI 151.
ana kī gaṣṣū kakkūšu kabattašu mušneššat
Line 35: Ša lā, “without.” “Without his heart, mind” seems to refer to a lack of Mar-
duk’s consent. Mannu, “who?” Šupšuḫu (Š of pašāḫu), “to cause to rest, to pacify, to calm.”
Without Marduk’s consent, no one can avert what he inflicts.
ša lā libbīšu mannu miḫiṣtašu lišapšiḫ
Line 36: This line restates the idea in line 35 in different words. Ela, “apart from, in
the absence of.” Ayyu, “which (person)?” Šūlulu (Š of alālu), “to cause to hang,” with qātu
as object, “to stay one’s hand.” The line makes clear that no one can thwart what Marduk
intends to do. Obviously, lines 35–36 are not internally contrastive as lines 33–34 were
nor do they form an antithetical couplet as many of the previous lines do. Rather, the cou-
plet seems to end this part of the hymn on a negative note, emphasizing Marduk’s unstop-𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

pable prerogative to punish. Miḫiṣtu (as in line 27) and qātu are the objects of the verbs in

qātu the agent is here paired to miḫiṣtu the agent’s action.

Line 37: Šūpû (Š of [w]apû), “to make manifest, to make glorious, to proclaim.” Lines
37 and 39 return to the first person voice, which has been absent in the poem since line 1.
Like line 1, both verbs are in the precative and, conspicuously, commence their respective
lines. Uggatu, see line 5. The rest of line 37 is a subordinate clause that further describes
the first person speaker. kīma, see line 5. Nūnu, “fish.” Akālu, “to eat.” Rušumtu, “mud,
silt.” Fish and birds are attested in rituals describing the most distant removal of an un-
wanted item, e.g., sin (see the examples cited in CAD N/2, 339). The two animals have
access to the extremes of the cosmos in that birds fly to the heavens and fish swim into the
depths. Here in line 37 the sufferer is using the fish simile, I think, to state that he was at
the lowest point to which a creature could descend. The simile probably reflects the fact
that a common fish in the Euphrates, carp, was a bottom dweller that would scour the
riverbed for food.
lušāpi uggassu ša kīma nūni ākulu rušumtu
Line 38: A pair of couplets (lines 37–40) closes the hymn, though they are not strong-
ly antithetical as in previous lines. There is, however, a clear antithesis in terms of agents.
In the first member of each couplet the (first person) speaker of the hymn is the subject of
the verbs (see the first person verbs in lines 37 and 39). In the second member of each
couplet (lines 38 and 40), Marduk or one of his attributes is subject. Enēnu, “to grant fa-
vor.” The –am ending on the verb is the 1cs dative suffix, showing to whom favor was
granted. Enēnu here is an a/u verb whereas the homonymous root used in Ludlul I 41,
meaning to “punish,” is i/i. Zamar, see line 18 (compare the use of arḫiš in Ludlul III 50
and the problematic IV 28, according to Annus and Lenzi’s numbering, to describe the
sufferer’s rapid recovery). Kī here probably means “when,” “like,” or “just as” (compare
line 6). Bulluṭu (D of balāṭu), see line 22. Mītūtu could be understood as the abstract noun
“(state of) death.” In this case, we would need to supply, as in line 22, “the one afflicted
by.” More likely, one could understand mītūtu as a pl. substantival use of the adj. mītu,
“dead” (see similarly line 10). In any case, the idea in the line is that the sufferer eventual-
ly becomes the object of Marduk’s mercy, which he has extolled earlier.
īnunam-ma zamar kī uballiṭu mītūtu
Line 39: Šulmudu (Š of lamādu), “to teach.” UN . MEŠ = nišū, “people.” On the sufferer’s
role as teacher, see also Ludlul II 18, 32, and III line p. Qitrubu (Gt of qerēbu), “to come
close up,” in the pred. means “is imminent.” Qitruba is a 3ms pred. with the ventive.
Gumālu is a hapax, according to George and Al-Rawi (198), and may mean something like
“mercy, clemency” (see the CDA’s online archive at http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/
cda_archive/lemmata.htm). It is currently not in any of the dictionaries. MS ff, though bro-49640. ḫi-is-sa-as-su SIG 5 -tu[m] [ar ? ]-na ? -ši-na lit-bal
ken (gi-[mil-šin]), probably used the more common cognate gimillu, “favor, a turn in kind
(both requested and bestowed),” here. Since the purās-noun formation is often used with
prayer-words (see GAG §55k sub 15b), we might place gumālu in this semantic field; thus,
the word could be specifically defined as “a plea for favor, mercy, clemency (something
both requested and bestowed).” The 3fp pronominal suffix on the noun associates gumālu
with nišū (fp), mentioned earlier in the line. This antecedent to the pronoun creates a par-
allel with the noun to which –šina is attached in line 40.
lušalmid-ma nišī qitruba gumālšin
Line 40: The term ḫissatu is used elsewhere to indicate intelligence, understanding,
remembrance, or thought for someone (see CAD Ḫ, 201 and CDA, 117). There are only a
couple of instances in which the term is used with deities, the most important of which for
our purposes describes a person “who recovered on account of the ḫissatu of Marduk,” [ša
ina] ḫissat Marduk ibluṭu (cited in CAD Ḫ, 202). The CAD translates ḫissatu here with
“grace.” However one chooses to translate the term, it ought to convey the general idea
that Marduk shows benevolent consideration for people. SIG 5 = damqu (m), damiqtu (f),
“good, favorable, kind.” Arnu, see line 24. This reconstruction is highly questionable in
light of a re-examination of MS ff, which is the only tablet that preserves any hint of the
word that once lay before the pronominal suffix. Tabālu, “to carry off, to take away.” The
sufferer ends his hymn with a wish that builds on the optimistic statement in line 39: that
Marduk, having heard the people’s plea, will take away their sin. This is the only time in
the entire opening hymn that we see an explicit statement attributing sin to humans.

C OMPARATIVE S UGGESTIONS :
Our hymn offers many points of departure for the reader inclined to com-
pare it with biblical literature. Divine anger and its impact on human experience
are probably the most obvious and broadest thematic issues communicated in the
hymn. But space does not allow even a foray into this vast and complex subject. 1
Rather, the comparative suggestions here are limited to two more manageable
issues: the use of BH’s cognate to bēlu, ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
and the cultural-literary associations
of the morning hours of the day.
The Akkadian construction bēl X, “lord of X,” has an etymological equivalent
in BH’s X ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“lord of X.” Like its Akkadian mate, this phrase can refer to a per-
son responsible for or possessor of the noun that follows. Compare bēl šutummi,
“steward of the storehouse,” with ‫יר‬ ‫ע‬ ִ ‫ה‬ ָ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫בּ‬,
“lords of the city, citizens” (e.g., Jud
9:51); bēl narkabti, “charioteer,” with ‫ים‬ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ָ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫ה‬ ַ ‫י‬ ‫ל‬ ֵ ‫ע‬ ֲ ‫בּ‬,
“horsemen” (2 Sam 1:6); and
bēl dabābi, “adversary” (lit. “owner of a lawsuit”) with ‫י‬ ‫ט‬ ִ ‫פּ‬ ָ ‫שׁ‬ ְ ‫מ‬ ִ ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“my adversary”
(Isa 50:8; lit. “owner of my dispute”).
1
Compare, e.g., the very different attitudes about and contexts for divine anger in Nah 1:2–8 and
Job 9:2–24. The latter passage is remarkable for its bitterness, quite in contrast to what we see in
Ludlul’s opening hymn. For a broad treatment of theodicy in the biblical world, see Antti Laato
and Johannes C. de Moor, ed. Theodicy in the World of the Bible: The Goodness of God and the Prob-
lem of Evil (Leiden: Brill, 2003).𒌋𒑆 A H YMN TO M ARDUK : L UDLUL BĒL NĒMEQI I 1–40

Just as Akkadian bēlu came to be a proper name for Marduk (Bēl), the Bibli-
cal Hebrew term ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ was used as an epithet and/or name of an important Ca-
naanite storm-deity, Baal (Northwest Semitic, Baʿlu), who may be related to the
Syrian and Mesopotamian Ḫaddu/Adad. 1 Some of Baal’s local manifestations are
attested in the Bible: Baal-Peor (see, e.g., Num 25:3, 5), Baal-Berith (god of She-
chem, see Judg 8:33, 9:4), and Baal-Zebub (“Lord of the flies,” god of Ekron in 2
Kings 1, though this title is probably a distortion of the original Baal-Zebul,
“Lord Prince”); 2 still other local manifestations are preserved in nine biblical
toponyms (e.g., Baal-Gad in Josh 11:17, 12:7, and 13:3). 3 Although some of
Baal’s features were appropriated into the mythology of Yahweh by biblical au-
thors, 4 the use of the originally generic term ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ for the Canaanite deity moti-
vated other biblical authors to reject the term for Yahweh altogether (see espe-
cially Hos 2:18, but note the PN ‫ה‬ ָ‫י‬ ְ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬,
“Yahweh is lord,” in 1 Chron 12:5).
Apparently, so hated was the epithet/god that early scribes changed attestations
of the god’s name in the Bible to the derogatory ‫ת‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ‫ה‬,
“the shame” (see Jer
3:24, 11:13, and Hos 9:10), even going so far as to replace the appellation with
‫ת‬ ‫ֹשׁ‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ when it appears as a theophoric element in personal names (compare, e.g.,
Ish-boshet in 2 Sam 2:8, etc. with Eshbaal in 1 Chron 8:33, 9:39). 5 Of course, the
biblical authors called Yahweh lord, but they did so with the term ‫דוֹן‬ ‫א‬.

This Levantine religious polemic may have made the Judean’s encounter
with Marduk’s related title, Bēl, during the Babylonian crisis of the sixth century
all the more bitter. In several predictions of Babylonian destruction Judean

Opinions vary on the identity of Baal and Adad. See the treatments of the issue in J. C. de
Moor and M. J. Mulder, “‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ baʿal,” TDOT 2:192–99; J. Day, “Baal (Deity),” ABD 1:543; and W.
Herrmann, “Baal,” DDD, 132. For fuller treatments of the storm god, see Alberto R. W. Green,
The Storm-god in the Ancient Near East (Biblical and Judaic Studies from the University of Califor-
nia, San Diego 8; Winona Lake: Eisenbrauns, 2003), who treats the biblical material, too, and the
encyclopedic tome from Daniel Schwemer, Die Wettergottgestalten Mesopotamiens und Nordsyriens
im Zeitalter der Keilschriftkulturen (Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2001). See also the literature

See the other eight toponyms in HALOT, 144 and N. Na’aman, “Baal Toponyms,” DDD, 140–41
(and related entries). The plural form of the noun, ‫ים‬ ִ‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ָ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫ה‬,
appears 18 times in the Hebrew Bible
but its meaning is not entirely clear. The term may have been used for various local manifesta-
tions of Baal or a more generic term for Canaanite gods in general (see J. Day, “Baal (Deity),”
547).

See the convenient précis in Day, “Baal (Deity),” 548–49. A classic essay on this issue is Frank
Moore Cross’s chapter “Yahweh and Baʿl” (pp. 147–94) in Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Es-
says in the History of the Religion of Israel (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1973). See also
Reinhard Muller, Jahwe als Wettergott: Studien zur althebraischen Kultlyrik anhand ausgewahlter
Psalmen (BZAW 387; Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008). The use of storm imagery for Yahweh, of
course, brings up a topic that intersects with our hymn (see line 5).

See de Moor and Mulder, “‫ל‬ ‫ע‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ַ baʿal,” 193, who note these changes are limited to the book of
Samuel.

See K. Spronk, “Lord,” DDD, 531–33 for more about this title, which eventually became a pious
substitute (‫י‬ ‫דוֹנ‬
‫)א‬
for the Tetragrammaton.498prophets seem to relish the idea of the great Babylonian Bel’s (‫ל‬ ‫)בּ‬
defeat and
putting to shame (see Jer 50:2, 51:44, and Isa 46:1–2).
The opening several lines of our hymn associate Marduk’s favorable nature
(i.e., relenting from anger) with the morning (see line 2, 4, and 6). This manner
of speaking recalls passages in the Psalter that associate the morning with divine
help or hope for divine mercy. 7 Interestingly, several of these passages also occur
in the context of a person lamenting divine displeasure. See, for example, Pss
46:6, 59:17 (and contrast the psalmist’s enemies who are depicted as dogs roam-
ing about in the evening in vv. 7 and 15), 90:14 (with vv. 5–6), and 143:8. In Ps
130:6 the psalmist describes themselves waiting on Yahweh’s favorable answer
to their cry with more anticipation than the watchmen awaiting the appearance
of the morning. Such a comparison confirms rather explicitly the expectation
and hope associated with the morning hours. In light of our Akkadian hymn, Ps
30:6 provides a particularly interesting example of the contrast between
night/divine anger and morning/divine favor. In the context of thanksgiving for
deliverance (vv. 2–4), the psalmist calls on others to praise Yahweh (v. 5), offer-
ing the following as further support for the exhortation to praise: ‫ים‬ ִ‫יּ‬ ‫ח‬ ַ ‫פּוֹ‬ ‫א‬ ַ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫ע‬ ‫ג‬ ַ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫י‬ ‫כּ‬ ִ
‫ה‬ ָ‫נּ‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ר‬ ‫ֹק‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ‫ל‬ ַ ְ‫ו‬ ‫י‬ ‫כ‬ ִ ‫בּ‬ ֶ ‫ין‬ ‫ל‬ ִ ָ‫י‬ ‫ב‬ ‫ר‬ ֶ ‫ע‬ ֶ ‫בּ‬ ָ ‫צוֹנוֹ‬ ‫ר‬ ְ ‫בּ‬,
“although (one is) a moment in his anger, (there is) a
lifetime in his favor; weeping lodges in the evening, (but) jubilation belongs to
the morning.” The Psalter also presents the morning as an appropriate time to
request Yahweh’s favor (see Pss 5:4 and 88:14) and indicates in Ps 101:8 that
judgment of the wicked (i.e., vindication for the psalmist) occurs every morning
(‫ים‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ק‬ ָ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫;ל‬
see also Zeph 3:5). Clearly, the morning was often associated with good
things for those in distress. This might make us read the lament in Ps 73:14 as
especially bitter, for there the psalmist complains that every morning brings new
afflictions (see also Ps 55:10, where the psalmist complains morning, noon, and
night).
Why exactly the morning was so often associated with expectation of or
requests for Yahweh’s favor has elicited several creative explanations. 8 Joseph
Blenkinsopp may be closest to understanding the issue when he explains the
association as “simply the feeling that morning puts an end to night as a time of
danger and fear; it is a time for new beginnings.” 9
7
The most famous passage in the Bible in this regard may be the optimistic statement in Lam
3:22–23, where the kindnesses of Yahweh (‫ה‬ ָ‫הֹו‬ ‫י‬ ְ ‫י‬ ‫ד‬ ֵ ‫ס‬ ְ ‫)ח‬
are said to be new every morning (‫ים‬ ‫שׁ‬ ִ ‫ד‬ ָ ‫ח‬ ֲ
‫ים‬ ‫ר‬ ִ ‫ק‬ ָ ‫בּ‬ ְ ‫)ל‬.

T RANSLATION :
1. I will praise the lord of wisdom, the circumspect god,
2. Angry at night (but) relenting at daybreak.
3. Marduk, the lord of wisdom, the circumspect god,
4. Angry at night (but) relenting at daybreak.
5. Whose fury, like a violent storm, is a wasteland,
6. But whose blowing, like a breeze of the morning hours, is pleasant.
7. (Who) in his anger is irresistible, his fury a flood,
8. (But) his heart is merciful, his mood relenting.
9. The brunt of whose hand the heavens cannot bear,
10. (But) whose palm is (so) gentle it aids the dying.
11. Marduk, the brunt of whose hand the heavens cannot bear,
12. (But) whose palm is so gentle it aids the dying.
13. On account of whose wrath, graves are opened,
14. At that time he raises up the fallen from catastrophe.
15. He frowns: the divine guardian and protective spirit withdraw.
16. He takes notice: his god turns back to him whom he had rejected.
17. His grievous punishment is immediately overbearing,
18. He shows pity and instantly becomes motherly.
19. He hastens to treat his beloved kindly,
20. And like a cow with a calf, he is ever attentive.
21. His beatings are barbed, they pierce the body,
22. (But) his bandages mollify, they restore (the one afflicted by) the Namtar-
demon.
23. He speaks, and he imputes sin,
24. (But) on his day of justice liability and guilt are absolved.
25. He makes (one) acquire the demon shivering,
26. (But) with his incantation he expels chills and cold tremors.
27. Who makes slight(?) the flood(?) of Adad, the blow of Erra,
28. (But) who reconciles (one’s) enraged god and goddess.
29. The Lord, he sees everything in the heart of the gods,
30. (But) no one among the gods knows his way.
31. Marduk, he sees everything in the heart of the gods,
32. (But) no god can learn his counsel.
33. As heavy as is his hand, his heart is merciful.
34. As murderous as are his weapons, his intention is life-sustaining.
35. Without his consent, who may assuage his striking?
36. Apart from his intention, who may stay his hand?
37. I, who ate mud like a fish, will extol his anger.
38. He quickly bestowed favor on me, just as he restored the dead.
39. I will teach the people that their plea for favor is near.
40. May his sympathetic concern carry off their sin.500C UNEIFORM :

22.17, 385There are few resources for students of the Bible who wish to
work with ancient Near Eastern textual materials in the original
languages but have only an intermediate level of linguistic
aptitude. The field needs something that offers glosses on
vocabulary, grammatical notes, basic literary commentary, and
comparative suggestions about how the text connects to biblical
material. This book provides such a tool for a body of material
that has long occupied comparatively inclined biblical scholars.
The introduction gives a panoramic overview of Akkadian
prayers and hymns, their cultural and literary background,
and the history of modern scholarship’s use of these texts
for understanding the Hebrew Bible, and the volume offers
extensive linguistic, literary, and cultural commentary for the
hymns and prayers in a line-by-line manner.
Alan Lenzi is Assistant Professor of Hebrew Bible and the
Ancient Near East at University of the Pacific. He is the author of
Secrecy and the Gods: Secret Knowledge in Ancient Mesopotamia
and Biblical Israel (The Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project).
