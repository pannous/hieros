# There is a key-like sequence in the right margin apparently added after
# the main text was written. Unclear in Petersen copies, but seems to be
# the roman alphabet. It starts at the end of the second line and it
# is not well aligned with the rest of the lines: a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,
# i,{j is missing}k,{l,m,n are not readable},o,p,q,r
# There is non-Voynich text at bottom of folio: the signature
# of Jacobus de Tepenecz
# At the end of the paragraphs there are further words (right justified)
# as if they were the name of the author in a quotation.
# The space between the paragraph and these "signatures" is marked with a
# {space} comment.
# Next to the end of the 1st. line there is a thick non-Voynich symbol
# resembling an underlined 29 and marked {doodle}
# The 2nd and 3rd paragraphs start with thick non-Voynich symbols. These
# are also marked {doodle}

# General description of page:
# Three concentric rings of text. In the centre are two fish (the astrological

# March 20th.
# Between the inner ring and the middle ring are ten female(?) figures, each
# beside a barrel and holding a star. Between the middle and the outer ring
# are 19 (NOT 20) female figures, each standing in a barrel and holding a star
# Each of the figures in the 29 figures is labelled with a "word" or phrase
# of Voynich text.

# General description of page:
# Three concentric rings of text, locus indications C1 to C3 (outer
# to inner). In the centre is a Taurus feeding from a manger. Below
# the bull is the word ``May'' in the Roman alphabet. Between the
# inner ring of text and the middle ring are five
# human figures, each in a barrel, holding a star, and labelled with a word
# of Voynich text. One is naked, four are clothed. Between the middle ring
# and the outer ring are 10 human figures, each in a barrel, holding a star,
# and labeled with a word of Voynich text. Two are naked, eight are clothed.
# Newbold calls this folio 79 and he reads the date of the comet 1273.
# The photograph in Newbold is cropped, so part of ring C1 isn't visible.
