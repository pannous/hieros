# In the Voynich manuscript I count 290 occurrences. In Hamilton's text I cannot find any occurrence of triple reduplication, while in the Voynich manuscript there are about 10. I believe this evidence suggests that the phenomenon is accidental in Hilton and systematic in the Voynich manuscript.

# Voynich Manuscript’s curious text presents so many different kinds of non-language-like behaviours all at the same time that trying to read it as if it were a simple language (even a polyglot mash-up “simple language”) is never, ever going to work.

# – 1) Low entropy (highly predictable, babble-like text)
# – 2) Highly structured letter placement rules (e.g. highly stylized word beginnings and endings)
# – 3) Two or more significant language variants
# – 4) A surprisingly high (dictionary size) : (corpus size) ratio.
# – 5) A generative dictionary (i.e. covering many more permutations than normal languages do)
# – 6) Only sporadic word adjacency pattern matches
# – 7) Neal keys (both vertical and horizontal)
# – 8) Where are common words like “the” and “and”?
# – 9) Where are the number shapes, number clusters, or number patterns?
# – (etc)
