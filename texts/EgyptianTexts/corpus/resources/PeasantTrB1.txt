Transliteration and translation for The Eloquent Peasant, following
the transcription of Parkinson (1991). Version B1 is given where it is
the main version, or where it differs substantially from the other
versions.

The transliteration throughout follows Hannig (1995).

For published translations, see Lichtheim (1975), pp. 169-184;
Parkinson (1997), pp. 54-88; Simpson (1972), pp. 31-49. Further,
Goedicke (1998) covers the second petition (the text from B1 119 to B1
170); Zonhoven (1992), pp. 271-272, covers the text up to B1 119. Also
considered where the examples from Allen (2000), Gardiner (1957),
Graefe (1994) and Loprieno (1995).
