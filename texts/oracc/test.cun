#(1) "(If) an eclipse takes place on the 14th of Nisannu (I) and the god in its eclipsing becomes dark on the side south above (elānu) and clears on the side north below (šaplānu)" (= EAE XX §I 1), it is said on account of the upper part of the (moon) disk, (since) "beginning" means "top" (elānu); and KI.TA means "bottom."
